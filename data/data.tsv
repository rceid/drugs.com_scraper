Abacavir	HIV Infection	Sorry to say this drug Abacavir definitely had a very bad unpleasant stressful adverse  effect felt in my heart, it was beating harder and surrounding heart area felt a bit off.  After continuing a few doses of Abacavir over a few days I could no longer tolerate or cope with the continuing higher persistent distress of my heart noticeably beating harder around the clock and happily quit taking Abacavir with noticeably rapid overall relief and improvement of no longer noticing any further adverse distressful symptoms with and around my heart.  I definitely feel Abacavir is a very potential danger to the heart!!!!	1	March 21, 2019	2

Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	HIV Infection	I have been HIV positive since 1999. I am 45 years old now. I have been on many regimens over the years. 2015 I switched to Triumeq. 6 years maintaining undetectable virus. Cd4 counts been between 600 and 900.  Joint pain, dizzy spells, high blood pressure, high triglycerides, anxiety, shoulder achyness, recently. Not sure if its because of medicine or bad eating and lack of exercise.	8	April 22, 2021	0
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	HIV Infection	Been positive 34 years, doing fine but decided to change to tthe 1 pill a day instead of 5. This drug may work for some but NOT FOR ME !  have issues with depression and anxiety  and were amplified 100x on this drug. Blood pressure went sky high, headaches, swollen eyes, couldn't eat or sleep. Couldn't function. Went back to original meds, Kaletra and Truvada. Feeling better. They can keep their 1 pill a day!!	1	April 5, 2021	1
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	HIV Infection	I took Triumeq for about a year and I didn't have any side effects for the first six months.  I started getting dizzy spells, felt super emotional for no reason, very sore around my eyes constantly which felt like I had been punched, and the worst was extreme fatigue no matter how long I slept.  I switched to Odefsey and feel much better but I gained a little weight and my hair is thinning and breaking now.	7	February 8, 2021	0
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	HIV Infection	Switched to Triumeq in 2015 after being on Atripla for many years and undetectable. Facial wasting appeared recently.	8	November 8, 2020	2
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	HIV Infection	Great pills! Im useing Tmq from 2017. My CD4 is 1200 and viral load is 0. In the beginning it was 100 000, and after 1 month it was 0. My CD4 was 200 and after 1 year of usein Tmq it was completely recovered, 1200, and it is like that for last 2 years. I have very dry skin and sometime sleeping problems.	10	February 29, 2020	12
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	HIV Infection	Been on Triumeq for a week now and I'm not 100% happy. My last meds stopped working even though I had 100% adherence. Since taking Triumeq I've not slept properly (taking me ages to fall asleep and then waking during the night and taking a long time to go back to sleep) and I'm someone who normally sleeps like a kitten. The other thing I've noticed is really itchy skin: face, neck, torso, legs....no rash, just constant itchy feeling. I've had a couple of dizzy spells one of which made me panic and my heart rate went up to 134 (I was just washing the dishes!). I'll stick with them as one week is too short a time to decide if I can live with the side effects or if they are just temporary. I'll post again in a few weeks.	5	November 19, 2019	12
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	HIV Infection	I started this medication with a VL of 16000 and CD4 451. It didn't cause me any side effects (so far), and after two months I reached undetectable and a CD4 of 668.	10	August 21, 2019	5
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	HIV Infection	I took Triumeq from early 2016 to early 2017. Although it kept my viral load undetectable, I suffered serious side effects: Bizarre dreams, burping and acid reflux, and serious heart diseases. It caused irregular heart beats, and my heart rates went up to 200 beats per minute when I did light exercises (elliptical) which caused blood pressure to drop so low I collapsed. I also experienced blackout for a brief second several times a day, during walking, sitting, and out of nowhere. I also developed a stenosis on my artery, it's fat buildup in my main blood vessel on my neck that caused my blood flow to drop to 40-50% of normal. And if the fat gets detached and goes into my brain, I will have a stroke. Cardiologist said I should not have heart problem because there is no history of heart disease in my family, and I am not overweight, and this problem only started after taking Triumeq. So doctor changed medication to Descovy + Tivicay, and all the aforementioned side effects went away.	2	June 16, 2019	14
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	HIV Infection	I found I am HIV positive by the end of August 2018 and back then had VL over 1 million (really high) and CD4 around 650 (30%) and I started the treatment with Triumeq by the end of October. For the first month I was taking Triumeq before going to bed and I experienced all side effects related with the central nervous system such as insomnia, headache, tiredness, unfocused etc. By the end of November the VL has drooped to 650k and  CD4 went up to 1000 (40%). Despite the side effects that were clearly affecting my daily life both personal and professional because I was all the time tired and sleepy, the doctor and I agreed that I'd give one more month to Triumeq switching it to the mornings. It literally solved all the side effects I haven't experienced any of them since I started taking the pill in the morning. At the beginning of January 2019, around 2/2.5 months after starting the treatment, I'm undetectable and in March I had again CD4 count and was still in good level - 1050 (43%).	10	June 9, 2019	11
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	HIV Infection	Was HIV diagnosed April 1st 2019  My CD4 was at 650 and my viral load was 118.000 after 4 weeks of using Triumeq my viral load is now only 30 :) they didn't re test my CD4 due to it being at 650 :) no side affects either, a little bloated at times but nothing major. I work out 5 times a week and believe this helps a lot. 	10	May 22, 2019	9
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	HIV Infection	I found out that I'm HIV positive on March 2019. Since my CD4 was at 67 Cells, and my VL at 42.000, my Doc started immediately with Triumeq. After a Month, I was undetectable. I don't know, how my CD4 has risen, but I have nearly no side effects. I take it in the morning, and I feel a bit of fatigue, but nothing else. I'm paying 10 Euro per 30 tablets, my insurance covers.	9	April 25, 2019	7
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	HIV Infection	Triumeq is a good treatment,  no side effect except for appendicitis which was a  few months after start taking the tablet.  I got appendicitis  and there have been a few similar cases. Apart from this no other sides effects  first treatment, and year next month ,  undetectable after 2  months start taking	9	March 13, 2019	5
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	HIV Infection	The only problem I have is the cost when I get switched to Medicare Part D. My cost at that time will be $725.00 per month for 30 pills.	10	January 26, 2019	3
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	HIV Infection	I was diagnosed HIV+ in April 2014, it was about a year until my CD4 count dropped to 500, I tried 1 medication for about a month that made me ill, so I was switched to Triumeq, it's a lot better, but not without its side effects, up to 4 hours after taking I have make sure there is a toilet near as it makes me go pretty quick. I also get headaches and tiredness for up to 2 hours after taking then it's like I just push through it. Overall it's good, I can't complain, I mean what's the other option????...lol, I'm glad medicine is moving on so well.  Rich United Kingdom	8	December 4, 2018	9
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	HIV Infection	"November 2016 was my initial HIV+ detection.  I learned that I had a 1 million+ viral load and only 46 T-cells.   Today, I am undetectable.  Undetectable!  It is with some seriously amazing awe that I also read on my latest blood work that my T-cell count is now 402!  My infectious disease doctor told me that I might be experiencing ""IRIS"" (immune reconstitution syndrome) and believes that if I am adherent to the prescription regimen, I may see a 500 t-cell count in the coming year.  Several good people prayed for me; for them I am truly grateful.  I am also taking time to write here because I am convinced that Triumeq saved my life.  I hope my comments can be of help to others."	10	December 2, 2018	24
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	HIV Infection	Diagnosed in July with an unknown infection date.     First test showed a CD4 of 550 and VL of 38000.  Started medication late due to some fights with the insurance company.    Took my first pill on September 7.   Had my follow up blood work drawn on October 3.   I am NOW undetectable! No changes to my CD4 but I know it will increase.    The only side effect  I have noticed in my first month is some minor bloating.   Had some trouble falling asleep for the first week but I assume that was the power of suggestion having read all the possible symptoms.    I know it is early on to review the medication but I am undetectable in less than 30 days.  I just wanted to share!	10	October 11, 2018	12
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	HIV Infection	Started this about 10 months ago and I haven't had any side effects or trouble with sleeping, I am very thankful for this medicine and pray it keeps me happy and healthy forever!	10	October 9, 2018	11
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	HIV Infection	Just started Triumeq with a CD4 count of 271 and a viral load of 104,000. Other than a slight headache, vivid and lucid dreaming (which was awesome)  and vomiting (I took it on an empty stomach.) I haven't had any other side effects. I take it after I eat breakfast in the morning and go on about my day with normal energy levels. Will update when I get my one month labs done to see the progress of this medication.	9	September 30, 2018	10
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	HIV Infection	Started this medication 6 months ago. After the first month I was undetectable! My counts are fantastic. Only issue I’ve had is that I’ve developed some gastrointestinal problems but I’m totally fine with that. I’d much rather be a bit gassy and bloated than no longer have a functioning immune system.	10	September 29, 2018	15
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	HIV Infection	To be honest I was diagnose + in 2004 and didn't actually started meds right away until my health started to fade away little by little after some time with the virus. So when I decided to get on treatment they started me with Kaletra & Combivir for approximately 3 -5 years after that I became resistant to this cocktail and was switch to something else which I can't recall at the moment since I tried a few different ones. Long story short:I started taking triumeq approximately 2 years ago and they really had help me a lot.	8	September 25, 2018	10
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	HIV Infection	I have had HIV since 2008. On my first medicine which was Atripla I could not sleep,  I had headaches and crazy dreams. Dr. prescribed me Triumeq which I have  no side effects from. My only problem now is the cost of Triumeq I will be going on Medicare Part D in January 2019 my cost will be about $700.00 per month. I'll be broke in about four years.		July 22, 2018	9
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	HIV Infection	I was diagnosed with full-blown AIDS 25 years ago I was taking trezaver then atripla 15 years then I got sick last year I was told that I only have a year to live I get boils all over my body about the size of a baseball. Doctor switched me to triumeq I was hesitated to take it I just opened the bottle after a month I've been taking it now for three days, no side effects yet had a few headaches but that's about all. Please pray for me I have a wife and a family	6	June 26, 2018	27
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	HIV Infection	I was the first reviewer and also posted an update in 2016, thought I would take a second and give an update.  I’m still on Triumeq and still highly recommend this drug.  After switching in 2014 (literally the day the drug was approved), I still have no side effects.  It’s been great.  Best wishes everyone.	10	June 8, 2018	14
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	HIV Infection	I have been HIV positive for 14 years. At first I was on Atripla. It kept me undetectable and a high CD4 (between 600-900). The main side effect that I had was very vivid, disturbing dreams.  So my doctor decided to switch me to Triumeq 4  years ago. I love it. Same high CD4 and undetectable. And I experience no side effects whatsoever. Very thankful for this drug.	10	May 27, 2018	8
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	HIV Infection	I have been on Triumeq for almost 2 years.  Viral load and CD4 are great.  However, I have gained almost 25 pounds....all in gut, back, chest and starting to develop a small buffalo hump.  Nothing in diet or workout regimen has changed. I have gone from a medium T-shirt to a X-Large.  33 size pants to 35 waist.  42 jacket to 44 jacket.  16 collar to a 17-1/2 collar.  Not happy with this at all.  I am seeing more and more reports of this with Triumeq users online now.	5	May 20, 2018	14
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	HIV Infection	I had postponed treatment for around 7 years but now have started. In my recent test my numbers were low (290 CD4) and my VL was about 16k.   This medication is amazing. So far I had no side effect whatsoever and I think a large part of the negative feedback people share could be shaped by their own apprehensions and worries.  Best of all it's easy to take. I am undetectable 4 weeks into treatment. I also feel that I have better energy and my constant worry about what the virus is doing to my body seems to have subsided for now.   Highly recommend	10	May 2, 2018	10
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	HIV Infection	"So I hate to be ""that"" person, but I guess I am.  Was on Genvoya/Stribild since 7/2016 with no issues whatsoever other than elevated cholesterol.  Dr. decided to change me to Triumeq, which I took for 14 days.  I have not been right at all for two weeks.  Extreme headrush (like a combo drunk/stoned feeling), anxious, no energy, itchy everywhere.  Just feel awful after taking it.  We chatted today, going back on Genvoya and cannot wait to go pick it up.  Don't let this scare you, everybody will find their med. that works w/o any side effects.  For me, that is not Triumeq."	3	April 10, 2018	16
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	HIV Infection	Recently started taking Triumeq almost 4 weeks ago. Use to be on the sustiva and combvr cocktail for about 5 years. Always hated taking sustiva made me feel extremely groggy, terrible dreams and so I took it upon myself to stop taking it. Went on a 3 year hiatus. Needed a break from all of it including doctor visits.(terrible idea) fell victim to pneumonia in February and ID dr put me on Triumeq. So far it’s been amazing. 1st night my head became very tingly and I felt real shaky but after that it’s been amazing. No side effects and I’ve started gaining my weight back again. Did lab work yesterday so hopefully my cd4 has gone up. My cd4 was a 12 last test. Good luck to all of you and remember you aren’t alone in this fight.		March 29, 2018	11
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	HIV Infection	I was diagnosed in February of 2016.  My viral load was 180,000 and my cell count was 157.  I had not been sick, but I feel I was on the verge.  I had experienced some trouble with thrush, but that was the worst at that point.  My doctor started me on Triumeq within a week of my diagnosis.  I had absolutely no side effect other than my face itching!  It was strange.  My doc seemed to think it might have been my immune system revving up and doing a number on my Rosacea.  It is better, by the way.  Within four months I was basically undetectable at 95 na d my viral load down to 375.  At last check in October of '17, I was completely undetectable and my cell count up to 567.  I am so very pleased.  Other than the face itching, which has long since stopped, I have had not a single side effect.  I do wish my cell count would go up faster, but I am so thankful that I have no side effects that I can't bring myself to complain!	10	March 11, 2018	6
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	HIV Infection	I found out October 2nd that I was HIV positive. Felt so unhealthy and caught it so fast. Losing weight, loss of appetite, having a really hard time sleeping when you’d always get those heat flash or waking up so hot. It was horrible in my experience. It took me a month to get this medication which is triumeq. The first medication my doctor had told me about and said it was the best one out there. I couldn’t agree more. I’ve been one this medication going on 3 months now and my counts went from 150/500 to over 240/500 within a month. I’m doing way better. I’m way healthier. Even though I don’t like the tiredness and a frequently headache. But I’m telling you this medication works really great. I’ve never felt so much better and felt so much changed since I’ve been on triumeq. I should be undetectable by my next appointment I go to in a month. I couldn’t be more grateful for this medication that could help us all through this situation.		February 10, 2018	5
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	HIV Infection	I was diagnosed a few days before Christmas in 2017. I was going to be put on Atripla but after hearing horror stories I asked for an alternative, after a quick blood test for a gene I was put on Triumeq and after a matter of weeks my viral load went from the hundreds-of-thousands to undetectable and my CD4 has risen ever since, I’m now at 555. I wasn’t sure if I was prescribed Triumeq or a horse tranquilliser at first but even though they are quite big it’s still easier to swallow than some paracetamols. Overall I would rate this 10/10 and the side-effects seem to be nonexistent! I know everyone is different but I do strongly suggest to anyone who is unhappy with their current medications to ask about Triumeq because for me, it’s working wonders!	10	February 9, 2018	8
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	HIV Infection	I was diagnosed December 2018 this is my first day taking the medication. I’m gonna update my phone progress. A little scared as I'm 3 months pregnant and don’t want my unborn to contract the virus.		January 30, 2018	7
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	HIV Infection	I was diagnosed December 2016 with a high viral load (I don’t remember exact numbers anymore) and a cd4 count of 201.   I went on Triumeq the day my diagnosis was confirmed.  The first 4 weeks on this were absolutely terrible.  I could not sleep, had crazy mood swings and was overall not enjoying anything.  (Perhaps it also had to do with the news of this life changing diagnosis) but at my 1 month check up I was undetectable and my cd4 had doubled to 440 making all the sleepless nights completely worth it.   A year later I have continued to be undetectable and have little side effects.   Sometimes my foot goes numb, and my arms and legs fall asleep easily. I do occasionally have night terrors and very vivid dreams, but as a horror movie buff they don’t bother me.   In my opinion this medication is amazing and one of the best out there.	9	January 28, 2018	5
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	HIV Infection	I have been on Triumeq for over a year now and my viral load went from hundreds of thousands to undetectable.  My immune system went from 300 to almost 600 now. I did have appendicitis and had to remove my appendix since beginning this regimen but don't know if its related. I am obese weight at 230lbs an triglycerides are now high and blood pressure too. I'm trying to lower these through change of diet and exercise. Have been experiencing burning sensations in my right big toe and foot pain periodically.  Don't know if related to the drug. Cutting back on processed meats and red meats now hence they cause more inflammation.  This helps tremendously as well as cardio exercise and plenty of water cutting out sodas now too.		December 12, 2017	7
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	HIV Infection	Had horrible sleep problems two weeks after , and then a few weeks later started getting rash. Wouldn't recommend this to anyone trust me, you do not sleep while on this drug. I switched to epivir and tivicay and have had NO issues at all.		October 28, 2017	11
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	HIV Infection	Diagnosed back in 2008. Have been on Atripla for about 10 years and just switched to Triumeq this week. No major side effects whatsoever and best of all I love waking up not feeling groggy or drowsy; also no weird crazy dreams! So far any side effects have been extremely minimal to none. I look forward to this new medication which is reported to be less toxic and based on my own experience would recommend you consider making the switch.		October 24, 2017	9
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	HIV Infection	August 8th 2017 tested positive. Viral load 10,109 cd4 512 Started meds August 27th 2017 Retested September 28th 2017 And viral load is 49 and cd4 865 I had a few minor headaches and I now take my meds with or without food with no problems. I take my meds in the morning at my first break 10 am. Thanks to this site I was nervous at first read all the reviews and they helped me and knowing what to expect. So thought I would return the favor.	10	September 30, 2017	15
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	HIV Infection	Was diagnosed 8/12/17, began treatment 9/25. I was super pumped. Initially had a slight rash and my thumb didn’t work, got too stiff to move two times for like a minute.  Second day I felt great. High energy. Stayed up late. Yesterday I felt like butt all day. Sore. Stomach hurt. Especially when I swallowed food or drink. Today wasn’t a whole lot better. At least yesterday I could eat. I’ve taken 7 Advil  over quite a long and now I can feel the crappiness coming back on. Called my ID specialist and she told me to stop taking it and come in tomorrow morning. I’m disappointed. But I gotta get healthy. My Cd4 counts are 9 and viral load is is 181,000. I just want to get better.	5	September 28, 2017	11
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	HIV Infection	I discovered my new status in July 2017 VL 94K and CD4 126. After 4 weeks I had blood work again and I got an awesome results VL 85 and CD4 360. Hopefully I will be undetectable in my next check. I haven't gotten any symptoms like nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, headaches etc. This medicine has been working greatly into my body.	10	August 27, 2017	7
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	HIV Infection	Infected HIV in February, diagnosed March through my own choice/fear/indecision started Triumeq 2 weeks ago. I have had a very positive experience so far. I have had minor side effects, slight headaches, a little dizzy spell, what feels like mucus on chest but nothing frightening apart from the one dizzy spell. I do feel better overall than I did, no more sore throat and I feel like I have more energy, though I am tired in the evenings and I sleep well. I feel my appetite has increased so am being conscious to exercise every day. I take the Triumeq pill in the morning half way through breakfast, I eat oat porridge for breakfast, eat half and then swallow Triumeq with a large glass of water, then finish porridge.  No nausea/indigestion.		August 17, 2017	8
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	HIV Infection	I switched to this med because my last med put me in a horrible fog (Atripla) . Triumeq is working for me but it gives me pretty bad body aches especially in my lower back where my kidney area is and around my under arms. If I have an alternative I will switch. It makes me feel pretty crappy	4	July 31, 2017	10
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	HIV Infection	Diagnosed in Feb of 2015 and tried 2 other drugs. The last 2 causes so much nausea and vomiting that I couldn't take it. Also, it was messing up my liver. My doctor put me on this and I've had little to no side effects. I have nausea but that's only if I take it on a empty stomach and it only last for about 20 minutes. I'm undetectable now and my CD4 count came from 14 to 376 the last time I checked last year. I'm going back in September to check my progress. This drug saved my life. I was basically on my deathbed before this drug.	9	July 22, 2017	20
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	HIV Infection	Terrible heartburn and intergestion. Easy to take, but went back to sustiva and combivir because of heartburn.	7	June 18, 2017	3
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	HIV Infection	I was born with HIV  my birth mother transfer it & had it all my life. Never taken medicine my immune system dropped drastically I got a thrush in my mouth and my skin started to break out really bad. I've been on triumeq for 3 days and I must say I think I'm only taking this medicine with food. Geez the nausea has been tough and a Lil lost of appetite I did have to use antifungals as well due to the thrush but hoping it does gets better. I'm excited for this journey, it's encouraging to read other stories... 	5	June 12, 2017	11
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	HIV Infection	Was diagnosed in 2002, but started taking truvada and isentress in 2010 before being put on triumeq. CD4 count was 700 and VL was undetectable.  My doctor switched me over and boy the side effects are horrible.  I had stomach aches every day but as I take this medicine they go away. I'm still undetectable  but I want my CD4 count to rise in the 1000's. I love that it is only one pill a day. I will get checked again  in August to see the progress. My numbers have never dropped. Will post in August.		June 3, 2017	5
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	HIV Infection	I tested positive for HIV in January this year and started treatment with Triumeq at the end of February with CD4 < 150 and VL 66,000. On 26 March I had bloodwork again, with CD4 = 415 and VL < 40.  I think the results speak for themselves, this drug is like a nuke. Zero side effects except for general malaise and fatigue during the first couple of days - which I however attribute to Immune Reconstitution Syndrome. Unless you are hypersensitive to abacavir, I believe there is scarcely anything better on the market at the moment.	10	June 2, 2017	9
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	HIV Infection	I was diagnosed in January 2011. My own immune system was able to manage my HIV for a couple years, but my health started to fail in 2013. I started with Atripla, and I'm still recovering from the extremely vivid nightmares I experienced.  I switched to a couple different combinations of drugs, but I couldn't adhere to the dosing schedules. Triumeq has been a godsend. One pill a day, and no nightmares. The only side effects I've experienced are upset stomach, weakness, and headaches.  I had one very bad spell where I nearly lost control of my motor functions and I fell in the bathroom and couldn't get back up for a short period of time.  Otherwise, my CD count has been stable at ~800, and I've been undetectable since 2013.	9	May 1, 2017	12
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	HIV Infection	This medicine worked very well for me within a month of taking it I became undetectable!! I had no major side effects. I do however get head aches every once and awhile but nothing I can't deal with.I currently crush mine and put it in yogurt so I'm still getting used to the taste...yuck..but its not that bad.	10	April 29, 2017	4
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	HIV Infection	Newly diagnosed and Triumeq is the only medication I've ever experienced. Just got results after taking it for 6 weeks. CD4 is just over 1,000. That's up from 764. My viral load is down from 33K to 26K. So far so good. I'm hoping to be undetectable in 3-4 months like I been reading in people's comments. I've had no apparent side effects until very recently I seem to have some jaw tightening and stiffness. But no headaches and I sleep well. I also been really gassy and I MUST EAT when I take it. But I'm a happy camper overall.	10	April 21, 2017	3
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	HIV Infection	I was diagnosed in Feb 2014.   My doctor did some sort of genes/DNA test to see which drug was compatible for my body.   Triumeq was the best option suited for me.  Must admit. At first. It was hard. The first month was as expected. Feeling sick and nausea. Felt like I had to eat when I took my pill. But once into the 2nd month. Things improved. The longer time went on. The less I felt any side affects.   It took me 4 months to be undetected.  By this time I felt myself again.   Now. In 2017. I can take it my meds with or without food. At any time. Sometimes I will take my meds with wine or on a complete empty stomach and feel nothing. I can still take my meds and have no side effect		March 28, 2017	10
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	HIV Infection	I have been HIV Positve for about 32 years.  The last cocktail  I was taking for about 8 years was Epzicom and Combivir . A year ago I changed my regimen to Triumeq . Initially, the side effects I experienced were sleeplessness, nausea and stomach gas, these symptoms lasted for about 3 months. Due to the sleeplessness, started taking the medication in the mornings  instead of the evenings. The first positive thing I noticed was that my skin became more hydrated and I had less skin eruptions. After one year on the medication I feel very normal , I continue to workout 3 times a week and my energy level is high. My Viral Load remains undetectable and my CD4 went from 800 to 1,150 . I am very happy that I made the switch to Triumeq .	10	February 24, 2017	23
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	HIV Infection	I take truimeq  600mg/50mg/300mg just had test shows that back being detectable again. I don't understand why I take on time every night,  any ideas why. thanks	10	February 19, 2017	5
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	HIV Infection	Diagnosed 5 years ago been on truvada and isentress with no problems at all!! Doctor wanted to switch me to this because it's a lot easier (1 pill once a day). Been on this for the past week and have had horrible side effects. Dizzy, no sleep, nauseous, and body/ joint pain. Switching back to my old medication tomorrow. Goodbye triumeq!!!	3	February 11, 2017	6
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	HIV Infection	My physician put me on Triumeq about 12 months ago.  I had been on other anti-viral medications that were not effective in controlling viral load, and CD 4 counts.  I began taking Triumeq and no side effects whatsoever, with the exception of mild fatique.  I also have type 2 diabetes & cardio vascular disease.  I am 65 years old, and enjoy a healthy life style, thanks to this medication.  I strongly urge anyone to discuss this option with their health professional.	10	February 9, 2017	5
Abaloparatide	Osteoporosis	I've been on Tymlos for 15 months now.  Broke 3 bones in a year after being on Actonel for over 10 years for Osteoperosis.  Recent bone density shows 18% improvement in my hip but lately been having lots of back pain. Doc said it's arthritis but it's been much worse in the last few months and I'm wondering if it's from Tymlos.  Doc wants me to continue for another year but I'm concerned.  Initially had nausea when I started and I can feel my bones being sore too.  Anyone else experience symptoms this far into treatment?	8	April 27, 2021	1
Abaloparatide	Osteoporosis	I am just now starting my 4th month.  I don’t have any serious side effects; however I was already being treated for heart palpitations so that may be why!  I do get tired during the day.  Sometimes I feel like I can ‘feel my bones’.  My problems areas include my spine -4.7 and my hip.  I plan to have a bone scan after 6 months to see if there’s been progress.  If not, I’ll need to make a decision of whether or not to continue.  I takes my injections in the morning.	7	April 19, 2021	1
Abaloparatide	Osteoporosis	I am just about finished with my second pen.  I switched to injecting at bed time because of side effects and that has worked well.  I do get the dizziness and palpitations. During the day I do experience fatigue and brain fog but seems to be lessening.  I have fractured 3 vertebrae and have a score of -4.3 in my spine so I am planning on staying on it.	9	April 10, 2021	4
Abaloparatide	Osteoporosis	I’ve been on Tymlos for a month now. My problem is itching. I can hardly sleep at night the itching is so bad. Not sure if I will continue. Does anyone else have this problem.	4	March 25, 2021	0
Abaloparatide	Osteoporosis	Take it at night, have slight headache and pressure behind my ears, but not horrible.  I have ‘ill feeling’ after injection, but I go to sleep fairly quickly after.   Palpitations are there, but it calms down after a while.  I am on my first pen about 2 Weeks in.  So far, tolerable.   However, I am very interested in why the Tymlos hasn’t had more facts available to the public.   Why does it cause the pain in the bones ( I am guessing it’s caused from bone growth.)		March 15, 2021	3
Abaloparatide	Osteoporosis	Christmas Eve 2019 bent over and picked up a box. Fractured L4 and collapsed spine. Did a bone density test  in January to find a -3.8!  Definitely severe osteoporosis. Started tymlos in February. Been on it for almost a year. Did another bone density test to see if working. So grateful and thankful it’s now at -2.7. I’m still on it for another year and I know it’ll get even better!  It works. Of course had side effects, headache and raced heart but used to it. Sometime still effects but not always. Only downside but it has worked!	9	February 23, 2021	8
Abaloparatide	Osteoporosis	I was on Tymlos for about 5 weeks — I gave it a good try. I had to inject at night before bed because of the palpitations and nausea — but then I dreaded going to bed. The main symptom that has bothered me so much and still is after being off it for a week is bone pain, which I did not have before. It wakes me up at night. I hope it goes away. I’ll be starting Prolia soon and hope to have fewer side effects.	2	February 2, 2021	8
Abaloparatide	Osteoporosis	OMG . This drug Tymlos did a number on me. I have been off it over a week because I woke up after two weeks of vertigo and fatigue and cloudy urine and feeling just horrible with a trigger finger on my left thumb. Then the pain went up my arm to my shoulder and I couldn't lift my arm, then it went to both arms. Two weeks after I have stopped I am still waking up with a severe trigger finger. The pain is crazy in the mornings. Of course the doctor and the nurse who helped me said they had never heard of this side effect. I hope this is not permanent. But if it continues I will be doing a lot more investigation into any one else getting these crazy side effects.	1	January 27, 2021	9
Abaloparatide	Osteoporosis	I had steadily, rapidly, worsening osteoporosis. Could not tolerate bisphosphonates and they did not give me any improvement. Did the full 18 months on Tymlos. I had occasional headaches and low BP but no big deal. The BMD I just had after therapy was done was great-overall 11% improvement. My lumbar especially-went from  -3.0 to  -2.1.  The injections were a drag but it was definitely worth it.	9	January 15, 2021	18
Abaloparatide	Osteoporosis	I started Tymlos 1 month the ago. I do have some palpitations but goes away after half hour. I inject before I go to sleep so I just lie down after taking it. Hopefully, this will help my bones. I plan to stay on it for 1 year. Then get a new Dexa to check my T score.		January 13, 2021	5
Abaloparatide	Osteoporosis	I had a hysterectomy at age 27, unable tolerate hormones  later was unable to tolerate osteoporosis medications tried several. Have been on Tymlos 7 months only side effect is the fatigue, but I can get through that. Hoping that this helps as the cost is going to keep me from staying on it. I am 69 my hip score was -3.5	5	January 8, 2021	6
Abaloparatide	Osteoporosis	Just started second Tymlos pen for osteoporosis. Side effects after injection (which start 15 min or so after) lasted 3.5-4.0 hours initially, down to 15-20 minutes now.  Initial side effects: “Drugged like feeling” (lightheaded, dizzy, brain fog, out of it) Fatigue Heart pounding   Other side effects that linger daily:  Initial severe bone pain which has slowly decreased.  Vertigo which is still present  Fatigue  Weight gain  Brain fog.   Due to my career and safety role, I have been out of work on std, due to the above side effects. As they are lessening, they are still present which may cause me to end use of this drug.	2	January 1, 2021	6
Abaloparatide	Osteoporosis	I wanted to update my experience.  Now after having been on Tymlos for 2 weeks, I am happy to report the side effects disappeared after the first week.  I also injected on alternate days for the 1st week which helped a lot. Injecting before bed was a big mistake for an insomniac like me. Just made me focus on my elevated pulse. I find injecting just before I exercise to works great.	9	December 21, 2020	13
Abaloparatide	Osteoporosis	Tymlos is the worst drug ever. Took it for a little over 2 months.  Extreme nausea almost immediately every day. Migraine every day.  Daily between 3 and 4PM every joint ached so bad I had to lay down.  Constantly felt like I had the flu. Or like I was on chemo. I have been off of it for over 2 months yet still have symptoms which I didn't have before taking it.  I am afraid permanent damage has been done.  Going to try a tablet next. This medication should be taken off the market.  Oh wait, big pharma doesn't care about you its all about that dollar.	1	December 3, 2020	11
Abaloparatide	Osteoporosis	My first week on Tymlos was excruciating! About five minutes after taking the injection I had heart palpitations, a severe headache, my teeth hurt so bad and then the lower back spasms started and I cried out in pain. It was horrible. I called my prescribing doctor after the first couple of days and she said that she had never heard of anyone having the side effects I described. They made me feel like I was crazy for saying that it was so horrible. I have now suffered through a little over a month of this drug. Although not so intense I still have heart palpitations and now severe thigh and feet cramps. I feel terrible and don't know how much more of this I can take. I am 59 years old and I work full time and am a very busy person and this has made my quality of life very bad. I hope it is worth it!	3	November 30, 2020	14
Abaloparatide	Osteoporosis	Six Tymlos injections so far at half dose (4 clicks).  First day side effects were just feeling odd.  Trouble sleeping on night 2.  With the first few injections, there were hot flashes, shocks, and pains that quickly moved around my body.  Also headaches that lasted about 20 hours and muscle pains as if I'd been in a car accident.  I wondered if the benefits could outweigh the sense that my body was being poisoned.  After the fourth dose, things started calming down some.  The most persistent effect is a tolerable pain in my lower left back that began with the first injection and hasn't gone away yet.  I was told to ramp up the dose from half (4 clicks) to 5 clicks on the 5th night.  Not wanting more bad side effects, I have put that off.  The PA who prescribed indicated that some people can't tolerate going up from a half dose.  If that's me, I wonder, will half a dose do any good for my bones?  Or will I inject myself and go through side effects for 2 years for no benefit?	4	November 22, 2020	6
Abaloparatide	Osteoporosis	I was apprehensive about taking this Tymlos injection because I’m always sensitive to medications. I took the shot Thursday night at 915 immediately had lightheadedness and fatigue heart palpitations. The heart palpitations went away lightheadedness and fatigue stayed. I went to bed at 11pm , was awakened by horrible reflux at 3am. Fell back to sleep was awakened at 5am severe pain in my entire head, teeth, gums, etc. sat up to get Tylenol and was totally blind in my left eye. I woke my husband he took me to emergency room. Spent 7 hours being tested , 2 CT Scans, expert eye examinations, neurological testing, blood tests all normal tests. I try never to take pain medication because it makes me nauseous but they said it would be baby does. Ok . Well wound up dry heaving for 3 hrs. Finally released went home. Once pain meds wore off, pain in head started again. I took 2 gabapentin s, 2 Xanax and slept all night. I woke up Saturday morning same pain in head, the pain jumps all around .	1	November 7, 2020	16
Abaloparatide	Osteoporosis	This medicine gave me horrible side effects, high blood pressure, heart palpitations after the 1st dose. Felt like a sword going through my back radiating through my body. I'm 28 hours into it and will never do it again. I asked about heart palpitations and blood pressure and was told they were not in the side effects.	1	October 13, 2020	0
Abaloparatide	Osteoporosis	I used Tymlos for 3 months initially.  Prior to my first injection, my blood pressure was perfect. After the injection, my BP would climb to 185-195/90-95 and the heart palpitations would start.  At night, insomnia and leg cramps would arrive. My doctor took me off for one month - no heart palpitations, no insomnia, no leg cramps and blood pressure back to 115/65. My doctor asked me to start again. This time it was worse. BP even higher and heart palpitations more pronounced - extreme chest pains, as well. The leg cramps were brutal and my achilles tendon in my left leg started hurting and burning. Eight years ago I ruptured it in TRX as a result of being on Levaquin. For seven years I have had no pain, no issues whatsoever in exercising until I restarted the Tymlos.  I just went in for an MRI, the Achilles repair is intact - however, I now have damage just above - the tendon has thinned and I am on severe restrictions to avoid another rupture.  I am off of Tymlos.	1	September 25, 2020	34
Abaloparatide	Osteoporosis	Tymlos Is effective because my numbers on spine getting down little but side effects are strong , like : vertigo and heart palpitations are very strong and I feel very weak next day after injection.	5	September 4, 2020	22
Abaloparatide	Osteoporosis	I am 77 and my bone results just get worse each time.First injection of Tymlos on 7-23-20. Two hours later, a low grade fever. Next night, the same thing. Third night, didn't inject and no fever. I cannot take this drug and told my doctor that.	1	August 6, 2020	24
Abaloparatide	Osteoporosis	Did not do well on tymlos. High 24 hr. urine ca. scores - hypercalcinuria. Started tymlos June 2019; stopped April 11 2020. Other issues: cramps in legs, mental fog starting second month,  joint pain in hands, tiredness on a daily basis. Got new rheumatologist; second opinion. Started prolia today. Should have monitored bone markers more carefully both before and during treatment of tymlos. Now I know. New doc. will do blood tests and urine every 3 months. tymlos not for me.	5	August 4, 2020	23
Abaloparatide	Osteoporosis	I have had osteoporosis for many years due to having a complete hysterectomy at age 29 I was on pills it had to be taken off because of it loosening my teeth I lost many teeth. I have been on this medication since approximately November of 2019 I have read all of your side effects it is so hard for me to give you my opinion since I have other conditions like bulging disc scoliosis arthritis. Can tell you that I have had a lot of itching in the palms of my hands and the bottom of my feet I have had cramping in my toes and arch of my foot. It's hard to say about my back since I have back problems and I have had insomnia for many years now so I cannot say that this medication has caused those two problems I have been getting headaches more recently but again I have problems with discs in my neck as well all from a motorcycle accident. I am willing to try this medication to see if there is any Improvement.	7	August 2, 2020	13
Abaloparatide	Osteoporosis	I have had 5 compression fractures.  And 1 broken rib since as 51 I'm now 55. My osteoporosis is from prednisone!  I was tall at 5.9 now I am 5.4 and my organs are being crushed. I have a hunch back from repeated compression fractures. My neck is like 4 inches forward. I've lost most of my mobility. Can barely get out of chair or bed. I can't garden anymore or do chores. No choice but to take big pharma poisons again. Taking Tymlos for 5 days now. Was no side effects until night 4. So I am taking it at night. I actually inject into fatty part of my thigh. So day 4. Could not sleep a wink. Heart racing, neuropathy whole body, stomach pains, gas, heartburn, dizzy, leg pain. Oh joy now this for 18 months. It better grow bone.  I've read if you get a compression fracture get a kyphoplasty! To stabilize the fracture regain vertebral height and get out of pain and no hunch back! The medical field and big pharma aren't here to help. Just now live in a nightmare that I can not awake from.	6	July 27, 2020	26
Abaloparatide	Osteoporosis	After the 1st injection I had back and leg pain, headache, and heart pounding.  The headache lasted about 20 hours  along with an ill feeling.  The next 2 injections the back and leg pain were much less, but still the headache and slightly ill feeling.  Now 8 days in, just slight pain and occasional heart pounding, but only for a short period of time.		July 1, 2020	26
Abaloparatide	Osteoporosis	After 6 months on Tymlos, the ONLY side effects I've noticed are occasional heart palpitations that go away in minutes.	8	June 29, 2020	34
Abaloparatide	Osteoporosis	On Tymlos for 3 months , severe insomnia.	6	June 28, 2020	19
Abaloparatide	Osteoporosis	Hi..reviewed this drug 3 weeks ago. I've been on tymlos only 1 month. I had spinal fracture in the past also multiple other fractures from falling from standing position. Anyway I have back pain from fractures but the back pain on tymlos was so severe I have stopped it.  I had headache after injection just take tylenol.  Fatigue another problem and nausea.  I took zofran.  i will ask dr to try prolia. Oh I am 69 diagnosed at 50 with osteoporosis but was always afraid of side effects..good luck..	3	June 15, 2020	20
Abaloparatide	Osteoporosis	Tymlos for 2 months my side effect were fatigue, constant nausea, finally had to stop. I felt like I was poisoned. A year later and I am having significant leg pain	2	June 15, 2020	19
Abaloparatide	Osteoporosis	I just took my first injections and had intense lower back pain like a spasm; it took my breath. My dr said was not associated with med.  The next night wasn’t so intense and lasted shorter period. Slight headache also. The list of side effects doesn’t mention intense back pain.   My dr strongly suggested I continue to see if side effects go away or become tolerable. Any one else experience this?		June 12, 2020	31
Abaloparatide	Osteoporosis	I used Tymlos for approximately four months after the first  month-and-a-half two months I started having leg and back pain really bad. The nurse practitioner talked me into keep taking it so I took it another month and a half. Then I was hurting so bad I had to go to the emergency room. I started growing bone in my legs, so it was like growing pains. This is what they told me but it hurts so bad that I quit I couldn't take it any longer that was the only side effect I had but I couldn't couldn't stand it as up every night	1	June 2, 2020	28
Abaloparatide	Osteoporosis	On Tymlos for 1 month. Won’t make 2 years on this med. Probably only another month then switching to Prolia even though I know it doesn’t build bone. With Tymlos the constant headache, palpitations, nausea are very unsettling. However the bone/muscle pains the last few days have been the last straw. Can’t sleep. Can’t get comfortable.	4	May 5, 2020	18
Abaloparatide	Osteoporosis	I had Tymlos and got side effects of an instant headache, racing of heart and spinning. Headache is a pressure headache and it lasts for hours. This is day in and day out.  I have been on Tymlos for 4 weeks and it’s just the same thing every night. I can’t sleep. I tried it this morning to see if it makes a difference and it ruined my day. I am having surgery on my back in 3 months so it’s essential... but I don’t know if I can take it much longer. It’s wrecking my quality of life.	4	April 9, 2020	29
Abaloparatide	Osteoporosis	I take my Tymols shot  every morning and about 10 minutes after I always get a slight headache lasts about an hour. but, has anyone else had severe leg and feet cramps. They are so bad I am out of bed 4 or 5 times a night.	4	April 8, 2020	25
Abaloparatide	Osteoporosis	I started Tymlos 3/12/20 and decided to discontinue it due to heart palpitations and anxiety.  I also had terrible insomnia with it.  I took the injection at night before bed but when I tried taking the injection in the morning I would have to lie down because it made me so tired (go figure).  With all of the Covid 19 worries I sure don't need my heart racing anymore than it already is.  Also the black box warning of Osteosarcoma worries me a lot frankly.	1	April 6, 2020	28
Abaloparatide	Osteoporosis	So I have been on Tymlos and  I agree to others commenting on the severe back pain!  But why?  I haven’t found an answer. Also extreme dizziness.  Like nothing I have experienced.  All the time not just after the shot.  I’m been taking it for 5 months. Not sure I can do it for the 2 years the dr wants me to.	3	March 19, 2020	28
Abaloparatide	Osteoporosis	I have been using Tymlos 2 months at this time,  and causes side effects of severe nausea .	6	March 17, 2020	22
Abaloparatide	Osteoporosis	I have been on Tymlos for a month and a half. The only side effect I’ve noticed is that after some injections my heart races for a bit. Not every time. Sometimes upper stomach pain but rarely. I really hope it makes my bones stronger. I’m willing to stay with this the eighteen months if it builds my bones.	8	February 28, 2020	31
Abaloparatide	Osteoporosis	I found out I had a t score of 3.5 at age 55. They told me I have osteoporosis in my spine. I’ve been using Tymlos for almost two months. The first time I used it I had what other mentioned  pain in the back. It was very intense. I tried it the following day and it didn’t cause the same pain. Each day following was fine. I have minor back pain after each injection but use a heating pad to relax it. It is bearable.  I’ve heard such good results so I’m looking forward to having a bone density scan after 18 months that I’m suppose to be on it.		February 2, 2020	30
Abaloparatide	Osteoporosis	Have been on Tymlos 2 weeks. Will the back pain and palpitations   subside  after being on drug for a while.	3	January 24, 2020	13
Abaloparatide	Osteoporosis	I did my first Tymlos injection in the evening before bedtime.   Within minutes I had unbearable excruciating lower back pain.  So extreme that I sat down in a chair screaming in pain.  My partner had to call 911.  I was taken to the hospital where I was monitored for several hours until the pain went away.   I normally have low blood pressure.  Upon arrival in the ER it was extremely high. Dangerously so from the pain the drug caused me to have.   I would never do that again.    My prescribing doctor insisted that I must have injured my lower back simultaneously.  I certainly did not.  It was the Tymlos that caused the problem.   The attending ER doctor advised me to never try that drug again as I had a severe allergic reaction to it.   Would mention here that I have no other known allergies.	1	January 22, 2020	42
Abaloparatide	Osteoporosis	I've been on  Tymlos for 2 days, have side effects of severe pain in my back radiating  up my back and heart palpitations  and head hurting bad it lasts for 1 hour.	1	January 22, 2020	27
Abaloparatide	Osteoporosis	I am 72 in an osteopenia stage and had multiple fractures.  Forteo gave me too many side effects.  Therefore, I have been taking Tymlos for 10 months.  Compared to Forteo, Tymlos has been tolerable.  The only negatives have been my high calcium score and joint stiffness.  Because of the high calcium, my dosage has been reduced to 40 mcg every other day.  Has anyone experienced this crippling stiffness?		November 1, 2019	34
Abaloparatide	Osteoporosis	Suffered severe tachycardia less than 15 minutes after the abaloparatide injection. Took an hour for heart rate to go down. Experience palpitations for 48 hours, dizziness and incredible sleepiness.	1	October 22, 2019	3
Abaloparatide	Osteoporosis	I experienced severe headaches 3-4 hours after each injection which actually woke me up every night. I also experienced upper abdominal pain. AND, after taking Tymlos for 1 month, my hair started falling out.  I'm still trying to convince my doctor that I experienced all of these side effects.  Especially since he wants me to switch to Forteo which has even MORE side effects.	3	October 2, 2019	29
Abaloparatide	Osteoporosis	I injected this drug Tymlos daily for 18 months. I had a bone density scan done within two weeks of starting and 6 weeks after end of treatment. My later scan showed only a very slight improvement in my lower spine and my scores were worse in my hip .  I’m so disappointed that I did not have significant improvement in my osteoporosis especially since the treatment was so uncomfortable and so expensive. I just hope that I don’t develop cancer or kidney problems from using this drug.	2	September 12, 2019	53
Abaloparatide	Osteoporosis	Started after multiple spinal fractures- helped with bone building and pain - definitely a God send - only side effect is itching - I can deal with that	10	June 16, 2019	44
Abaloparatide	Osteoporosis	Severe back pain,  like almost unbearable at times.	2	May 28, 2019	37
Abaloparatide	Osteoporosis	This is my Tymlos review after trying it. You might want to know what are the side effects of Tymlos? For me I had leg pain, stomach cramps, headache, body pains		May 3, 2019	70
Abaloparatide	Osteoporosis	This prescription has made me very tired.  All I wanted to do is sleep it has also caused wheezing when I was on for 3 days in a row  then off every other day the wheezing and breathing got better.  Then instructed to go back on every day  and by  day 3 wheezing coughing and shortness of breath   took myself off completely at day 3 and it's been 3 weeks and still tired and coughing with shortness of breath	1	March 12, 2018	11
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Osteoporosis	I've been on Tymlos for 15 months now.  Broke 3 bones in a year after being on Actonel for over 10 years for Osteoperosis.  Recent bone density shows 18% improvement in my hip but lately been having lots of back pain. Doc said it's arthritis but it's been much worse in the last few months and I'm wondering if it's from Tymlos.  Doc wants me to continue for another year but I'm concerned.  Initially had nausea when I started and I can feel my bones being sore too.  Anyone else experience symptoms this far into treatment?	8	April 27, 2021	1
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Osteoporosis	I am just now starting my 4th month.  I don’t have any serious side effects; however I was already being treated for heart palpitations so that may be why!  I do get tired during the day.  Sometimes I feel like I can ‘feel my bones’.  My problems areas include my spine -4.7 and my hip.  I plan to have a bone scan after 6 months to see if there’s been progress.  If not, I’ll need to make a decision of whether or not to continue.  I takes my injections in the morning.	7	April 19, 2021	1
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Osteoporosis	I am just about finished with my second pen.  I switched to injecting at bed time because of side effects and that has worked well.  I do get the dizziness and palpitations. During the day I do experience fatigue and brain fog but seems to be lessening.  I have fractured 3 vertebrae and have a score of -4.3 in my spine so I am planning on staying on it.	9	April 10, 2021	4
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Osteoporosis	I’ve been on Tymlos for a month now. My problem is itching. I can hardly sleep at night the itching is so bad. Not sure if I will continue. Does anyone else have this problem.	4	March 25, 2021	0
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Osteoporosis	Take it at night, have slight headache and pressure behind my ears, but not horrible.  I have ‘ill feeling’ after injection, but I go to sleep fairly quickly after.   Palpitations are there, but it calms down after a while.  I am on my first pen about 2 Weeks in.  So far, tolerable.   However, I am very interested in why the Tymlos hasn’t had more facts available to the public.   Why does it cause the pain in the bones ( I am guessing it’s caused from bone growth.)

Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Osteoporosis	Christmas Eve 2019 bent over and picked up a box. Fractured L4 and collapsed spine. Did a bone density test  in January to find a -3.8!  Definitely severe osteoporosis. Started tymlos in February. Been on it for almost a year. Did another bone density test to see if working. So grateful and thankful it’s now at -2.7. I’m still on it for another year and I know it’ll get even better!  It works. Of course had side effects, headache and raced heart but used to it. Sometime still effects but not always. Only downside but it has worked!	9	February 23, 2021	8
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Osteoporosis	I was on Tymlos for about 5 weeks — I gave it a good try. I had to inject at night before bed because of the palpitations and nausea — but then I dreaded going to bed. The main symptom that has bothered me so much and still is after being off it for a week is bone pain, which I did not have before. It wakes me up at night. I hope it goes away. I’ll be starting Prolia soon and hope to have fewer side effects.	2	February 2, 2021	8
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Osteoporosis	OMG . This drug Tymlos did a number on me. I have been off it over a week because I woke up after two weeks of vertigo and fatigue and cloudy urine and feeling just horrible with a trigger finger on my left thumb. Then the pain went up my arm to my shoulder and I couldn't lift my arm, then it went to both arms. Two weeks after I have stopped I am still waking up with a severe trigger finger. The pain is crazy in the mornings. Of course the doctor and the nurse who helped me said they had never heard of this side effect. I hope this is not permanent. But if it continues I will be doing a lot more investigation into any one else getting these crazy side effects.	1	January 27, 2021	9
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Osteoporosis	I had steadily, rapidly, worsening osteoporosis. Could not tolerate bisphosphonates and they did not give me any improvement. Did the full 18 months on Tymlos. I had occasional headaches and low BP but no big deal. The BMD I just had after therapy was done was great-overall 11% improvement. My lumbar especially-went from  -3.0 to  -2.1.  The injections were a drag but it was definitely worth it.	9	January 15, 2021	18
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Osteoporosis	I started Tymlos 1 month the ago. I do have some palpitations but goes away after half hour. I inject before I go to sleep so I just lie down after taking it. Hopefully, this will help my bones. I plan to stay on it for 1 year. Then get a new Dexa to check my T score.		January 13, 2021	5
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Osteoporosis	I had a hysterectomy at age 27, unable tolerate hormones  later was unable to tolerate osteoporosis medications tried several. Have been on Tymlos 7 months only side effect is the fatigue, but I can get through that. Hoping that this helps as the cost is going to keep me from staying on it. I am 69 my hip score was -3.5	5	January 8, 2021	6
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Osteoporosis	Just started second Tymlos pen for osteoporosis. Side effects after injection (which start 15 min or so after) lasted 3.5-4.0 hours initially, down to 15-20 minutes now.  Initial side effects: “Drugged like feeling” (lightheaded, dizzy, brain fog, out of it) Fatigue Heart pounding   Other side effects that linger daily:  Initial severe bone pain which has slowly decreased.  Vertigo which is still present  Fatigue  Weight gain  Brain fog.   Due to my career and safety role, I have been out of work on std, due to the above side effects. As they are lessening, they are still present which may cause me to end use of this drug.	2	January 1, 2021	6
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Osteoporosis	I wanted to update my experience.  Now after having been on Tymlos for 2 weeks, I am happy to report the side effects disappeared after the first week.  I also injected on alternate days for the 1st week which helped a lot. Injecting before bed was a big mistake for an insomniac like me. Just made me focus on my elevated pulse. I find injecting just before I exercise to works great.	9	December 21, 2020	13
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Osteoporosis	Tymlos is the worst drug ever. Took it for a little over 2 months.  Extreme nausea almost immediately every day. Migraine every day.  Daily between 3 and 4PM every joint ached so bad I had to lay down.  Constantly felt like I had the flu. Or like I was on chemo. I have been off of it for over 2 months yet still have symptoms which I didn't have before taking it.  I am afraid permanent damage has been done.  Going to try a tablet next. This medication should be taken off the market.  Oh wait, big pharma doesn't care about you its all about that dollar.	1	December 3, 2020	11
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Osteoporosis	My first week on Tymlos was excruciating! About five minutes after taking the injection I had heart palpitations, a severe headache, my teeth hurt so bad and then the lower back spasms started and I cried out in pain. It was horrible. I called my prescribing doctor after the first couple of days and she said that she had never heard of anyone having the side effects I described. They made me feel like I was crazy for saying that it was so horrible. I have now suffered through a little over a month of this drug. Although not so intense I still have heart palpitations and now severe thigh and feet cramps. I feel terrible and don't know how much more of this I can take. I am 59 years old and I work full time and am a very busy person and this has made my quality of life very bad. I hope it is worth it!	3	November 30, 2020	14
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Osteoporosis	Six Tymlos injections so far at half dose (4 clicks).  First day side effects were just feeling odd.  Trouble sleeping on night 2.  With the first few injections, there were hot flashes, shocks, and pains that quickly moved around my body.  Also headaches that lasted about 20 hours and muscle pains as if I'd been in a car accident.  I wondered if the benefits could outweigh the sense that my body was being poisoned.  After the fourth dose, things started calming down some.  The most persistent effect is a tolerable pain in my lower left back that began with the first injection and hasn't gone away yet.  I was told to ramp up the dose from half (4 clicks) to 5 clicks on the 5th night.  Not wanting more bad side effects, I have put that off.  The PA who prescribed indicated that some people can't tolerate going up from a half dose.  If that's me, I wonder, will half a dose do any good for my bones?  Or will I inject myself and go through side effects for 2 years for no benefit?	4	November 22, 2020	6
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Osteoporosis	I was apprehensive about taking this Tymlos injection because I’m always sensitive to medications. I took the shot Thursday night at 915 immediately had lightheadedness and fatigue heart palpitations. The heart palpitations went away lightheadedness and fatigue stayed. I went to bed at 11pm , was awakened by horrible reflux at 3am. Fell back to sleep was awakened at 5am severe pain in my entire head, teeth, gums, etc. sat up to get Tylenol and was totally blind in my left eye. I woke my husband he took me to emergency room. Spent 7 hours being tested , 2 CT Scans, expert eye examinations, neurological testing, blood tests all normal tests. I try never to take pain medication because it makes me nauseous but they said it would be baby does. Ok . Well wound up dry heaving for 3 hrs. Finally released went home. Once pain meds wore off, pain in head started again. I took 2 gabapentin s, 2 Xanax and slept all night. I woke up Saturday morning same pain in head, the pain jumps all around .	1	November 7, 2020	16
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Osteoporosis	This medicine gave me horrible side effects, high blood pressure, heart palpitations after the 1st dose. Felt like a sword going through my back radiating through my body. I'm 28 hours into it and will never do it again. I asked about heart palpitations and blood pressure and was told they were not in the side effects.	1	October 13, 2020	0
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Osteoporosis	I used Tymlos for 3 months initially.  Prior to my first injection, my blood pressure was perfect. After the injection, my BP would climb to 185-195/90-95 and the heart palpitations would start.  At night, insomnia and leg cramps would arrive. My doctor took me off for one month - no heart palpitations, no insomnia, no leg cramps and blood pressure back to 115/65. My doctor asked me to start again. This time it was worse. BP even higher and heart palpitations more pronounced - extreme chest pains, as well. The leg cramps were brutal and my achilles tendon in my left leg started hurting and burning. Eight years ago I ruptured it in TRX as a result of being on Levaquin. For seven years I have had no pain, no issues whatsoever in exercising until I restarted the Tymlos.  I just went in for an MRI, the Achilles repair is intact - however, I now have damage just above - the tendon has thinned and I am on severe restrictions to avoid another rupture.  I am off of Tymlos.	1	September 25, 2020	34
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Osteoporosis	Tymlos Is effective because my numbers on spine getting down little but side effects are strong , like : vertigo and heart palpitations are very strong and I feel very weak next day after injection.	5	September 4, 2020	22
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Osteoporosis	I am 77 and my bone results just get worse each time.First injection of Tymlos on 7-23-20. Two hours later, a low grade fever. Next night, the same thing. Third night, didn't inject and no fever. I cannot take this drug and told my doctor that.	1	August 6, 2020	24
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Osteoporosis	Did not do well on tymlos. High 24 hr. urine ca. scores - hypercalcinuria. Started tymlos June 2019; stopped April 11 2020. Other issues: cramps in legs, mental fog starting second month,  joint pain in hands, tiredness on a daily basis. Got new rheumatologist; second opinion. Started prolia today. Should have monitored bone markers more carefully both before and during treatment of tymlos. Now I know. New doc. will do blood tests and urine every 3 months. tymlos not for me.	5	August 4, 2020	23
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Osteoporosis	I have had osteoporosis for many years due to having a complete hysterectomy at age 29 I was on pills it had to be taken off because of it loosening my teeth I lost many teeth. I have been on this medication since approximately November of 2019 I have read all of your side effects it is so hard for me to give you my opinion since I have other conditions like bulging disc scoliosis arthritis. Can tell you that I have had a lot of itching in the palms of my hands and the bottom of my feet I have had cramping in my toes and arch of my foot. It's hard to say about my back since I have back problems and I have had insomnia for many years now so I cannot say that this medication has caused those two problems I have been getting headaches more recently but again I have problems with discs in my neck as well all from a motorcycle accident. I am willing to try this medication to see if there is any Improvement.	7	August 2, 2020	13
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Osteoporosis	I have had 5 compression fractures.  And 1 broken rib since as 51 I'm now 55. My osteoporosis is from prednisone!  I was tall at 5.9 now I am 5.4 and my organs are being crushed. I have a hunch back from repeated compression fractures. My neck is like 4 inches forward. I've lost most of my mobility. Can barely get out of chair or bed. I can't garden anymore or do chores. No choice but to take big pharma poisons again. Taking Tymlos for 5 days now. Was no side effects until night 4. So I am taking it at night. I actually inject into fatty part of my thigh. So day 4. Could not sleep a wink. Heart racing, neuropathy whole body, stomach pains, gas, heartburn, dizzy, leg pain. Oh joy now this for 18 months. It better grow bone.  I've read if you get a compression fracture get a kyphoplasty! To stabilize the fracture regain vertebral height and get out of pain and no hunch back! The medical field and big pharma aren't here to help. Just now live in a nightmare that I can not awake from.	6	July 27, 2020	26
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Osteoporosis	After the 1st injection I had back and leg pain, headache, and heart pounding.  The headache lasted about 20 hours  along with an ill feeling.  The next 2 injections the back and leg pain were much less, but still the headache and slightly ill feeling.  Now 8 days in, just slight pain and occasional heart pounding, but only for a short period of time.		July 1, 2020	26
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Osteoporosis	After 6 months on Tymlos, the ONLY side effects I've noticed are occasional heart palpitations that go away in minutes.	8	June 29, 2020	34

Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Osteoporosis	Hi..reviewed this drug 3 weeks ago. I've been on tymlos only 1 month. I had spinal fracture in the past also multiple other fractures from falling from standing position. Anyway I have back pain from fractures but the back pain on tymlos was so severe I have stopped it.  I had headache after injection just take tylenol.  Fatigue another problem and nausea.  I took zofran.  i will ask dr to try prolia. Oh I am 69 diagnosed at 50 with osteoporosis but was always afraid of side effects..good luck..	3	June 15, 2020	20
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Osteoporosis	Tymlos for 2 months my side effect were fatigue, constant nausea, finally had to stop. I felt like I was poisoned. A year later and I am having significant leg pain	2	June 15, 2020	19
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Osteoporosis	I just took my first injections and had intense lower back pain like a spasm; it took my breath. My dr said was not associated with med.  The next night wasn’t so intense and lasted shorter period. Slight headache also. The list of side effects doesn’t mention intense back pain.   My dr strongly suggested I continue to see if side effects go away or become tolerable. Any one else experience this?		June 12, 2020	31
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Osteoporosis	I used Tymlos for approximately four months after the first  month-and-a-half two months I started having leg and back pain really bad. The nurse practitioner talked me into keep taking it so I took it another month and a half. Then I was hurting so bad I had to go to the emergency room. I started growing bone in my legs, so it was like growing pains. This is what they told me but it hurts so bad that I quit I couldn't take it any longer that was the only side effect I had but I couldn't couldn't stand it as up every night	1	June 2, 2020	28
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Osteoporosis	On Tymlos for 1 month. Won’t make 2 years on this med. Probably only another month then switching to Prolia even though I know it doesn’t build bone. With Tymlos the constant headache, palpitations, nausea are very unsettling. However the bone/muscle pains the last few days have been the last straw. Can’t sleep. Can’t get comfortable.	4	May 5, 2020	18
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Osteoporosis	I had Tymlos and got side effects of an instant headache, racing of heart and spinning. Headache is a pressure headache and it lasts for hours. This is day in and day out.  I have been on Tymlos for 4 weeks and it’s just the same thing every night. I can’t sleep. I tried it this morning to see if it makes a difference and it ruined my day. I am having surgery on my back in 3 months so it’s essential... but I don’t know if I can take it much longer. It’s wrecking my quality of life.	4	April 9, 2020	29
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Osteoporosis	I take my Tymols shot  every morning and about 10 minutes after I always get a slight headache lasts about an hour. but, has anyone else had severe leg and feet cramps. They are so bad I am out of bed 4 or 5 times a night.	4	April 8, 2020	25
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Osteoporosis	I started Tymlos 3/12/20 and decided to discontinue it due to heart palpitations and anxiety.  I also had terrible insomnia with it.  I took the injection at night before bed but when I tried taking the injection in the morning I would have to lie down because it made me so tired (go figure).  With all of the Covid 19 worries I sure don't need my heart racing anymore than it already is.  Also the black box warning of Osteosarcoma worries me a lot frankly.	1	April 6, 2020	28
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Osteoporosis	So I have been on Tymlos and  I agree to others commenting on the severe back pain!  But why?  I haven’t found an answer. Also extreme dizziness.  Like nothing I have experienced.  All the time not just after the shot.  I’m been taking it for 5 months. Not sure I can do it for the 2 years the dr wants me to.	3	March 19, 2020	28
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Osteoporosis	I have been using Tymlos 2 months at this time,  and causes side effects of severe nausea .	6	March 17, 2020	22
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Osteoporosis	I have been on Tymlos for a month and a half. The only side effect I’ve noticed is that after some injections my heart races for a bit. Not every time. Sometimes upper stomach pain but rarely. I really hope it makes my bones stronger. I’m willing to stay with this the eighteen months if it builds my bones.	8	February 28, 2020	31
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Osteoporosis	I found out I had a t score of 3.5 at age 55. They told me I have osteoporosis in my spine. I’ve been using Tymlos for almost two months. The first time I used it I had what other mentioned  pain in the back. It was very intense. I tried it the following day and it didn’t cause the same pain. Each day following was fine. I have minor back pain after each injection but use a heating pad to relax it. It is bearable.  I’ve heard such good results so I’m looking forward to having a bone density scan after 18 months that I’m suppose to be on it.		February 2, 2020	30
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Osteoporosis	Have been on Tymlos 2 weeks. Will the back pain and palpitations   subside  after being on drug for a while.	3	January 24, 2020	13
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Osteoporosis	I did my first Tymlos injection in the evening before bedtime.   Within minutes I had unbearable excruciating lower back pain.  So extreme that I sat down in a chair screaming in pain.  My partner had to call 911.  I was taken to the hospital where I was monitored for several hours until the pain went away.   I normally have low blood pressure.  Upon arrival in the ER it was extremely high. Dangerously so from the pain the drug caused me to have.   I would never do that again.    My prescribing doctor insisted that I must have injured my lower back simultaneously.  I certainly did not.  It was the Tymlos that caused the problem.   The attending ER doctor advised me to never try that drug again as I had a severe allergic reaction to it.   Would mention here that I have no other known allergies.	1	January 22, 2020	42
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Osteoporosis	I've been on  Tymlos for 2 days, have side effects of severe pain in my back radiating  up my back and heart palpitations  and head hurting bad it lasts for 1 hour.	1	January 22, 2020	27
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Osteoporosis	I am 72 in an osteopenia stage and had multiple fractures.  Forteo gave me too many side effects.  Therefore, I have been taking Tymlos for 10 months.  Compared to Forteo, Tymlos has been tolerable.  The only negatives have been my high calcium score and joint stiffness.  Because of the high calcium, my dosage has been reduced to 40 mcg every other day.  Has anyone experienced this crippling stiffness?		November 1, 2019	34
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Osteoporosis	Suffered severe tachycardia less than 15 minutes after the abaloparatide injection. Took an hour for heart rate to go down. Experience palpitations for 48 hours, dizziness and incredible sleepiness.	1	October 22, 2019	3
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Osteoporosis	I experienced severe headaches 3-4 hours after each injection which actually woke me up every night. I also experienced upper abdominal pain. AND, after taking Tymlos for 1 month, my hair started falling out.  I'm still trying to convince my doctor that I experienced all of these side effects.  Especially since he wants me to switch to Forteo which has even MORE side effects.	3	October 2, 2019	29
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Osteoporosis	I injected this drug Tymlos daily for 18 months. I had a bone density scan done within two weeks of starting and 6 weeks after end of treatment. My later scan showed only a very slight improvement in my lower spine and my scores were worse in my hip .  I’m so disappointed that I did not have significant improvement in my osteoporosis especially since the treatment was so uncomfortable and so expensive. I just hope that I don’t develop cancer or kidney problems from using this drug.	2	September 12, 2019	53

Abemaciclib	Breast Cancer	Verzenio has worked after my wife’s initial treatment failed and  her cancer returned.    She had some initial diarrhea, but, our doctor adjusted dose and now all Is going good.	10	February 19, 2020	22
Abilify	Agitated State	I’ve been dealing with anger/mood issues. My psychiatrist put me on 5mg Abilify. I took it last night for the first time. I woke up puking, and having diarrhea. I have had a dizzy spell, if I get up. My heart will race. It was recommended to take before bedtime. But, I’ve been up all night. Wasn’t a pleasant experience.	2	April 9, 2021	4
Abilify	Agitated State	I take 2.5mg of Abilify.  Abilify is my miracle drug. I have struggled with anxiety my entire life, and have PTSD. I used to struggle with feeling rage, intrusive thoughts that I just couldn’t shake and general overwhelming  anxiety. Tried and quit at least ten other meds before finding this one.   I know it works because if I accidentally forget a dose one day my anxiety is back in full force for 2-3 days after. Once it’s back in my system I’m fine again.   I haven’t had any noticeable side effects. I take trazodone and melatonin for sleep so I have no problems sleeping, and I have been intentionally losing weight by counting calories with no problem.   I quit a different med that was making my hair thin before starting this, and my hair has all come back on Abilify.   I have a prescription for a benzo for anxiety as needed, but I don’t need it anymore.	10	February 11, 2021	9
Abilify	Agitated State	The side effects are bad at first - do not take Abilify at night! My feet were erratic starting out and I had a hard time sleeping because I took it at night. Another side effect: Weight gain does occur! But, this is not because the pill has calories (one review said) or because it gives you munchies (another review said). It simply changes the way your body stores leptin and processes food. Adding in slight exercise, or reducing your calories with healthier foods might help - or if you are lucky, it might not affect you at all. I did not notice the weight gain effects on the 5 mg, but I did on the 10 mg. I have gained three pounds in one week. Personally, the weight is not something I can handle, so I will be going back to 5 mg because that worked just fine for me.   It might take some experimenting but try it first (always start with a low dose).	7	February 5, 2021	5
Abilify	Agitated State	"My son was prescribed Abilify for ""aggressive"" behavior at age 6. It didn't really change his behavior. Within a year he began showing symptoms of ADHD, despite no signs before starting the med. Is the restlessness really ADHD, or is it akathisia caused by the med? He also became compulsive on Abilify, which I learned only recently is a known side-effect of the medication. His BMI is now borderline obese, and his metabolic labs are all elevated. I'm now tapering him off of it after more than 3 years. I've noticed a reduction in his compulsive and thrill seeking behavior, though he still can't sit still for the life of him. Hopefully those withdrawl side-effects will subside with time. If a doctor recommends your child take a mood-stabilizer, remember that a calm parent is the best mood-stabilizer for a child. This stuff isn't FDA approved for use in children for a reason. I'm not anti-medication and I'm sure this med works for some people, but this med did not work for him."	1	January 25, 2021	4
Abilify	Agitated State	I was put on this many years ago for a nervous breakdown and it started to help almost instantly. It was a good add on to my anti depressants at the time. I was literally only on it two weeks and doc decided I didn't need it anymore. It worked a lot better than any other things I've been on over the years. No side effects	8	January 15, 2021	8
Abilify	Agitated State	I was recently  prescribed  abilify (the generic) during  COVID. I have PTSD BPD and depression  so with  everything  going  on it has made me insane.  I had rage outbursts and would  want to hit people, not to mention the stress and lockdown.  Everytime  I left the house  there's signs and masks everywhere- anyways I needed a change.  I tried Abilify I'm on 5mg now, I found  it actually  increased my appetite,  I gained at least  10 lbs which  I'm not fond of, but I've been  eating  again.  I find it has worked great  as far as a mood stabilizer I've only had 1 panic attack since being on it. The first few weeks  I was really  agitated and paranoid  though. If I don't take it at the exact time everyday I feel  sick.  Overall it does help with my mood and rage so I'll stay on it. I don't like the always  having  to move,  its nice  at work  but not if I ever want to relax	7	December 1, 2020	10
Abilify	Agitated State	Honestly I feel horrible, even after 24 hrs of taking Abilify, I am a MESS, I can’t keep anything down, I feel sick. I feel like I should just run around to get rid of this horrible feeling. My ears are ringing. I can’t get rid of this weird muffled head feeling it’s a nasty drug. I just cannot relax. I’m more panicky and agitated than usual	1	September 8, 2020	22
Abilify	Agitated State	"Im going to keep it short & sweet. Before Abilify it was a lot of swearing and slammed doors, and irritation towards everyone. Abilify 5mg was prescribed about 2 months ago. Life now is more of a ""what was I mad about""? Great mood stabilizer. This medication has lifted me in so many ways.  Background: Bipolar, depression & anxiety..."	9	August 15, 2020	73
Abilify	Agitated State	My 9 year old son started Abilify a week ago. Prior to, he was diagnosed with Intermittent Explosive Disorder and possibly ADHD. He has struggled with intense burst of extreme anger. He would yell, scream, throw things, hit himself, slam doors etc. He would be angry very quickly over small things. He was very impulsive, and had many troubles at school focusing. We tried 2 different ADHD meds with no luck. They actually made things worse. His behaviour changed the moment he started Abilify, at a low dose of 2mg a day. We expected weeks until seeing results. My child is a completely different person. He is calm, polite, and so pleasant. He has voiced his own opinion on feeling this med is working. He can feel the difference within himself. He displays no side effects. He still feels and shows emotions, just in a calm manner. We have struggled heartbreakingly for a long time in finding him help, with nothing that has actually worked. This has absolutely changed his life.	9	August 6, 2020	59
Abilify	Agitated State	Been on Abilify 2mg for one week. Started Abilify to help with PTSD and Lupus. Periods of high anxiety causes my Lupus to flare. No anxiety = no Lupus. Anxiety is gone which is wonderful, but it's been replaced with nausea. It's not bad enough to cause vomiting, just annoying. I have no appetite and have lost 4 pounds so far. Some trouble sleeping. I take melatonin to help with that. I hope the nausea goes away. If it does, Abilify could be the one for me.	7	February 12, 2020	34
Abilify	Agitated State	My daughter is 9 and has been diagnosed with ADHD and ADD. She has mostly had issues with impulsiveness. She was in a constant state of anger and irritability. Previously she tried a stimulant medication which worked for awhile then became ineffective. She now takes Intuniv and Abilify. She has been on the Abilify for about 3 months and seems like a new child. She is happy, almost always in a good mood, and reacts appropriately instead of with anger. Hopefully the results will last. As of right now I am very excited about the results and the improvement of her mood and behavior.	8	October 31, 2019	37
Abilify	Agitated State	Ok my idiot shrink is being fired tomorrow. I've bee  reading up on this abilify stuff and guess what I have ADHD depression anxiety.  In menopause so what is he put me on Abilify this stuff makes me insanely psychotic and vicious.  The least little thing goes wrong and I'm screaming I mean literally screaming at the top of my lungs and freaking out. I will not take the stuff I am not bipolar I have other issues thank you very much it's terrible drug never again	1	July 28, 2019	27
Abilify	Agitated State	I have been taking abilify 1mg for almost 3 weeks now  for racing thoughts and I don't find the side effects are going away, I have terrible restless feeling, fast heartbeat, terrible cloudy head feeling and vomiting. I hate the side effects and think  I'm going to stop taking it. I am super sensitive to meds so I started at .5 and even then had the same thing, it sucks because it did help the racing thoughts but does nothing for my anxiety or depression disorder.	3	July 12, 2019	19
Abilify	Agitated State	On this drug I get anger and agitation. Going to go on something else instead can't bear it	1	June 9, 2019	21
Abilify	Agitated State	From the time my son could walk he was getting into trouble, he always had problematic tendencies, and very defiant. Everything I mean EVERYTHING was a fight. Life was a struggle. He started attending day care at 3.5years and ultimately got kicked out. He was put on blood pressure medicine at the age of 4, (hardly did anything.) ADHD medication; methanphetamine at age 5 (only worsened his symptoms.) resperidone at 6yrs, which took the edge off but he became more irritable only after 3mth. And Abilify age 7 and thus far his behavior, aggression, attention span has improved and everyone in the house hold and school does nothing but compliment how well mannered he is!!! (I never thought this day would come) yes he has gained weight but the benefits outweigh the side effects. I’m so grateful for this medication!!!!  Finding what works or doesn’t work has been a trial and error process, but in my mind ability is a miracle drug.	10	October 24, 2018	37
Abilify	Agitated State	I was started on this to try to help my misophonia (reaction to sounds such as dripping water, chewing, snapping gum or repetitive noises, such as pencil tapping) after Risperdal (made me feel like a zombie) and Seroquel (just knocked me out) didn't work, and I've actually been quite happy with the results.  I still get irritated by people chewing gum around me, but the Abilify helps me not to dwell on the thoughts and worries about the future that cause most of my anxiety. I can move on from a bad situation in less than a minute now, rather than dwelling on it for hours at a time and thinking myself into a deep dark hole.	7	February 1, 2018	27
Abilify	Agitated State	Gave me akathisia that still does not go away 8 days after quitting while it should. I need to be moving all the time (in a car or something like that counts ) and it's unbearable.	1	June 20, 2017	13
Abilify	Agitated State	My little brother was on this medicine for close to a week and half and the second he realized it wasn't helping him he stopped taking them and the life is sucked out of his body.  He has cold sweats and struggles to find a meaning for life.  Before he was happy and just had some major issues with our parents so the psychiatrist prescribed him this.    This is a bad  drug .  1 star.  Cry on your friend shoulders until your better but don't take this drug if I met the creator of this I would express to him/her how many lives he probably responsible for- it is a disgrace to society.		May 24, 2017	13
Abilify	Agitated State	Abilify made me extremely aggitated about the smallest things that wouldn't normally anger me. The time I was on it I am surprised I didn't end up in prison or a psych ward. One of the worst experiences of my life..   They must have had a good ad campaign for this drugs, because doctors seems to think it is the answer to everything. Fact is, the two trials done for the drug before it became the next coming of Jesus were done by the drug company who made it. Funny thing is, thy didn't hide in their trial that is caused agitation in a little less than half of their patients, which raises the question of why these companies even bother doin trials. They should just sell sugar pills, because it is clear that money was their only motivator...	1	March 13, 2017	24
Abilify	Autism	This really helped my rage/irritability but not possible to continue taking due to severe weight gain. I was put on it when I was 12 and it completely halted my metabolism. I was 75lbs when I started it and within 2 months I was 140lbs. I went from a double zero size to a size 13 in just 8 weeks. I no joke could gain weight from eating an apple. I have stretch marks and extra skin to this day (12 years later) from it. I got off it as soon as we switched drs (my dr at the time refused).	3	April 15, 2021	1
Abilify	Autism	This type of medication is not for autism. It was ok for a month whilst my son was distracted by the side effects. He then became more aggressive and argumentative and was hyperactive. He also developed OCD. Risperidone did not work either and he had tics on it.	1	March 26, 2021	2
Abilify	Autism	I take it with Lexapro, and it’s been amazing for my depression and irritability. I feel better than I have in years. The only side effects I don’t care for is the insomnia/waking up in the middle of the night.	7	February 11, 2021	4
Abilify	Autism	My son was prescribed Abilify years ago on a low dosage and it seemed to help him a lot. He had some weight gain but not much. As he got older and bigger he started having issues again and he was taken off Abilify and put on Risperidone. It was a complete disaster and things got bad really, really fast. Eventually he was put back on Abilify at a higher dosage and taken off Risperidone and things are much better. I recommend Abilify over Risperidone any day for autism.		December 31, 2020	16
Abilify	Autism	My daughter (13) was put on Abilify when she was 7 for aggression and severe behaviours. At first it seemed to help but after awhile she was just back to her usual severe behaviours. She use to be a tiny girl but she became over weight very quickly with this med. We had to put locks on the fridge and cupboards but then she literally ripped the doors off to get to the food!! Over the years we tried to wean her off several times but the side effects of weaning were terrible so every time we would put her back on. This time we have been weaning her off very very slowly over several months now, weaning down 2.5 mgs a month and it’s been much easier on her system. We have noticed a dramatic change in her seizures and she hasn’t had one in months now. We haven’t seen any changes in her behaviours, she isn't any worse, the same today on 2.5 mgs as she was when she was on 20mgs. So we really don’t think it was doing anything for her.	1	October 2, 2020	20
Abilify	Autism	15 year old son was prescribed Abilify for anxiety and aggression that started recently. It stopped the aggression and regulated his sleep cycle nicely. However, after 5 months, he started having crying episodes and seemed depressed mixed with mood swings.  Side effects included drooling and feeling like he had to pee but couldn't. It amplified fixated/recurring thoughts to the point of serious debilitation. Doctor advised to try reducing dose. Found Ativan worked better when there was any potential flareup and have used that on an as-needed basis. Reducing dose and hoping to find better solution.	6	September 2, 2020	14
Abilify	Autism	I've had horrible shaking all over my body, even on the smallest dose (2.5mg), to the point where I couldn't walk and was escorted in a wheelchair in my room. This medication was given to me for no apparent reason, like everyone else in the ward (autistic and non autistic). I was the only one not handling it.	1	June 14, 2020	13
Abilify	Autism	My young adult autistic son has recently began taking Abilify at 2ml liquid per day and it is nothing short of a miracle. We have had years of aggression.. hitting biting and smashing our home. He is still the same autistic boy with his usual traits but the aggression is GONE. Tried respiridol previously which did nothing so don't give up... different meds work for different people. Has been taking this for 6 weeks so far.	10	April 24, 2020	47
Abilify	Autism	Abilify has been life changing for our family. Our autistic sons aggression towards his siblings had been a major problem for many years and other drugs that were prescribed didn't help much. Much to our surprise, a day or two after starting abilify our son immediately backed down from arguing for the first time in his life. We were all absolutely stunned. My sons irritable and aggressive  behaviour (due to his autism) wreaked havoc on our family and destroyed relationships between our kids. I just wish our son had been prescribed Abilify before so much damage was done.	9	February 19, 2020	48
Abilify	Autism	Abilify worked to help with aggression but my son is now a serious diabetic. He gained 50 pounds. We are heartbroken.	5	February 4, 2020	28
Abilify	Autism	My son, 17, has been on Abilify for the last three months, and his transitions from one thing to the next is a lot less amplified and his concentration is  stronger. It has only been three months, though, so I will book mark this page and let you know how he is in 3 more months. He's been diagnosed Asperger Syndrome since 5 y.o. Perhaps it works better on AS? He could definitely gain some weight since he is on a weight lifting program. He is a lot less argumentative. He also is a devout believer and  biblical Christianity, so coupled with prayer, bible study, staying away from sexual or violent movies and video games, this makes a difference in this overall health.	10	February 2, 2020	32
Abilify	Autism	Horrible, put me into a comatose state for an hour, after it wore off, I was puking my brains out....my psychiatrist took me off it right away and prescribed something else	1	November 29, 2019	15
Abilify	Autism	We recently tried this for my autistic 10yo son. His dose went from 1ml to 10ml over two weeks and his behaviour spiralled out of control with every increase. He just went from bad to worse to horrific. He couldn’t control his thoughts! He became uncontrollably aggressive and wanted to hurt himself. We ended up phoning Emergancy Pediatrics and they put him back onto Risperidone and everything returned to normal. This is an awful medication.	1	October 27, 2019	19
Abilify	Autism	My 13 yr old is hearing voices, gained a lot of weight since being on this. We are taking her off this.	1	July 28, 2019	18
Abilify	Autism	"My 13 yr old has been on this for about 6 months and the dose went from 5 to 10mg to 20mg and were holding there. Weight gain has been from 165-215lbs. She is 5'8"" so the size of an adult lady. She is so much more in control of her emotions. Her rages are gone, her meltdowns are gone, she is more normal then I've ever seen her be. She gets along with friends and family better. She feels better on it as well. She says she can focus and feels in control of herself."	8	July 5, 2019	34
Abilify	Autism	My son 20 years old autistic he start having aggression lots of anxiety dr put him on Abilify 10 mg morning morning 10 at night his aggression is worse and his also taking Depakote due to couple seizures in his teenagers years, make a story short the Abilify is not helping at all and his psychiatrist wants me to give him 30 mg , I’m lost don’t know what to do		June 27, 2019	17
Abilify	Autism	Son started taking 2mg abilify in Nov and it did great. Helped with his emotional instability. Around Jan-Feb, I noticed that his behavior is back to pre-medication. He’s emotional, crying at everything, and developed aggression. Going to ween him off and find and different medication.	4	March 22, 2019	18
Abilify	Autism	we had my grandson on abilify for a year and we upped his dosage and down it as well, yet his aggression never stopped, We finally got him weaned off and his aggressive behavior has increased severely, also his tics have increased, He can't stop moving he was hitting his feet and head cause his brain is not connecting to his right thoughts. He is high functional autism, I do not recommend this drug to them at all	1	June 10, 2018	14
Abilify	Autism	My 7 year old son is on 2mg. It has completely changed our family. He has not broken a window on kicked in a door since starting abilify. Before birth he was exposed to drug, alcohol, violence, chemotherapy, and pain killers. I adopted him at a year. He is diagnosed with  Reactive attachment disorder (RAD) and Asperger Syndrome. He is so calm now. He still gets irritated if things are not his way, but he is does not act on his anger.	10	June 6, 2018	51
Abilify	Autism	My son already had looping, fast thoughts that were driving him crazy.  Abilify sped those thoughts up and made it worse.  Couldn't wait for the drug to wear off!	1	June 5, 2018	15
Abilify	Autism	This was for my son. The side effects are worse than the original problems.  Extreme weight gain immediately craved food, excessive thirst, already high triglycerides made worse, vision changes immediately.  Trying to get my son off the medication is making the symptoms worse with behavior and insomnia.  He is no longer needing to eat non-stop and he doesn’t use his glasses all day anymore if at all which is how it was before. He has had many almost psychotic episodes screaming that he doesn’t know what he wants to do and completely unable to go to sleep.  He has separation anxiety cannot be alone, increased aggression and work refusal at school. It’s been a month of trying to wean him off. Gradually every step down causes more problems like this.  I highly recommend not trying this drug.  I was pressured into it by the hospital and my ex husband against my wishes.	1	April 28, 2018	13
Abilify	Autism	Took them for a year. Didn't really do much and the side effects outweighed the benefits. It started a pattern of new insomnia where I wake up multiple times a night so I went off of it and got really irritating and anxiety triggering dyskenesia. Over a year since I've taken them and the sleep problems have not stopped. It absolutely fried my short term memory. People are always telling me the same thing over and over again because I can't remember things anymore.	4	February 25, 2018	10
Abilify	Autism	My 7.5 yrs old son has High Functioning Autism and we had tried 10 different meds in the past almost 3 yrs with zero success.  Finally tried Abilify and it has been a miracle drug.  He eats like crazy but no weight gain but he is super active.  He is so happy most of the time, getting great grades now, and wants to got to school.  What a God send! 2mg at night	10	January 31, 2018	39
Abilify	Autism	My 23 year old started Abilify (add on two topamax and zoloft) she had been exhibiting some outbursts and not leaving her apartment.  We only started medicating her when she developed seizures at age 14 and it has been nothing but a series of meds since. I am happy to report that Abilify has seemed to be helpful.  She wants to get out more and hasn't had an outburst in months.	7	August 28, 2017	24
Abilify	Autism	My child has been on Abilify for a while now and we have not noticed any changes really. He still has aggression, self injurious behavior, and extreme levels of impulsivity. I can't take him out in public because he randomly hits people especially small children. If he is prevented from harming others he starts hurts himself until we have to restrain him. He has callouses on his wrists from biting and hitting his mouth repeatedly. The doctor has already increased his Abilify up to 10mg twice a day and he's on Clonidine 0.1mg 6 x's a day, Concerta 54mg a day, Ritalin 10mg a day, and Vistarel 100mg a night and melatonin at night. It's like he is on nothing though. I am terrified to take him off because it might make him worse. I'm so lost.	1	May 28, 2017	40
Abilify	Autism	After 15 years of suffering from all kind of behaviors and agression we found the best neaouroligist in the world who cured my son from autisum, and it was a cure, if he was able to control the bheavior then he cured him to me. My son took 7. 5 abilify in the morning along with 2500mg of depakin chrono at night he took one 25 mg seroquel and depakin and 0. 25 clonozepam.. My life has changed life is beautiful once you find the right combination .. Abilify is a good medication. I love it	10	March 13, 2017	33
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	Abilify helped with my manic episodes, but gained 15 pounds after a month and spiralled into a horrible depression that saw me in bed for weeks after I tried to come off the drug.  Felt near completely disabled. Not for me.	1	February 17, 2020	23
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	This medication has ruined my self esteem and essentially my life. I have gained 50 lbs from this medication. That wasn’t a typo 50 freaking lbs!!! I’ve recently stopped taking it but no weight has come off yet. I’m beside myself. I don’t know what to do. I hate the way I look now.	1	February 6, 2020	38
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	Be careful, Abilify caused a massive compulsive gambling addiction where I lost tens of thousands over time.  I mentioned it to the doctor early on but she ignored it, didn't note it or change the meds.  Guess I was hooked on the buzz.  Stopped taking Abilify.  Stopped gambling recklessly.  Compulsive gambling addiction is a mental health disorder itself.  Who'd have thought that the NHS would prescribe this dangerous drug that can cause it?  Sounds ridiculous but true.  There was a guy with Parkinsons prescribed it in England, went full on the National Lottery online games and scratch cards etc ... but won his case for not being advised properly of the potential side effects and got most of the losses back.  They don't care for my complaint.    A class action lawsuit is underway in the United States because it wasn't on the label.  Suing a big Japanese pharmaceutical company seems okay.  Lost all interest in work and drifted for 18 months.	2	February 2, 2020	25
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	I am diagnosed with Bipolar 1 and in my 20s suffered through 3 major manic psychotic episodes which led to at least month long hospitalizations each time. After the first episode, I was put on zyprexa in which I felt zombified and depressed on which led me to go off of it entirely. Less than a year later I was hospitalized again and at that point I was introduced to Abilify. Three years passed during which I was stable. I then went off of it which led to my third and final hospitalization. Ever since then I took the 20mg tablets religiously and would soon combine it with Lamictal. This combo has worked wonders for me. Years ago a doctor told me that I’m on the Rolls Royce of bipolar medication and I firmly agree. About a year ago I started taking the 400mg injection which helped me lose at least 30 pounds. I find the injection the most effective method of taking Abilify. It has been a life saver for me!	10	January 25, 2020	56
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	Have been on Abilify (Generic) for about a month now. My lows are higher and my highs are nonexistent. I’m mostly flat emotionally, lacking interest in everything, including people. Good for my irritability and delusions, but the side effects are tough.	5	January 19, 2020	34
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	I am a 24 year old male with Bipolar II. Depression is what I struggle with 98% of the time. I have been taking this med  Abilify for about a month now, so long enough. I switched to this from Zyprexa, and that switch was rough. My anxiety came back worse than before on this med and the restlessness was too much for me. I took 5mg and I would get an hour or two of sleep per day and not be able to sit still during the day. I will say that it cured my depression completely, so for that I am grateful. As far as my anxiety, sleep, and overall mood it has not improved. Moving up in dosage caused more restlessness and moving down to 2.5mg or less made me tired and didn't do much for my mood. This med didn't work for me but its not the worst med, give it a shot. I'm switching to Latuda, wish me luck.	6	January 17, 2020	32
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	I am 31, female with bipolar 1 along with depression (obviously lol), extreme social anxiety and PTDS.  I was on abilify, all the way up to 20mgs at the last year or so.  I truly thought it wasn't working or doing ANYTHING for me anymore, so switched to Latuda.  Well the pharmacy was out of stock of Latuda and I had just finished my taper off of Abilify,  so I was about 4-5 days off of any mood stabilizer.  And now I can say that although it may not have been as effective as when I first went on it, it definitely made a difference!  Since the second week of my taper (down to 5 mg, then 2) I applied for some more credit cards and thought nothing of it.  In the past 2 days, I have maxed out all those credit cards.  It wasn't until last night I put the connection to me not being on anything.  I gained a little weight on it, but at the same time,  I allowed myself to eat what I wanted and didn't exercise.  During the taper, I tried seroquel and abilify is nothing as bad as that weight wise.	8	January 8, 2020	27
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	Ability was the first medication prescribed following my bipolar diagnosis, I was told it had a side effect of weight gain. When I first started it, for 14 days, I was MISERABLE...I couldn't eat, sleep, use the restroom, lay down without fidgeting, focus or stop thinking super fast. But on day 15, all those awful effects disappeared. I never experienced anything bad other that weigh gain.  I had the same side effects weaning off it. (That was 300+ pounds ago. I didn't change my eating or exercising habits) In 2017 my new psychiatrist changed medications and I dropped 41 pounds in two years the Abilify slowed my metabolism.  I mainly noticed how it gave me a sense of controlled well being.  In the 15 years I took it, I only missed two doses. I figured if I did my part, medication and stayed actively involved in my own therapy then life would be best it could.	8	December 18, 2019	33
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	Been on every BiPolar med known.  Finally tried Abilify (generic)  and this  for me, is the VERY BEST bipolar medication in the world.  No highs, no lows, NO bipolar  symptoms at all.  I’ve never known in my 45 years that a bipolar drug could make me feel so “normal”.  Truly happy, level headed and carefree.  Sleep is normal for the first time ever.  I’d rate it an “11” if I could!  CHANGED MY LIFE FOR THE BETTER, literally!  I TAKE aripiprazole 10mg once daily, Prozac as well.	10	December 14, 2019	70
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	"Up until recently, I was taking just 1 mg of Abilify along with 300 mg of Lamictal.  My doctor had me on 2, but I felt like it made me feel apathetic and kind of dissociated, so I began cutting the pill in half.  I did notice that I felt less depressed, could focus better, and did not experience such strong mood episodes.   However, within a month I was experiencing this extremely intense paranoia that I never had before.  I had chest pains and headaches regularly.  I couldn't eat and often felt sick because of how anxious I was.  So yes, Abilify did benefit me alongside this weird side effect.  My doctor had me convinced the medication wasn't causing the paranoia, it was ""just me"", but as soon as I stopped taking it the headaches, chest pains, and bursts of anxiety have stopped.  I do feel more depressed and my mood swings have come back harder.  I'm getting a new doctor soon to hopefully put me on another type of antipsychotic"	4	December 9, 2019	20
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	I had so many horrible experiences with  meds for my bipolar. It scared me to try one more but I'm now on 2mg of abilify once daily and found my old self again after a very long time living an unbearable life. The only side effect is slight insomnia and I'm losing the ton of weight that I gained while on seroquel. Abilify saved my life.		December 5, 2019	45
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	This made me feel absolutely horrible. It gave me worse derealization, anxiety, and anhedonia, worse than I have ever had. I do NOT recommend ever trying this stay away from it!!!	1	December 4, 2019	16
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	I was prescribed Abilify after experiencing a 3-4 month long hypomanic episode. I was on Lamictal 100mg but that wasn’t helping alone so my psychiatrist decided to add in Abilify. She also said it would help with the mild paranoid thoughts I was having. This was a horrible medication for me personally. It may work for other people, but it wasn’t for me. It made me flat and I didn’t care about anything anymore. I wasn’t depressed on it, I just didn’t care about anything. Even the people around me commented on how apathetic I had become. It made my fears of psychiatric medications come true. I lost my personality, passion, and energy. I am off of it now, and feel way better. I think it served its purpose of getting me out of my hypomanic episode, which is why I gave it a 4-star rating, but I couldn’t see being on this medication long-term.	4	November 23, 2019	15
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	On Abilify for Bipolar and it is the first time in my entire life that I have felt stable. I have no side effects from this medication. I take it at night and it makes me a bit sleepy which is good for my sleep anyways. I have tried a few other mood stabilizers without success and finally tried Abilify and it works fantastically for me.	10	October 30, 2019	46
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	I HATE this drug! I have the more depressive side of bipolar disorder and for some reason got put on this antipsychotic instead of antidepressants. I have had irritability followed by flat affect. All of my creativity is gone as is my sex drive. I'm starting to get more and more depressed. My medicines provider keeps saying to wait or cancelling appointments! I'm probably going to taper myself off if things don't get changed soon.	2	October 19, 2019	16
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	I feel like a new woman on Abilify! I have Bi-Polar II, anxiety, depression, and PTSD. I have tried Lithium (gained too much weight and my thyroid went wacky), Lamictal (skin rash) and Topamax (which I currently take 50 mg at night to counteract the possible side effect of weight gain with Abilify). I have NOT gained any weight on Abilify! I was hesitant to take it, and now I’m kicking myself for not starting it sooner because I feel amazing! I have energy, depression and anxiety are GONE, and my bi-polar symptoms have vanished. This is a miracle drug for me! Give it a try if you are questioning it, because I wish I would have tried it sooner! I’m 46 years old and I am 5’10” and weigh 165 pounds with a BMI of 24 (Average).	10	October 18, 2019	69
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	This medication  Abilify almost killed me. I started it in January  for bipolar and felt flat and slightly suicidal (as I had before starting it) for about two months on it. Experienced some weight gain. After the two months, I began to have obsessive suicidal thoughts to the point I couldn't concentrate. Oddly enough, I didn't feel depressed just non-stop suicidal thoughts. I got off of it and switched to lithium, haven't had a suicidal thought in months!	1	October 16, 2019	19
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	I tried to give Abilify a chance three times. I find no interest in activities, not suicidal but don’t feel inspired or a purpose to anything, I just want to be in bed all day and I easily get emotionally hurt or offended. I felt everyone would stare and judge me and so my Doctor kept saying that I would get better after a couple of weeks. The first few days I felt very high and happy, I also had high levels of energy but I couldn’t finish one thing before starting another. I also began to feel extreme panic, I had constant panic attacks, flushing sensation and once I began to lessen the dose to come off I experienced vertigo. I had not felt this before and I was in a panic thinking I had some tumor or had something haywire my nervous system and would never be the same. I stopped in July and it’s now October I still have vertigo but not as intense, I was just prescribed Wellbutrin and I’m really hoping it helps me. Everyone is different but this was my personal experience	3	October 11, 2019	11
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	I took abilify for over 6 years and at first it worked very well. Year 2 I started having face twitching, shakiness and stuttering speech. 3rd year I started with tardive dyskinesia. 4-6 ish years I had all the aforementioned and added falling at least 6 times a day, I was so shaky I could barely walk, plus my memory was shot. I couldn't remember my  phone number or email address I had had for 10 years. New psych took me off and within 2 months almost all of the symptoms were gone. I think some of the shakiness and memory loss are permanent but I have a new lease on life. Poison. Pure poison. I wish I could have those 6 years back.	1	October 4, 2019	25
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	Thank you all so much for your candid feedback!! I needed this for support and better understanding. I sobbed reading every comment, because I can relate.  My 18 year old son has psychosis and mania. Meds just changed. Lithium dropped due to “out of range” high toxicity.  Antipsychotic med. Risperidone, no longer affective after a year. He has been on Abilify for 1 week. After 1 day, I could tell his psychosis was disappearing.  He realized date on the calendar, acted as if he had missed a month of his life. Then immediately jumped back in the game! He showered with soap! His obsessive, fixated thoughts and actions stopped, and he quickly  reprioritized his responsibilities.  Side affects- nausea, sick, no appetite for days.  (Zofran) is helping.  Slightly more aggravated at times, pesters family, a little removed, impulsive and quick to snap. It’s only been a week, so hoping these symptoms stop, and mood levels out. Thank you again for sharing! Love and wellness to all	7	October 2, 2019	26
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	Worked well for 2 years but has been less effective lately.	6	September 24, 2019	14
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	Wow. I took it and many of the reviews here could have been me. Was on it for 3 weeks couldn’t take the side effects. My tongue was  swollen 2x it’s size uncontrollable salivating. Anger outbursts that were uncharacteristic of me, impulsivity, akasthasia horrible kicking legs as I tried to go to sleep. Doc was kind enough to pull me off it as I gained 20 pounds in this month. Ridiculous. It was not a “live saver” for me either. 	1	September 1, 2019	13
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	This drug destroyed my life. My sexual urges became insatiable and my drug use went supersonic. After the dust settled my marriage was destroyed,  I’m broke and my credit rating went 750 to 400. I’ve lost all credibility with my family and friends. I started going sideways almost immediately after I started taking Abilify. I had trembling hands   I cut myself and was very irritable.  I became a different person	1	August 28, 2019	10
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	I've been on Abilify 5mg for 3 weeks now (taking for bipolar). I'm naturally a restless person so I like the feeling of having to do something all the time, It makes me feel like I'm contributing. Sleeping about 5-6 hours a night. Weight gain of about 2lbs. I feel better and a little more connected to my husband and kids as compared to when I was on Quetiapine.	7	August 18, 2019	20
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	Well I've been on for 5 days. I'm a little more chill, but completely lost my ability to have an orgasm :( so...idk  	5	August 12, 2019	19
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	This medicine  Abilify has done wonders for my hallucinations ! They are 3/4 the way gone and I've never felt more stable in my whole life. Earlier when I was just depressed so they added Abilify to my Zoloft.  It did not spark joy at all, made me gain 15 pounds. But a year later I developed psychosis and they gave me Abilify once again. It worked like a miracle this time! I have been on this medication for about 6 months and its been so good, highly, highly recommend this if you are experiencing psychosis!	10	August 7, 2019	26
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	I had commented approximately 2 weeks ago  (under the name:  I hate abilify. on the 2019-07-09) regarding the 400 mg abilify injection. Well I saw my new pdoc on the 18th and she is wonderful!!! I am no longer on the injection due to side effects.  In addition to all of the side effects noted previously, I forgot to mention the major weight gain also.  This drug is NOT WEIGHT NEUTRAL!!  IF YOU ARE CONCERNED ABOUT YOUR WEIGHT MOVE ON TO THE NEXT DRUG.  If you're not happy with your current pdoc find someone you are happy with.  Just because we have bipolar disorder or have a mental illness does not mean we can not control what we ingest into our body.  You have a choice!!! If you have a feeling of being trapped and your pdoc not listening to your concerns, MOVE on!!!! Good luck to all of you.....	1	July 28, 2019	24
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	Helped with mania and depression. Stopped taking due to weight gain and erectile dysfunction.	4	July 19, 2019	6
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	 I am on the 400 mg Abilify injection and I am miserable!  My pdoc is the worst.  She does not listen to anything I have to say about the drug regarding side effects.  I am having muscle spasms as I am typing right now.  I also have dry mouth, constipation, depression and agitation. I had this doctor with tunnel vision ten years ago you think I would have learned my lesson, but I do have an appointment on the 18th with a new proc thank god!!!!   God help us all!!!	1	July 9, 2019	15
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	Abilify levels out my mania like nothing else but does nothing for my depression. Causes regular chest pain, weakness, and awful akathesia. Works for the most part, but I would definitely not recommend due to side effects.	4	July 5, 2019	10
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	The most terrible drug I have ever been put on. Always tired, trouble moving and dizziness. Would not recommend this drug to anyone.	1	June 25, 2019	13
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	A psychiatrist of very questionable competence added Abilify to my antidepressant so that I would have to come back more often for visits (my antidepressant was working fine).  The six weeks that I was on Abilify, I could not sit still in a chair for even five minutes.  All I would do is pace.  I have never been classified as bipolar by anyone but this doctor (major depression - yes) and I lived a nightmare while taking Abilify.  I don't wish this on anyone.  If a doctor suggests that you take this drug, please ask a lot of questions and do some research on your own.	1	June 17, 2019	14
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	I was on this for over 3 years. To start with I thought it was working, the last year I had a racing head and high anxiety. Was discharged from psych so had to fight to get seen again to change medication. Realised a few months after coming off it that my finances had changed shortly after starting Abilify and not in a good way. I was never in debt before Abilify. I am 37 too. I’m in a lot of debt because of Abilify because I started taking out loans shortly after starting it amongst other things. Have since read that the FDA made the manufacturing company to list compulsive shopping, compulsive gambling and other excessive behaviours etc as a side effect in May 2016. I started it in August 2015 so was unaware when I researched this medication when I first went on it. No Dr made me aware of this side effect at any point. Please note I have been manic prior to this medication and had never taken out credit or borrowed money.	1	May 21, 2019	14
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	I have a mood disorder and an anxiety disorder. I’ve been taking Zoloft for ~3 years, and although it helped with anxiety, it didn’t touch my intense mood swings. After a very bad mood swing that almost broke up my 7 year relationship, I sought help. My psychiatrist put me on Lamictal first, and it gave me hives. Then we tried trileptal, and the GI side effects were unbearable after 2 weeks. Finally she put me on Abilify and so far it has been great. I’ve been on 2 mg of Abilify (with 50 mg Zoloft) for a week and there have been almost no side effects. I was warned there might be dry mouth or excessive sweating but I’ve been fine. It did cause me to wake up 7-8 times during the night, but I switched to taking it in the morning and now I sleep like a baby again! It has only been a week but I’m starting to feel a difference: I have more energy and I feel more in control of my moods 	9	May 14, 2019	19
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	Terrible experience. Started on 4 mg then the next day I couldn’t stop puking, had dangerously low blood pressure, and they couldn’t feel a pulse. I’m 19 and this is a relatively low dose to start on. I really think this medicine needs to be recalled because it is so dangerous. I would NOT recommend this drug	1	May 9, 2019	14
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	Abilify works well for my bipolar, it really helped with my reaction to stimulus.	10	May 6, 2019	16
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	Caused extreme hysterical sobbing  and suicidal-level depression after only 3 doses. I had to be hospitalized via ambulance, and spent an additional 2 days sobbing in my hospital room with the curtains closed. I’ve had bipolar II for 22 years, and this was, without a doubt, the most nightmarish emotional experience I have ever had.	1	April 19, 2019	11
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	Of all the conditions this medication treats it seems that the lowest reviews come from people, like myself, who have bipolar disorder. I came to this site to read other reviews to see if what I’ve been feeling was somehow related to Abilify. I’m glad I read some of the reviews because now I don’t feel as crazy.   My new psychiatrist was so confident that this medication would work that I’ve been convincing myself to ignore the things that were off but now it’s just unbearable. I am naturally very emotional and before this medication I absolutely hated it but now that I basically feel emotionless I want off of this medication.   I’m envious of how this has been a miracle drug for a lot of people but for me it’s been fogginess, no appetite and just a general feeling “blah”. I also stumble over my words a lot and my creativity feels stifled by it. I’m calling my psychiatrist tomorrow and getting off of this stuff.	1	April 15, 2019	9
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	I took this for three months and it caused me to gain 40+ pounds	1	December 11, 2018	17
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	I’ve tried every mood stabilizer, typical psychotic and atypical antipsychotic for my Aspergers and Bipolar depression, and Abilify always helps the most.  I feel happy on it and it helps me with dysphoric mania consistently.  It does cause weight gain, but I have been able to lose weight on it by cutting calories to 1500 a day and walking regularly.  Plus, it has a generic version now, so it’s cheap!	8	November 30, 2018	23
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	I was started on Abilify  as a mood stabilizer for Bipolar I manic episodes . I was afraid to take it at first (as I am with all meds), but I took 1/4 of the pill days 1-2. Felt no I’ll effects except tiredness. Took 1/2 pill for 2 weeks. Noticed immediately my mood levelled out. Still made me tired at night. Groggy in the morning but wore off as the day went on. Now, on a whole 5mg and so far it has been wonderful! I feel so much happier and levelled off with my moods. I feel normal. It’s fantastic! It still makes me tired when I first take it at night (so I can sleep finally), but the early morning grogginess is much better. Used to last all morning. Now lasts maybe an hour. Love it!!	10	October 28, 2018	21
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	I was once told by a man online that serotonin and dopamine our happy feel good neurotransmitters. And that to contain my bipolar volatility my doctor was turning down the volume. Side effect. I have no get up n go. My head was once a storm.. now a glassy lake. But there is no wind. No sound. No nothing anymore. I feel empty. Numb. Tired, weak, never sad, never happy. Just flat. I’m tapering off of all antipsychotics and moving onto lithium orotate. Life could be so much better. 	2	October 25, 2018	25
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	This drug made my life miserable, dumbed me down, made me like a zombie. Hardly any thoughts or expression & then the Big one..I couldn’t sit down! The side effect Akathisia, which is intense restlessness. sounds like no big deal but it was an everyday, every minute struggle I suffered horribly! I’d walk down the street to pass time I’d count hours till the day was over, I literally couldn’t sit down, I sat to eat and had to stand back up as soon as I stopped chewing. I smoked cigarettes for 8 years and I tried to quit every Sunday, turns out that one treatment for Akathisia is nicotine. My doc never picked up on it and I was taking Abilify so long I thought it was just what I had become. When I went off of Abilify I could live again. In almost every way. Not only can I sit down in peace but I can think clearly. I didn’t realize how much it was DUMBING ME DOWN. Don’t take this Just work on yourself, take other meds. This medication is like a mild lobotomy. Not worth it	1	October 24, 2018	21
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	I am a 42 year old woman and  diagnosed with Bipolar and ADHD.  I highly recommend this medication. I was at 10mg and it rescued me from a manic episode that was so bad that I was psychotic. It not only cleared that right up, but it improved my concentration. I did suffer from minor akethesia.  I was able to control it without a problem.  However, three years later, I have gained a lot of weight. I am now taking 5mg and monitoring with my doc. After a month, the weight is coming off, but I am now hypomanic...a beautiful yet scary place to be.  Where to go from here, I’m not sure.	7	October 21, 2018	16
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	I felt like a different person. I felt weird, socially with drawn, and introverted. I had fogginess in the back of my head. I had no appetite or sex drive. I had shaky legs and hands. I was up all night. I would have times where my eyes were out of focus and I couldn’t see straight. Please do not take this medication. Everybody is different but my experience was horrible. As I stopped taking it, these side effects are going away. I couldn’t function or do simple tasks.	1	October 3, 2018	19
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	Hello, I will love to share My experience with this medication. My name is Tay, and I was diagnosed with Bipolar disorder with major mood swings affecting my daily life such as work. I tried Abilify 10 mg and it make me feel like the living dead, no energy feeling tired and really bad increase of anxiety and feeling paranoid. I was then lowered the dosage to 5mg, however is still make me tired and increased of anxiety. My physician does not want to take me off of it. I really do not wish to proceed with this medication. I stopped taking it without letting my doctor know. I really hope to tried something else Thanks	1	October 2, 2018	18
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	I've had unexpected benefits with this drug.  For one I am hypoglycemic, and this tends to keep my sugars normal.  Plus when I'm off meds I tend to drink to keep my mind under control-thats a bad thing since I have gastritis.  I had been off it for about two weeks and drank last night and was up half the night with my stomach.  I'm not an alcoholic, have discussed my drinking habits with the doctor, they are not concerned.  But I have started my meds today again because of my stomach.  I love being unmedicated, but this helps me control my thoughts and I don't tend to get out of control on it.  So yes, works 10/10 for me.  I like latuda a little better than this med, but due to cost I'll stick with this one for now.	10	September 29, 2018	11
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	Gave me extremely painful full-body cramps after a week.	1	September 29, 2018	2
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	After a few weeks it had me unsettled and tapping my feet 90 miles and hour  It made me nervous  I went down on my dosage to 7.5 and I’m better but want off of it  I’m just without personality and I feel like there’s something better I could take	3	July 13, 2018	12
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	Started taking with vistaril after a hospitalization. First caused stomach upset, nausea, and headache. But now nothing! I’m waaaay more stable and focused. I get sleepy in the afternoon because I take my meds at noon with lunch.	9	June 24, 2018	10
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	This drug was initially good at mitigating some aspects of mania for me. It also made me feel less anxious and I cared less about what others thought of me for a few months. The drug seemed to loose its effectiveness and my psychiatrist said it may have been amplifying self harm thoughts. For these reasons I give it a 5/10. I am now on risperidol.	5	June 12, 2018	7
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	It did not stabilize my moods. I’m still all over the place, and the fact that I can’t sit still get really under my nerves. I’m super paranoid on this. I feel 10x worse than I did before. It messed me up completely. Side Effects: Severe akathisia, High anxiety, Paranoia, Delusions, Mania, Depression, Suicidal Ideation. I only took this for 2 weeks at a low dose of 5mg and I'M DONE.	3	June 5, 2018	19
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	Horrible experience with Abilify. Was like taking speed, but in a really inefficient mess of a way. Could not keep on top of my work, would start a million things and finish none. Stopped after less than a week of use.	2	May 17, 2018	11
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	Weight gain and depression	4	May 13, 2018	10
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	I have a love-hate relationship with this drug. On one hand, it immediately stopped my paranoid thoughts and delusions and made me feel normal again.. mentally. On the other hand, it gave me this unshakable restless and irritated energy. I wasn't able to sit still, complete anything I loved, or even listen to friends. If you don't mind feeling like you have to run a marathon an hour this might work for you.	5	April 18, 2018	11
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	I was on abilify for a diagnosis of mixed bipolar disorder and generalized anxiety disorder  following a hospitalization. I was on it for about a year . I found it helpful, and easily tolerated at first - it helped reduce hallucinations and paranoia while improving my fluctuating mood. However, even at its highest dose, it wasn’t strong enough or potent enough for me I suppose - it just didn’t match up. I continued to have some paranoia and whenever I was more upset than usual, I’d have breakthrough hallucinations. What made the docs take me off of it was the oral twitching I developed and bizarre tongue movements, which are signs of tardive dyskinesia, a rare side effect. Newer antipsychotics have less instances of this condition, but it’s still possible. Anyway, I was taken off of it and placed on another antipsychotic. Still have tongue movements though... An overall okay drug, it works for a lot of people, but not everyone!	8	March 27, 2018	7
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	I have been on abilify since Sept 2017. I haven't gained weight, no side effects so far and no anxiety. This drugs helps me to focus and concentrate. It also keeps my moods stable. I take this with lithium 1200mg and seroquel 100mg for sleep. Hopefully it keeps on working.	8	January 31, 2018	11
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	I've suffered from Bipolar 2 and GAD and ADD for 15 yrs now. I take Lamictal, Effexor XR, Abilify and Adderall.  Not until I started Abilify 3 weeks ago have I had any improvement with energy levels and depression. I have treatment resistant depression and my anxiety causes me to not be able to work and I barely want to leave the house. But since starting Abilify, I feel almost fantastic. I wake up early ready to start my day. And I've never been a morning person. I'm more positive about my life and I am even thinking about getting a job. I haven't worked in 6 years. But I do have problems staying asleep . I mean, its 3:06am and I am wide awake writing this. So yeah, restless sleep. And the sexual side effects aren't good. Total lack of interest which is difficult when you're in a relationship. But I'm not willing to stop this medication.The good far outweighs the bad in so so many ways. Good luck to all and give this med a try		January 31, 2018	18
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	One day and done. I've never experienced side effects like this before. I took it before bed and then was up every few hours, restless, mind racing. Finally I shot up at 4am and NEEDED to shower. While in there my head was so heavy, I couldn't stand any more. I had to rest my head. Then I got so nauseated I started to dry heave. Now I'm heavy headed, blurry, dizzy, restless, & afraid to stand up or drive. I will never take this drug again.		January 18, 2018	16
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	I took it once which made a horrible experience for myself. I woke up from a nap and I had double vision, nausea, vomiting and fainted because of Abilify.	1	December 30, 2017	8
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	I'm not sure what mental issues I have exactly, they've told me this and that over the past 15 years. I got people talking going on and seeing them. I also have anger outbursts and take things out on myself, but doesn't happen when I hear and see the people. So anyway, I tried Risperdal before from my doc and it helped me to be able to read and understand what I read, but with Abilify it's not as good, although Risperdal made me have gynecomastia big time, and Abilify doesn't cause as much prolactin. I think it's a decent medication, but the voices and seeing people are still strong and break through the veil, even the mask of the medication, so I'm not cured. But it's better than nothing I guess. But one day I may go off of it.	7	December 2, 2017	4
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	This drug has been a lifesaver to me. It's helped provide me with mood stability with an antidepressant effect, whereas lithium only controlled the mania part of my mood. I use this in combination with other drugs  and so far there hasn't been any side effects. I tried decreasing the dosage, and within 2 days I noticed a difference in my mood. I would definitely recommend this drug. This has made a difference in my mood, the way I think, and my overall perspective. This improved my motivation to get work done, since I wouldn't be just sitting around reminiscing in a negative thought loop. It gives me mental freedom and allows me to escape brain fog that has imprisoned my thoughts. Seriously, don't be afraid to try this drug	9	November 27, 2017	25
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	Was put on Abilify to control hypomania. I'm very, very sensitive to pretty much every medication. Initial I had a stomach ache that only lasted one night and some tiredness the first two days. However... After this I had severe hypomania and restlessness that just didn't go away. It wasn't akasteisia though. Unfortunately I can't reach the mood stabilizing effect - being at least 10 mg - since I can't go any higher than 1.25 mg without having side effects such as emotional numbness, numbness of my face, twitching, increased eye blinking - which of course scares me since there is a risk of Tardive Dyskinesia. It's definitely a very powerfull drug. BUT it really did help my depression and anxiety, just didn't help control my hypomania. LOL	3	October 23, 2017	9
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	"The medication, at first, did was it was supposed to do. I was a shut in with some paranoia thrown in and hadn't left my house in over a year, except to go to doctors appointments and get groceries in the house. At first I found the medication got me out and about and got me back into the real world. I signed up for college, got in contact with friends I hadn't talked with in ages, and started living again. For that, this drug was fine. Then the side effects started kicking in. Keep in mind I was on 2mg of this drug and even then the side effects were bad enough to knock me OUT of college and suffer something called ""Depersonalization through Disassociation"". One of the scariest experiences I think I've ever had. I don't recommend it."	3	October 20, 2017	15
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	This medication was the worst experience of my life and I've been through a lot of rubbish.  I experienced insomnia depression anxiety and pesudo ME on abilify. I was on it for 3 months and I spent my time feeling lobotomised and wanting to give up on life. It took me 3 months to fully get back to my old self. Going between depressed and manic. I found a medication that works for me with out professional help afterwards.	1	September 30, 2017	11
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	When I first starting taking abilify, I was about 14 and a half and 130 pounds, and it worked great. My mood was great, side effects were minimal. However, over the course of about a year I have gained almost 60 pounds, and that was while playing two varsity sports and a club sport that whole time, so I was active majority of that time. When I came off it recently, I lost about 10 pounds over two weeks, but I was much worse than I was before I went on it, (which I find weird), so I was put back on. It is impossible to get the weight to go away.	2	September 30, 2017	9
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	I got extreme manic symptom after I used Abilify for one month. I feel very anxious and scared about everything. I have an illusion energy which leads me push up double times more than no medication usage, but I feel very weak and extreme anxiety in the next few days. It increases my distance between up and down emotion very far away, but the distance between up and down emotion should be neutral. After I withdraw all of them carefully with herbal sleeping pills for alternative, my distant emotion becomes shorter which changes to be neutral condition. When my emotion and mood become neutral, my excessive emotional reaction no longer appear anymore.		September 19, 2017	6
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	I was given this medicine by a regular medical doctor in tandem with Prozac and Ambien.  What a horrible combo!!!!  After being on Abilify for several weeks every nerve ending in my body felt like they were on fire.  I was hyper and couldn't stay seated.  I found out that this medicine was burning my brain and causing Akathisia.   I called my doctor and told him what was going on and he wanted to double the milligram.  I said....ohhhhhhhh no your not!!!!!  Because of this medicine combo things got so bad I tried suicide back in February of 2015.  I took 13 sleeping pills. The hospital doctor in the psych ward said the combination I was on was wrong and he was surprised I wasn't in the hospital earlier !!!	1	August 30, 2017	11
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	I give Abilify the highest rating. I'm a 42 year old female with PTSD, Bipolar Depression, ADHD. I have tried every anti-depressant out there, from Amoxapine to Zyprexa, in which I experienced some extremely negative side effects from.  So, needless to say, I am rather reluctant when having to start taking a medication that I've never tried before.  (I've been taking 60mg of Prozac (fluoxetine) daily for the past several years). As of late, I've been experiencing increased symptoms in my bipolar depression.  My doctor prescribed Abilify 5mg about 2 months ago.  I have noticed such a positive change in myself. After only about 5-7 days of taking Abilify did I start to notice a change in my mood, attitude, outlook on life. It's been great!		August 17, 2017	17
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	It's just silence in my head, its hard to think. I don't have schizophrenia. I just can't really think clearly. All night I stayed up dizzy and nauseous but I'm gonna continue the medicine in hopes that it loosens up and keeps me mellow headed. After the initial nausea I felt pretty chill.   (If it gets better I will keep you guys updated.)	4	August 4, 2017	7
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	I had a bad time with this drug. It worked on my mood, but whenever I stood up, I got dizzy. I fell down the stairs once. Plus even with insurance, it's really expensive.	3	August 2, 2017	6
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	I like this medication, but it causes my prolactin levels to go up. Which in turn cause my breast to leak milky fluid. Dr said he thinks it is from Invega injection. I just cannot take this side effect	6	July 11, 2017	4
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	I have been on this for three days. The first day was horrific and I was definitively going to quit. I felt more trapped and traumatized by the 'problem things' I am dealing with than ever. The weird thing is I  liked my psychiatrist but I felt the drug was killing me. I was horrified by some of the things I am dealing with but now three days later I feel it is starting to balance things out and put me in a humored mood from my 'problems' rather than a traumatized one. I swore off of all psychiatric pills for the past fourteen years, but decided to give it another shot. In the big picture, I think it is the right decision, but it is making me worrisomely hungry.		June 26, 2017	8
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	I didn't notice a big difference on Ablify. I feel more level headed but also I feel more indecisive, dizzy and restlessness. I was on 10 mg for 3 months and the restlessness was so bad I couldn't sit still.	5	June 26, 2017	13
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	I've been prescribed ability and loxapac for a manic episode on May 19th for slightly more than three weeks. It worked well but early June I started to feel unable to sit  still at some places. Around June 10th I had terrible anxiety and panic attacks, it was pure torture, so back to the institution. Had to wait two days until a doctor showed up , gave me something that stopped it all and removed the two drugs. It might be loxapac. Fact is, since then, there is another torture. Akathisia in the form of wanting to walk all the time. It's been one week now and thanks god it stops at night. I want to live (I'm not even 20)  I pray it stops fast  l've suffered enough. I really hate Abilify or Loxapac	1	June 19, 2017	4
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	Started taking Abilify in August of 2016. The day after I wanted to drink. I'm a recovering alcoholic, called my physciatrist and she switched seroquel to Thorazine. And I got over the next couple of days. I just received an inheritance somehow I ended up with 191 Groupons, online shopping I couldn't have controlled so much in an amnesia state. Wouldn't have known this was happening. Went to Dr and hospitals 8 or 9 times with different things of Abilify! I had an suicide attempt in March. I stayed awake for 4 days afterwards. I've wrecked my car 4 times. I have TD and Akatasia now. I've never had a drug complicate me as much!   I was also severely anorexic.	1	June 15, 2017	4
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	I have bipolar II, cycle up in spring and major depressive in the fall. I have tried lamictal, great drug but got the rash, geodon, ok but felt like I was drunk, latuda, got the jaw pain whitch was awful. Ability seems to help with the overwhelming agitation I get in the spring time. I hope it is as good in the fall for my depression phase.	8	May 15, 2017	10
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	I've been on abilify for almost a month the only side effect I have is waking up in the middle of the night a few times I have actually lost 12 pounds I am eating good and drinking plenty of water so I'm sure that helps I'm also on Zoloft and topamax all in all it's a much better drug than my previous geodon I would recommend it	6	May 12, 2017	12
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	After taking anti-psychotic medications for 9 years and trying just about every single one of  them, I have finally found one that is working for me, at this point in my life. I started this medication  (Abilify) nearly 4 months ago and the positive changes I’ve seen in my life make me so happy. I have  lost almost 30 pounds within these last several months, I have been more active with my children, and I  actually get off the couch and walk and enjoy life. I’ve been involved with my “FitBit” challenges which I  would’ve never attempted to even think about doing before. My manic episodes are very rare and less  erratic. Before when I would be on a anti-psychotic  medication I would feel like I was in a “zombie mode” barely functioning day by day. The only downfall I have with this medication (Abilify), which is a side effect, is if I get up to  quickly I get dizzy and just collapse. Now I’m at a plateau with my weight, but I’m not gaining weight  either. I give this Anti-Psychotic Medication a 9 out of 10.	9	April 28, 2017	32
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	Excellent. Depression lifted fast. Stabilizes my mood very well, as a bonus I spontaneously los 55 lbs! All that weight came from Seroquel and Zyprexa. Con, has a negative effect on sleep, I need melatonin to be able to sleep. Also my blood pressure is suddenly a lot lower, 102/63 causing some light headedness during the day.  It's however the first med that is able to stabilize my mood very well with very acceptable side effects.	8	April 17, 2017	25
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	I'm not an easy patient, unsatisfied with the weight gain from the typical atypicals, lacking an 'oomph' from lithium, allergic to lamotrgine and anti-depressants give me a one way ticket to the manic rollercoaster.   I started Abilify and within 3 days I was hypermanic and nauseous to boot. No sleep, spending $400 on some bed sheets seemed like a marvellous idea, thrill seeking etc and throwing up every 3 hours.   However my psychiatrist guided me through it with sleep meds and something to settle the stomach and I'm so glad I pushed through.   Yeah, the restlessness is an issue but I'd like to consider myself an 'experience and going out' person now. Anything better than the listlessness of depression or meds that are supposed to cure it.	9	April 4, 2017	19
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	I have rapid-cycling bipolar and have been on Abilify for a little over 7-8 months. At first, I was on the Abilify by its self and I experienced worsened anxiety and depression. I was thinking about switching drugs after a few weeks of these negative feelings not going away, so my Pdoc added Zoloft to my mix. This combination was a life saver for me. I would definitely recommend using Abilify as an add-on. My mania is manifested as rage, impulsiveness, and rapid negative thoughts in my head and Abilify stopped that for me. The only negative side effect I have now is weight gain. I've only gained 8 pounds, but I have to ignore my food cravings.	8	March 27, 2017	13
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	I took this med for 2 weeks.   Within 3 days I was in full thrown into full a total manic state.  I was awake every night by 3am because I couldn't sleep.  I spent quite a significant amount of money in a short amount of time!  I also put 4 pounds on in this time.  The only positive thing I can say is that it gave me energy.  The reason my pdoc tried me on it was depression and lack of energy.  I also have bipolar and have been on Lithium for 3 years and have been steady until I took Abilify. Needless to say I have stopped taking this med.	3	March 26, 2017	7
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	I have been on abilify for 6 weeks now and am still experiencing anxiety, agitation, constipation. I also feel sedated although I feel like I can't sit still.	5	March 24, 2017	15
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	"I started Abilify because my bipolar disorder drug cocktail became less effective. Abilify was new on the market. It lifted my mood considerably, I felt great. And without any bad side effects. I thought.  After about 6 weeks I developed hand tremor. It got worse. My psychopharmacologist sent me to a neurologist who began treating me for a kind of tremor that's inherited. He did not believe it was due to Abilify- which now has a side effect listed as ""muscle movements that could become permanent."" Naturally I stopped taking Abilify. So either the neurologist is right, and Abilify activated the tremor or I developed the permanent muscle movement side effect. Either way, I now have to take an anti-tremor drug."	1	March 23, 2017	10
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Agitated State	I’ve been dealing with anger/mood issues. My psychiatrist put me on 5mg Abilify. I took it last night for the first time. I woke up puking, and having diarrhea. I have had a dizzy spell, if I get up. My heart will race. It was recommended to take before bedtime. But, I’ve been up all night. Wasn’t a pleasant experience.	2	April 9, 2021	4
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Agitated State	I take 2.5mg of Abilify.  Abilify is my miracle drug. I have struggled with anxiety my entire life, and have PTSD. I used to struggle with feeling rage, intrusive thoughts that I just couldn’t shake and general overwhelming  anxiety. Tried and quit at least ten other meds before finding this one.   I know it works because if I accidentally forget a dose one day my anxiety is back in full force for 2-3 days after. Once it’s back in my system I’m fine again.   I haven’t had any noticeable side effects. I take trazodone and melatonin for sleep so I have no problems sleeping, and I have been intentionally losing weight by counting calories with no problem.   I quit a different med that was making my hair thin before starting this, and my hair has all come back on Abilify.   I have a prescription for a benzo for anxiety as needed, but I don’t need it anymore.	10	February 11, 2021	9
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Agitated State	The side effects are bad at first - do not take Abilify at night! My feet were erratic starting out and I had a hard time sleeping because I took it at night. Another side effect: Weight gain does occur! But, this is not because the pill has calories (one review said) or because it gives you munchies (another review said). It simply changes the way your body stores leptin and processes food. Adding in slight exercise, or reducing your calories with healthier foods might help - or if you are lucky, it might not affect you at all. I did not notice the weight gain effects on the 5 mg, but I did on the 10 mg. I have gained three pounds in one week. Personally, the weight is not something I can handle, so I will be going back to 5 mg because that worked just fine for me.   It might take some experimenting but try it first (always start with a low dose).	7	February 5, 2021	5
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Agitated State	"My son was prescribed Abilify for ""aggressive"" behavior at age 6. It didn't really change his behavior. Within a year he began showing symptoms of ADHD, despite no signs before starting the med. Is the restlessness really ADHD, or is it akathisia caused by the med? He also became compulsive on Abilify, which I learned only recently is a known side-effect of the medication. His BMI is now borderline obese, and his metabolic labs are all elevated. I'm now tapering him off of it after more than 3 years. I've noticed a reduction in his compulsive and thrill seeking behavior, though he still can't sit still for the life of him. Hopefully those withdrawl side-effects will subside with time. If a doctor recommends your child take a mood-stabilizer, remember that a calm parent is the best mood-stabilizer for a child. This stuff isn't FDA approved for use in children for a reason. I'm not anti-medication and I'm sure this med works for some people, but this med did not work for him."	1	January 25, 2021	4
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Agitated State	I was put on this many years ago for a nervous breakdown and it started to help almost instantly. It was a good add on to my anti depressants at the time. I was literally only on it two weeks and doc decided I didn't need it anymore. It worked a lot better than any other things I've been on over the years. No side effects	8	January 15, 2021	8
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Agitated State	I was recently  prescribed  abilify (the generic) during  COVID. I have PTSD BPD and depression  so with  everything  going  on it has made me insane.  I had rage outbursts and would  want to hit people, not to mention the stress and lockdown.  Everytime  I left the house  there's signs and masks everywhere- anyways I needed a change.  I tried Abilify I'm on 5mg now, I found  it actually  increased my appetite,  I gained at least  10 lbs which  I'm not fond of, but I've been  eating  again.  I find it has worked great  as far as a mood stabilizer I've only had 1 panic attack since being on it. The first few weeks  I was really  agitated and paranoid  though. If I don't take it at the exact time everyday I feel  sick.  Overall it does help with my mood and rage so I'll stay on it. I don't like the always  having  to move,  its nice  at work  but not if I ever want to relax	7	December 1, 2020	10
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Agitated State	Honestly I feel horrible, even after 24 hrs of taking Abilify, I am a MESS, I can’t keep anything down, I feel sick. I feel like I should just run around to get rid of this horrible feeling. My ears are ringing. I can’t get rid of this weird muffled head feeling it’s a nasty drug. I just cannot relax. I’m more panicky and agitated than usual	1	September 8, 2020	22
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Agitated State	"Im going to keep it short & sweet. Before Abilify it was a lot of swearing and slammed doors, and irritation towards everyone. Abilify 5mg was prescribed about 2 months ago. Life now is more of a ""what was I mad about""? Great mood stabilizer. This medication has lifted me in so many ways.  Background: Bipolar, depression & anxiety..."	9	August 15, 2020	73
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Agitated State	My 9 year old son started Abilify a week ago. Prior to, he was diagnosed with Intermittent Explosive Disorder and possibly ADHD. He has struggled with intense burst of extreme anger. He would yell, scream, throw things, hit himself, slam doors etc. He would be angry very quickly over small things. He was very impulsive, and had many troubles at school focusing. We tried 2 different ADHD meds with no luck. They actually made things worse. His behaviour changed the moment he started Abilify, at a low dose of 2mg a day. We expected weeks until seeing results. My child is a completely different person. He is calm, polite, and so pleasant. He has voiced his own opinion on feeling this med is working. He can feel the difference within himself. He displays no side effects. He still feels and shows emotions, just in a calm manner. We have struggled heartbreakingly for a long time in finding him help, with nothing that has actually worked. This has absolutely changed his life.	9	August 6, 2020	59
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Agitated State	Been on Abilify 2mg for one week. Started Abilify to help with PTSD and Lupus. Periods of high anxiety causes my Lupus to flare. No anxiety = no Lupus. Anxiety is gone which is wonderful, but it's been replaced with nausea. It's not bad enough to cause vomiting, just annoying. I have no appetite and have lost 4 pounds so far. Some trouble sleeping. I take melatonin to help with that. I hope the nausea goes away. If it does, Abilify could be the one for me.	7	February 12, 2020	34
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Agitated State	My daughter is 9 and has been diagnosed with ADHD and ADD. She has mostly had issues with impulsiveness. She was in a constant state of anger and irritability. Previously she tried a stimulant medication which worked for awhile then became ineffective. She now takes Intuniv and Abilify. She has been on the Abilify for about 3 months and seems like a new child. She is happy, almost always in a good mood, and reacts appropriately instead of with anger. Hopefully the results will last. As of right now I am very excited about the results and the improvement of her mood and behavior.	8	October 31, 2019	37
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Agitated State	Ok my idiot shrink is being fired tomorrow. I've bee  reading up on this abilify stuff and guess what I have ADHD depression anxiety.  In menopause so what is he put me on Abilify this stuff makes me insanely psychotic and vicious.  The least little thing goes wrong and I'm screaming I mean literally screaming at the top of my lungs and freaking out. I will not take the stuff I am not bipolar I have other issues thank you very much it's terrible drug never again	1	July 28, 2019	27
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Agitated State	I have been taking abilify 1mg for almost 3 weeks now  for racing thoughts and I don't find the side effects are going away, I have terrible restless feeling, fast heartbeat, terrible cloudy head feeling and vomiting. I hate the side effects and think  I'm going to stop taking it. I am super sensitive to meds so I started at .5 and even then had the same thing, it sucks because it did help the racing thoughts but does nothing for my anxiety or depression disorder.	3	July 12, 2019	19
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Agitated State	On this drug I get anger and agitation. Going to go on something else instead can't bear it	1	June 9, 2019	21
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Agitated State	From the time my son could walk he was getting into trouble, he always had problematic tendencies, and very defiant. Everything I mean EVERYTHING was a fight. Life was a struggle. He started attending day care at 3.5years and ultimately got kicked out. He was put on blood pressure medicine at the age of 4, (hardly did anything.) ADHD medication; methanphetamine at age 5 (only worsened his symptoms.) resperidone at 6yrs, which took the edge off but he became more irritable only after 3mth. And Abilify age 7 and thus far his behavior, aggression, attention span has improved and everyone in the house hold and school does nothing but compliment how well mannered he is!!! (I never thought this day would come) yes he has gained weight but the benefits outweigh the side effects. I’m so grateful for this medication!!!!  Finding what works or doesn’t work has been a trial and error process, but in my mind ability is a miracle drug.	10	October 24, 2018	37
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Agitated State	I was started on this to try to help my misophonia (reaction to sounds such as dripping water, chewing, snapping gum or repetitive noises, such as pencil tapping) after Risperdal (made me feel like a zombie) and Seroquel (just knocked me out) didn't work, and I've actually been quite happy with the results.  I still get irritated by people chewing gum around me, but the Abilify helps me not to dwell on the thoughts and worries about the future that cause most of my anxiety. I can move on from a bad situation in less than a minute now, rather than dwelling on it for hours at a time and thinking myself into a deep dark hole.	7	February 1, 2018	27
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Agitated State	Gave me akathisia that still does not go away 8 days after quitting while it should. I need to be moving all the time (in a car or something like that counts ) and it's unbearable.	1	June 20, 2017	13
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Agitated State	My little brother was on this medicine for close to a week and half and the second he realized it wasn't helping him he stopped taking them and the life is sucked out of his body.  He has cold sweats and struggles to find a meaning for life.  Before he was happy and just had some major issues with our parents so the psychiatrist prescribed him this.    This is a bad  drug .  1 star.  Cry on your friend shoulders until your better but don't take this drug if I met the creator of this I would express to him/her how many lives he probably responsible for- it is a disgrace to society.		May 24, 2017	13
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Agitated State	Abilify made me extremely aggitated about the smallest things that wouldn't normally anger me. The time I was on it I am surprised I didn't end up in prison or a psych ward. One of the worst experiences of my life..   They must have had a good ad campaign for this drugs, because doctors seems to think it is the answer to everything. Fact is, the two trials done for the drug before it became the next coming of Jesus were done by the drug company who made it. Funny thing is, thy didn't hide in their trial that is caused agitation in a little less than half of their patients, which raises the question of why these companies even bother doin trials. They should just sell sugar pills, because it is clear that money was their only motivator...	1	March 13, 2017	24
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Autism	This really helped my rage/irritability but not possible to continue taking due to severe weight gain. I was put on it when I was 12 and it completely halted my metabolism. I was 75lbs when I started it and within 2 months I was 140lbs. I went from a double zero size to a size 13 in just 8 weeks. I no joke could gain weight from eating an apple. I have stretch marks and extra skin to this day (12 years later) from it. I got off it as soon as we switched drs (my dr at the time refused).	3	April 15, 2021	1
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Autism	This type of medication is not for autism. It was ok for a month whilst my son was distracted by the side effects. He then became more aggressive and argumentative and was hyperactive. He also developed OCD. Risperidone did not work either and he had tics on it.	1	March 26, 2021	2
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Autism	I take it with Lexapro, and it’s been amazing for my depression and irritability. I feel better than I have in years. The only side effects I don’t care for is the insomnia/waking up in the middle of the night.	7	February 11, 2021	4
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Autism	My son was prescribed Abilify years ago on a low dosage and it seemed to help him a lot. He had some weight gain but not much. As he got older and bigger he started having issues again and he was taken off Abilify and put on Risperidone. It was a complete disaster and things got bad really, really fast. Eventually he was put back on Abilify at a higher dosage and taken off Risperidone and things are much better. I recommend Abilify over Risperidone any day for autism.		December 31, 2020	16
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Autism	My daughter (13) was put on Abilify when she was 7 for aggression and severe behaviours. At first it seemed to help but after awhile she was just back to her usual severe behaviours. She use to be a tiny girl but she became over weight very quickly with this med. We had to put locks on the fridge and cupboards but then she literally ripped the doors off to get to the food!! Over the years we tried to wean her off several times but the side effects of weaning were terrible so every time we would put her back on. This time we have been weaning her off very very slowly over several months now, weaning down 2.5 mgs a month and it’s been much easier on her system. We have noticed a dramatic change in her seizures and she hasn’t had one in months now. We haven’t seen any changes in her behaviours, she isn't any worse, the same today on 2.5 mgs as she was when she was on 20mgs. So we really don’t think it was doing anything for her.	1	October 2, 2020	20
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Autism	15 year old son was prescribed Abilify for anxiety and aggression that started recently. It stopped the aggression and regulated his sleep cycle nicely. However, after 5 months, he started having crying episodes and seemed depressed mixed with mood swings.  Side effects included drooling and feeling like he had to pee but couldn't. It amplified fixated/recurring thoughts to the point of serious debilitation. Doctor advised to try reducing dose. Found Ativan worked better when there was any potential flareup and have used that on an as-needed basis. Reducing dose and hoping to find better solution.	6	September 2, 2020	14
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Autism	I've had horrible shaking all over my body, even on the smallest dose (2.5mg), to the point where I couldn't walk and was escorted in a wheelchair in my room. This medication was given to me for no apparent reason, like everyone else in the ward (autistic and non autistic). I was the only one not handling it.	1	June 14, 2020	13
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Autism	My young adult autistic son has recently began taking Abilify at 2ml liquid per day and it is nothing short of a miracle. We have had years of aggression.. hitting biting and smashing our home. He is still the same autistic boy with his usual traits but the aggression is GONE. Tried respiridol previously which did nothing so don't give up... different meds work for different people. Has been taking this for 6 weeks so far.	10	April 24, 2020	47
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Autism	Abilify has been life changing for our family. Our autistic sons aggression towards his siblings had been a major problem for many years and other drugs that were prescribed didn't help much. Much to our surprise, a day or two after starting abilify our son immediately backed down from arguing for the first time in his life. We were all absolutely stunned. My sons irritable and aggressive  behaviour (due to his autism) wreaked havoc on our family and destroyed relationships between our kids. I just wish our son had been prescribed Abilify before so much damage was done.	9	February 19, 2020	48
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Autism	Abilify worked to help with aggression but my son is now a serious diabetic. He gained 50 pounds. We are heartbroken.	5	February 4, 2020	28
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Autism	My son, 17, has been on Abilify for the last three months, and his transitions from one thing to the next is a lot less amplified and his concentration is  stronger. It has only been three months, though, so I will book mark this page and let you know how he is in 3 more months. He's been diagnosed Asperger Syndrome since 5 y.o. Perhaps it works better on AS? He could definitely gain some weight since he is on a weight lifting program. He is a lot less argumentative. He also is a devout believer and  biblical Christianity, so coupled with prayer, bible study, staying away from sexual or violent movies and video games, this makes a difference in this overall health.	10	February 2, 2020	32
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Autism	Horrible, put me into a comatose state for an hour, after it wore off, I was puking my brains out....my psychiatrist took me off it right away and prescribed something else	1	November 29, 2019	15
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Autism	We recently tried this for my autistic 10yo son. His dose went from 1ml to 10ml over two weeks and his behaviour spiralled out of control with every increase. He just went from bad to worse to horrific. He couldn’t control his thoughts! He became uncontrollably aggressive and wanted to hurt himself. We ended up phoning Emergancy Pediatrics and they put him back onto Risperidone and everything returned to normal. This is an awful medication.	1	October 27, 2019	19
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Autism	My 13 yr old is hearing voices, gained a lot of weight since being on this. We are taking her off this.	1	July 28, 2019	18
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Autism	"My 13 yr old has been on this for about 6 months and the dose went from 5 to 10mg to 20mg and were holding there. Weight gain has been from 165-215lbs. She is 5'8"" so the size of an adult lady. She is so much more in control of her emotions. Her rages are gone, her meltdowns are gone, she is more normal then I've ever seen her be. She gets along with friends and family better. She feels better on it as well. She says she can focus and feels in control of herself."	8	July 5, 2019	34
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Autism	My son 20 years old autistic he start having aggression lots of anxiety dr put him on Abilify 10 mg morning morning 10 at night his aggression is worse and his also taking Depakote due to couple seizures in his teenagers years, make a story short the Abilify is not helping at all and his psychiatrist wants me to give him 30 mg , I’m lost don’t know what to do		June 27, 2019	17
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Autism	Son started taking 2mg abilify in Nov and it did great. Helped with his emotional instability. Around Jan-Feb, I noticed that his behavior is back to pre-medication. He’s emotional, crying at everything, and developed aggression. Going to ween him off and find and different medication.	4	March 22, 2019	18
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Autism	we had my grandson on abilify for a year and we upped his dosage and down it as well, yet his aggression never stopped, We finally got him weaned off and his aggressive behavior has increased severely, also his tics have increased, He can't stop moving he was hitting his feet and head cause his brain is not connecting to his right thoughts. He is high functional autism, I do not recommend this drug to them at all	1	June 10, 2018	14
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Autism	My 7 year old son is on 2mg. It has completely changed our family. He has not broken a window on kicked in a door since starting abilify. Before birth he was exposed to drug, alcohol, violence, chemotherapy, and pain killers. I adopted him at a year. He is diagnosed with  Reactive attachment disorder (RAD) and Asperger Syndrome. He is so calm now. He still gets irritated if things are not his way, but he is does not act on his anger.	10	June 6, 2018	51
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Autism	My son already had looping, fast thoughts that were driving him crazy.  Abilify sped those thoughts up and made it worse.  Couldn't wait for the drug to wear off!	1	June 5, 2018	15
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Autism	This was for my son. The side effects are worse than the original problems.  Extreme weight gain immediately craved food, excessive thirst, already high triglycerides made worse, vision changes immediately.  Trying to get my son off the medication is making the symptoms worse with behavior and insomnia.  He is no longer needing to eat non-stop and he doesn’t use his glasses all day anymore if at all which is how it was before. He has had many almost psychotic episodes screaming that he doesn’t know what he wants to do and completely unable to go to sleep.  He has separation anxiety cannot be alone, increased aggression and work refusal at school. It’s been a month of trying to wean him off. Gradually every step down causes more problems like this.  I highly recommend not trying this drug.  I was pressured into it by the hospital and my ex husband against my wishes.	1	April 28, 2018	13
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Autism	Took them for a year. Didn't really do much and the side effects outweighed the benefits. It started a pattern of new insomnia where I wake up multiple times a night so I went off of it and got really irritating and anxiety triggering dyskenesia. Over a year since I've taken them and the sleep problems have not stopped. It absolutely fried my short term memory. People are always telling me the same thing over and over again because I can't remember things anymore.	4	February 25, 2018	10
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Autism	My 7.5 yrs old son has High Functioning Autism and we had tried 10 different meds in the past almost 3 yrs with zero success.  Finally tried Abilify and it has been a miracle drug.  He eats like crazy but no weight gain but he is super active.  He is so happy most of the time, getting great grades now, and wants to got to school.  What a God send! 2mg at night	10	January 31, 2018	39
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Autism	My 23 year old started Abilify (add on two topamax and zoloft) she had been exhibiting some outbursts and not leaving her apartment.  We only started medicating her when she developed seizures at age 14 and it has been nothing but a series of meds since. I am happy to report that Abilify has seemed to be helpful.  She wants to get out more and hasn't had an outburst in months.	7	August 28, 2017	24
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Autism	My child has been on Abilify for a while now and we have not noticed any changes really. He still has aggression, self injurious behavior, and extreme levels of impulsivity. I can't take him out in public because he randomly hits people especially small children. If he is prevented from harming others he starts hurts himself until we have to restrain him. He has callouses on his wrists from biting and hitting his mouth repeatedly. The doctor has already increased his Abilify up to 10mg twice a day and he's on Clonidine 0.1mg 6 x's a day, Concerta 54mg a day, Ritalin 10mg a day, and Vistarel 100mg a night and melatonin at night. It's like he is on nothing though. I am terrified to take him off because it might make him worse. I'm so lost.	1	May 28, 2017	40
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Autism	After 15 years of suffering from all kind of behaviors and agression we found the best neaouroligist in the world who cured my son from autisum, and it was a cure, if he was able to control the bheavior then he cured him to me. My son took 7. 5 abilify in the morning along with 2500mg of depakin chrono at night he took one 25 mg seroquel and depakin and 0. 25 clonozepam.. My life has changed life is beautiful once you find the right combination .. Abilify is a good medication. I love it	10	March 13, 2017	33
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	Abilify helped with my manic episodes, but gained 15 pounds after a month and spiralled into a horrible depression that saw me in bed for weeks after I tried to come off the drug.  Felt near completely disabled. Not for me.	1	February 17, 2020	23
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	This medication has ruined my self esteem and essentially my life. I have gained 50 lbs from this medication. That wasn’t a typo 50 freaking lbs!!! I’ve recently stopped taking it but no weight has come off yet. I’m beside myself. I don’t know what to do. I hate the way I look now.	1	February 6, 2020	38
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	Be careful, Abilify caused a massive compulsive gambling addiction where I lost tens of thousands over time.  I mentioned it to the doctor early on but she ignored it, didn't note it or change the meds.  Guess I was hooked on the buzz.  Stopped taking Abilify.  Stopped gambling recklessly.  Compulsive gambling addiction is a mental health disorder itself.  Who'd have thought that the NHS would prescribe this dangerous drug that can cause it?  Sounds ridiculous but true.  There was a guy with Parkinsons prescribed it in England, went full on the National Lottery online games and scratch cards etc ... but won his case for not being advised properly of the potential side effects and got most of the losses back.  They don't care for my complaint.    A class action lawsuit is underway in the United States because it wasn't on the label.  Suing a big Japanese pharmaceutical company seems okay.  Lost all interest in work and drifted for 18 months.	2	February 2, 2020	25
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	I am diagnosed with Bipolar 1 and in my 20s suffered through 3 major manic psychotic episodes which led to at least month long hospitalizations each time. After the first episode, I was put on zyprexa in which I felt zombified and depressed on which led me to go off of it entirely. Less than a year later I was hospitalized again and at that point I was introduced to Abilify. Three years passed during which I was stable. I then went off of it which led to my third and final hospitalization. Ever since then I took the 20mg tablets religiously and would soon combine it with Lamictal. This combo has worked wonders for me. Years ago a doctor told me that I’m on the Rolls Royce of bipolar medication and I firmly agree. About a year ago I started taking the 400mg injection which helped me lose at least 30 pounds. I find the injection the most effective method of taking Abilify. It has been a life saver for me!	10	January 25, 2020	56
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	Have been on Abilify (Generic) for about a month now. My lows are higher and my highs are nonexistent. I’m mostly flat emotionally, lacking interest in everything, including people. Good for my irritability and delusions, but the side effects are tough.	5	January 19, 2020	34
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	I am a 24 year old male with Bipolar II. Depression is what I struggle with 98% of the time. I have been taking this med  Abilify for about a month now, so long enough. I switched to this from Zyprexa, and that switch was rough. My anxiety came back worse than before on this med and the restlessness was too much for me. I took 5mg and I would get an hour or two of sleep per day and not be able to sit still during the day. I will say that it cured my depression completely, so for that I am grateful. As far as my anxiety, sleep, and overall mood it has not improved. Moving up in dosage caused more restlessness and moving down to 2.5mg or less made me tired and didn't do much for my mood. This med didn't work for me but its not the worst med, give it a shot. I'm switching to Latuda, wish me luck.	6	January 17, 2020	32
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	I am 31, female with bipolar 1 along with depression (obviously lol), extreme social anxiety and PTDS.  I was on abilify, all the way up to 20mgs at the last year or so.  I truly thought it wasn't working or doing ANYTHING for me anymore, so switched to Latuda.  Well the pharmacy was out of stock of Latuda and I had just finished my taper off of Abilify,  so I was about 4-5 days off of any mood stabilizer.  And now I can say that although it may not have been as effective as when I first went on it, it definitely made a difference!  Since the second week of my taper (down to 5 mg, then 2) I applied for some more credit cards and thought nothing of it.  In the past 2 days, I have maxed out all those credit cards.  It wasn't until last night I put the connection to me not being on anything.  I gained a little weight on it, but at the same time,  I allowed myself to eat what I wanted and didn't exercise.  During the taper, I tried seroquel and abilify is nothing as bad as that weight wise.	8	January 8, 2020	27
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	Ability was the first medication prescribed following my bipolar diagnosis, I was told it had a side effect of weight gain. When I first started it, for 14 days, I was MISERABLE...I couldn't eat, sleep, use the restroom, lay down without fidgeting, focus or stop thinking super fast. But on day 15, all those awful effects disappeared. I never experienced anything bad other that weigh gain.  I had the same side effects weaning off it. (That was 300+ pounds ago. I didn't change my eating or exercising habits) In 2017 my new psychiatrist changed medications and I dropped 41 pounds in two years the Abilify slowed my metabolism.  I mainly noticed how it gave me a sense of controlled well being.  In the 15 years I took it, I only missed two doses. I figured if I did my part, medication and stayed actively involved in my own therapy then life would be best it could.	8	December 18, 2019	33
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	Been on every BiPolar med known.  Finally tried Abilify (generic)  and this  for me, is the VERY BEST bipolar medication in the world.  No highs, no lows, NO bipolar  symptoms at all.  I’ve never known in my 45 years that a bipolar drug could make me feel so “normal”.  Truly happy, level headed and carefree.  Sleep is normal for the first time ever.  I’d rate it an “11” if I could!  CHANGED MY LIFE FOR THE BETTER, literally!  I TAKE aripiprazole 10mg once daily, Prozac as well.	10	December 14, 2019	70
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	"Up until recently, I was taking just 1 mg of Abilify along with 300 mg of Lamictal.  My doctor had me on 2, but I felt like it made me feel apathetic and kind of dissociated, so I began cutting the pill in half.  I did notice that I felt less depressed, could focus better, and did not experience such strong mood episodes.   However, within a month I was experiencing this extremely intense paranoia that I never had before.  I had chest pains and headaches regularly.  I couldn't eat and often felt sick because of how anxious I was.  So yes, Abilify did benefit me alongside this weird side effect.  My doctor had me convinced the medication wasn't causing the paranoia, it was ""just me"", but as soon as I stopped taking it the headaches, chest pains, and bursts of anxiety have stopped.  I do feel more depressed and my mood swings have come back harder.  I'm getting a new doctor soon to hopefully put me on another type of antipsychotic"	4	December 9, 2019	20
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	I had so many horrible experiences with  meds for my bipolar. It scared me to try one more but I'm now on 2mg of abilify once daily and found my old self again after a very long time living an unbearable life. The only side effect is slight insomnia and I'm losing the ton of weight that I gained while on seroquel. Abilify saved my life.		December 5, 2019	45
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	This made me feel absolutely horrible. It gave me worse derealization, anxiety, and anhedonia, worse than I have ever had. I do NOT recommend ever trying this stay away from it!!!	1	December 4, 2019	16
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	I was prescribed Abilify after experiencing a 3-4 month long hypomanic episode. I was on Lamictal 100mg but that wasn’t helping alone so my psychiatrist decided to add in Abilify. She also said it would help with the mild paranoid thoughts I was having. This was a horrible medication for me personally. It may work for other people, but it wasn’t for me. It made me flat and I didn’t care about anything anymore. I wasn’t depressed on it, I just didn’t care about anything. Even the people around me commented on how apathetic I had become. It made my fears of psychiatric medications come true. I lost my personality, passion, and energy. I am off of it now, and feel way better. I think it served its purpose of getting me out of my hypomanic episode, which is why I gave it a 4-star rating, but I couldn’t see being on this medication long-term.	4	November 23, 2019	15
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	On Abilify for Bipolar and it is the first time in my entire life that I have felt stable. I have no side effects from this medication. I take it at night and it makes me a bit sleepy which is good for my sleep anyways. I have tried a few other mood stabilizers without success and finally tried Abilify and it works fantastically for me.	10	October 30, 2019	46
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	I HATE this drug! I have the more depressive side of bipolar disorder and for some reason got put on this antipsychotic instead of antidepressants. I have had irritability followed by flat affect. All of my creativity is gone as is my sex drive. I'm starting to get more and more depressed. My medicines provider keeps saying to wait or cancelling appointments! I'm probably going to taper myself off if things don't get changed soon.	2	October 19, 2019	16
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	I feel like a new woman on Abilify! I have Bi-Polar II, anxiety, depression, and PTSD. I have tried Lithium (gained too much weight and my thyroid went wacky), Lamictal (skin rash) and Topamax (which I currently take 50 mg at night to counteract the possible side effect of weight gain with Abilify). I have NOT gained any weight on Abilify! I was hesitant to take it, and now I’m kicking myself for not starting it sooner because I feel amazing! I have energy, depression and anxiety are GONE, and my bi-polar symptoms have vanished. This is a miracle drug for me! Give it a try if you are questioning it, because I wish I would have tried it sooner! I’m 46 years old and I am 5’10” and weigh 165 pounds with a BMI of 24 (Average).	10	October 18, 2019	69
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	This medication  Abilify almost killed me. I started it in January  for bipolar and felt flat and slightly suicidal (as I had before starting it) for about two months on it. Experienced some weight gain. After the two months, I began to have obsessive suicidal thoughts to the point I couldn't concentrate. Oddly enough, I didn't feel depressed just non-stop suicidal thoughts. I got off of it and switched to lithium, haven't had a suicidal thought in months!	1	October 16, 2019	19
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	I tried to give Abilify a chance three times. I find no interest in activities, not suicidal but don’t feel inspired or a purpose to anything, I just want to be in bed all day and I easily get emotionally hurt or offended. I felt everyone would stare and judge me and so my Doctor kept saying that I would get better after a couple of weeks. The first few days I felt very high and happy, I also had high levels of energy but I couldn’t finish one thing before starting another. I also began to feel extreme panic, I had constant panic attacks, flushing sensation and once I began to lessen the dose to come off I experienced vertigo. I had not felt this before and I was in a panic thinking I had some tumor or had something haywire my nervous system and would never be the same. I stopped in July and it’s now October I still have vertigo but not as intense, I was just prescribed Wellbutrin and I’m really hoping it helps me. Everyone is different but this was my personal experience	3	October 11, 2019	11
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	I took abilify for over 6 years and at first it worked very well. Year 2 I started having face twitching, shakiness and stuttering speech. 3rd year I started with tardive dyskinesia. 4-6 ish years I had all the aforementioned and added falling at least 6 times a day, I was so shaky I could barely walk, plus my memory was shot. I couldn't remember my  phone number or email address I had had for 10 years. New psych took me off and within 2 months almost all of the symptoms were gone. I think some of the shakiness and memory loss are permanent but I have a new lease on life. Poison. Pure poison. I wish I could have those 6 years back.	1	October 4, 2019	25
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	Thank you all so much for your candid feedback!! I needed this for support and better understanding. I sobbed reading every comment, because I can relate.  My 18 year old son has psychosis and mania. Meds just changed. Lithium dropped due to “out of range” high toxicity.  Antipsychotic med. Risperidone, no longer affective after a year. He has been on Abilify for 1 week. After 1 day, I could tell his psychosis was disappearing.  He realized date on the calendar, acted as if he had missed a month of his life. Then immediately jumped back in the game! He showered with soap! His obsessive, fixated thoughts and actions stopped, and he quickly  reprioritized his responsibilities.  Side affects- nausea, sick, no appetite for days.  (Zofran) is helping.  Slightly more aggravated at times, pesters family, a little removed, impulsive and quick to snap. It’s only been a week, so hoping these symptoms stop, and mood levels out. Thank you again for sharing! Love and wellness to all	7	October 2, 2019	26
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	Worked well for 2 years but has been less effective lately.	6	September 24, 2019	14
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	Wow. I took it and many of the reviews here could have been me. Was on it for 3 weeks couldn’t take the side effects. My tongue was  swollen 2x it’s size uncontrollable salivating. Anger outbursts that were uncharacteristic of me, impulsivity, akasthasia horrible kicking legs as I tried to go to sleep. Doc was kind enough to pull me off it as I gained 20 pounds in this month. Ridiculous. It was not a “live saver” for me either. 	1	September 1, 2019	13
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	This drug destroyed my life. My sexual urges became insatiable and my drug use went supersonic. After the dust settled my marriage was destroyed,  I’m broke and my credit rating went 750 to 400. I’ve lost all credibility with my family and friends. I started going sideways almost immediately after I started taking Abilify. I had trembling hands   I cut myself and was very irritable.  I became a different person	1	August 28, 2019	10
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	I've been on Abilify 5mg for 3 weeks now (taking for bipolar). I'm naturally a restless person so I like the feeling of having to do something all the time, It makes me feel like I'm contributing. Sleeping about 5-6 hours a night. Weight gain of about 2lbs. I feel better and a little more connected to my husband and kids as compared to when I was on Quetiapine.	7	August 18, 2019	20
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	Well I've been on for 5 days. I'm a little more chill, but completely lost my ability to have an orgasm :( so...idk  	5	August 12, 2019	19
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	This medicine  Abilify has done wonders for my hallucinations ! They are 3/4 the way gone and I've never felt more stable in my whole life. Earlier when I was just depressed so they added Abilify to my Zoloft.  It did not spark joy at all, made me gain 15 pounds. But a year later I developed psychosis and they gave me Abilify once again. It worked like a miracle this time! I have been on this medication for about 6 months and its been so good, highly, highly recommend this if you are experiencing psychosis!	10	August 7, 2019	26
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	I had commented approximately 2 weeks ago  (under the name:  I hate abilify. on the 2019-07-09) regarding the 400 mg abilify injection. Well I saw my new pdoc on the 18th and she is wonderful!!! I am no longer on the injection due to side effects.  In addition to all of the side effects noted previously, I forgot to mention the major weight gain also.  This drug is NOT WEIGHT NEUTRAL!!  IF YOU ARE CONCERNED ABOUT YOUR WEIGHT MOVE ON TO THE NEXT DRUG.  If you're not happy with your current pdoc find someone you are happy with.  Just because we have bipolar disorder or have a mental illness does not mean we can not control what we ingest into our body.  You have a choice!!! If you have a feeling of being trapped and your pdoc not listening to your concerns, MOVE on!!!! Good luck to all of you.....	1	July 28, 2019	24
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	Helped with mania and depression. Stopped taking due to weight gain and erectile dysfunction.	4	July 19, 2019	6
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	 I am on the 400 mg Abilify injection and I am miserable!  My pdoc is the worst.  She does not listen to anything I have to say about the drug regarding side effects.  I am having muscle spasms as I am typing right now.  I also have dry mouth, constipation, depression and agitation. I had this doctor with tunnel vision ten years ago you think I would have learned my lesson, but I do have an appointment on the 18th with a new proc thank god!!!!   God help us all!!!	1	July 9, 2019	15
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	Abilify levels out my mania like nothing else but does nothing for my depression. Causes regular chest pain, weakness, and awful akathesia. Works for the most part, but I would definitely not recommend due to side effects.	4	July 5, 2019	10
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	The most terrible drug I have ever been put on. Always tired, trouble moving and dizziness. Would not recommend this drug to anyone.	1	June 25, 2019	13
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	A psychiatrist of very questionable competence added Abilify to my antidepressant so that I would have to come back more often for visits (my antidepressant was working fine).  The six weeks that I was on Abilify, I could not sit still in a chair for even five minutes.  All I would do is pace.  I have never been classified as bipolar by anyone but this doctor (major depression - yes) and I lived a nightmare while taking Abilify.  I don't wish this on anyone.  If a doctor suggests that you take this drug, please ask a lot of questions and do some research on your own.	1	June 17, 2019	14
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	I was on this for over 3 years. To start with I thought it was working, the last year I had a racing head and high anxiety. Was discharged from psych so had to fight to get seen again to change medication. Realised a few months after coming off it that my finances had changed shortly after starting Abilify and not in a good way. I was never in debt before Abilify. I am 37 too. I’m in a lot of debt because of Abilify because I started taking out loans shortly after starting it amongst other things. Have since read that the FDA made the manufacturing company to list compulsive shopping, compulsive gambling and other excessive behaviours etc as a side effect in May 2016. I started it in August 2015 so was unaware when I researched this medication when I first went on it. No Dr made me aware of this side effect at any point. Please note I have been manic prior to this medication and had never taken out credit or borrowed money.	1	May 21, 2019	14
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	I have a mood disorder and an anxiety disorder. I’ve been taking Zoloft for ~3 years, and although it helped with anxiety, it didn’t touch my intense mood swings. After a very bad mood swing that almost broke up my 7 year relationship, I sought help. My psychiatrist put me on Lamictal first, and it gave me hives. Then we tried trileptal, and the GI side effects were unbearable after 2 weeks. Finally she put me on Abilify and so far it has been great. I’ve been on 2 mg of Abilify (with 50 mg Zoloft) for a week and there have been almost no side effects. I was warned there might be dry mouth or excessive sweating but I’ve been fine. It did cause me to wake up 7-8 times during the night, but I switched to taking it in the morning and now I sleep like a baby again! It has only been a week but I’m starting to feel a difference: I have more energy and I feel more in control of my moods 	9	May 14, 2019	19
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	Terrible experience. Started on 4 mg then the next day I couldn’t stop puking, had dangerously low blood pressure, and they couldn’t feel a pulse. I’m 19 and this is a relatively low dose to start on. I really think this medicine needs to be recalled because it is so dangerous. I would NOT recommend this drug	1	May 9, 2019	14
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	Abilify works well for my bipolar, it really helped with my reaction to stimulus.	10	May 6, 2019	16
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	Caused extreme hysterical sobbing  and suicidal-level depression after only 3 doses. I had to be hospitalized via ambulance, and spent an additional 2 days sobbing in my hospital room with the curtains closed. I’ve had bipolar II for 22 years, and this was, without a doubt, the most nightmarish emotional experience I have ever had.	1	April 19, 2019	11
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	Of all the conditions this medication treats it seems that the lowest reviews come from people, like myself, who have bipolar disorder. I came to this site to read other reviews to see if what I’ve been feeling was somehow related to Abilify. I’m glad I read some of the reviews because now I don’t feel as crazy.   My new psychiatrist was so confident that this medication would work that I’ve been convincing myself to ignore the things that were off but now it’s just unbearable. I am naturally very emotional and before this medication I absolutely hated it but now that I basically feel emotionless I want off of this medication.   I’m envious of how this has been a miracle drug for a lot of people but for me it’s been fogginess, no appetite and just a general feeling “blah”. I also stumble over my words a lot and my creativity feels stifled by it. I’m calling my psychiatrist tomorrow and getting off of this stuff.	1	April 15, 2019	9
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	I took this for three months and it caused me to gain 40+ pounds	1	December 11, 2018	17
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	I’ve tried every mood stabilizer, typical psychotic and atypical antipsychotic for my Aspergers and Bipolar depression, and Abilify always helps the most.  I feel happy on it and it helps me with dysphoric mania consistently.  It does cause weight gain, but I have been able to lose weight on it by cutting calories to 1500 a day and walking regularly.  Plus, it has a generic version now, so it’s cheap!	8	November 30, 2018	23
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	I was started on Abilify  as a mood stabilizer for Bipolar I manic episodes . I was afraid to take it at first (as I am with all meds), but I took 1/4 of the pill days 1-2. Felt no I’ll effects except tiredness. Took 1/2 pill for 2 weeks. Noticed immediately my mood levelled out. Still made me tired at night. Groggy in the morning but wore off as the day went on. Now, on a whole 5mg and so far it has been wonderful! I feel so much happier and levelled off with my moods. I feel normal. It’s fantastic! It still makes me tired when I first take it at night (so I can sleep finally), but the early morning grogginess is much better. Used to last all morning. Now lasts maybe an hour. Love it!!	10	October 28, 2018	21
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	I was once told by a man online that serotonin and dopamine our happy feel good neurotransmitters. And that to contain my bipolar volatility my doctor was turning down the volume. Side effect. I have no get up n go. My head was once a storm.. now a glassy lake. But there is no wind. No sound. No nothing anymore. I feel empty. Numb. Tired, weak, never sad, never happy. Just flat. I’m tapering off of all antipsychotics and moving onto lithium orotate. Life could be so much better. 	2	October 25, 2018	25
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	This drug made my life miserable, dumbed me down, made me like a zombie. Hardly any thoughts or expression & then the Big one..I couldn’t sit down! The side effect Akathisia, which is intense restlessness. sounds like no big deal but it was an everyday, every minute struggle I suffered horribly! I’d walk down the street to pass time I’d count hours till the day was over, I literally couldn’t sit down, I sat to eat and had to stand back up as soon as I stopped chewing. I smoked cigarettes for 8 years and I tried to quit every Sunday, turns out that one treatment for Akathisia is nicotine. My doc never picked up on it and I was taking Abilify so long I thought it was just what I had become. When I went off of Abilify I could live again. In almost every way. Not only can I sit down in peace but I can think clearly. I didn’t realize how much it was DUMBING ME DOWN. Don’t take this Just work on yourself, take other meds. This medication is like a mild lobotomy. Not worth it	1	October 24, 2018	21
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	I am a 42 year old woman and  diagnosed with Bipolar and ADHD.  I highly recommend this medication. I was at 10mg and it rescued me from a manic episode that was so bad that I was psychotic. It not only cleared that right up, but it improved my concentration. I did suffer from minor akethesia.  I was able to control it without a problem.  However, three years later, I have gained a lot of weight. I am now taking 5mg and monitoring with my doc. After a month, the weight is coming off, but I am now hypomanic...a beautiful yet scary place to be.  Where to go from here, I’m not sure.	7	October 21, 2018	16
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	I felt like a different person. I felt weird, socially with drawn, and introverted. I had fogginess in the back of my head. I had no appetite or sex drive. I had shaky legs and hands. I was up all night. I would have times where my eyes were out of focus and I couldn’t see straight. Please do not take this medication. Everybody is different but my experience was horrible. As I stopped taking it, these side effects are going away. I couldn’t function or do simple tasks.	1	October 3, 2018	19
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	Hello, I will love to share My experience with this medication. My name is Tay, and I was diagnosed with Bipolar disorder with major mood swings affecting my daily life such as work. I tried Abilify 10 mg and it make me feel like the living dead, no energy feeling tired and really bad increase of anxiety and feeling paranoid. I was then lowered the dosage to 5mg, however is still make me tired and increased of anxiety. My physician does not want to take me off of it. I really do not wish to proceed with this medication. I stopped taking it without letting my doctor know. I really hope to tried something else Thanks	1	October 2, 2018	18
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	I've had unexpected benefits with this drug.  For one I am hypoglycemic, and this tends to keep my sugars normal.  Plus when I'm off meds I tend to drink to keep my mind under control-thats a bad thing since I have gastritis.  I had been off it for about two weeks and drank last night and was up half the night with my stomach.  I'm not an alcoholic, have discussed my drinking habits with the doctor, they are not concerned.  But I have started my meds today again because of my stomach.  I love being unmedicated, but this helps me control my thoughts and I don't tend to get out of control on it.  So yes, works 10/10 for me.  I like latuda a little better than this med, but due to cost I'll stick with this one for now.	10	September 29, 2018	11
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	Gave me extremely painful full-body cramps after a week.	1	September 29, 2018	2
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	After a few weeks it had me unsettled and tapping my feet 90 miles and hour  It made me nervous  I went down on my dosage to 7.5 and I’m better but want off of it  I’m just without personality and I feel like there’s something better I could take	3	July 13, 2018	12
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	Started taking with vistaril after a hospitalization. First caused stomach upset, nausea, and headache. But now nothing! I’m waaaay more stable and focused. I get sleepy in the afternoon because I take my meds at noon with lunch.	9	June 24, 2018	10
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	This drug was initially good at mitigating some aspects of mania for me. It also made me feel less anxious and I cared less about what others thought of me for a few months. The drug seemed to loose its effectiveness and my psychiatrist said it may have been amplifying self harm thoughts. For these reasons I give it a 5/10. I am now on risperidol.	5	June 12, 2018	7
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	It did not stabilize my moods. I’m still all over the place, and the fact that I can’t sit still get really under my nerves. I’m super paranoid on this. I feel 10x worse than I did before. It messed me up completely. Side Effects: Severe akathisia, High anxiety, Paranoia, Delusions, Mania, Depression, Suicidal Ideation. I only took this for 2 weeks at a low dose of 5mg and I'M DONE.	3	June 5, 2018	19
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	Horrible experience with Abilify. Was like taking speed, but in a really inefficient mess of a way. Could not keep on top of my work, would start a million things and finish none. Stopped after less than a week of use.	2	May 17, 2018	11
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	Weight gain and depression	4	May 13, 2018	10
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	I have a love-hate relationship with this drug. On one hand, it immediately stopped my paranoid thoughts and delusions and made me feel normal again.. mentally. On the other hand, it gave me this unshakable restless and irritated energy. I wasn't able to sit still, complete anything I loved, or even listen to friends. If you don't mind feeling like you have to run a marathon an hour this might work for you.	5	April 18, 2018	11
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	I was on abilify for a diagnosis of mixed bipolar disorder and generalized anxiety disorder  following a hospitalization. I was on it for about a year . I found it helpful, and easily tolerated at first - it helped reduce hallucinations and paranoia while improving my fluctuating mood. However, even at its highest dose, it wasn’t strong enough or potent enough for me I suppose - it just didn’t match up. I continued to have some paranoia and whenever I was more upset than usual, I’d have breakthrough hallucinations. What made the docs take me off of it was the oral twitching I developed and bizarre tongue movements, which are signs of tardive dyskinesia, a rare side effect. Newer antipsychotics have less instances of this condition, but it’s still possible. Anyway, I was taken off of it and placed on another antipsychotic. Still have tongue movements though... An overall okay drug, it works for a lot of people, but not everyone!	8	March 27, 2018	7
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	I have been on abilify since Sept 2017. I haven't gained weight, no side effects so far and no anxiety. This drugs helps me to focus and concentrate. It also keeps my moods stable. I take this with lithium 1200mg and seroquel 100mg for sleep. Hopefully it keeps on working.	8	January 31, 2018	11
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	I've suffered from Bipolar 2 and GAD and ADD for 15 yrs now. I take Lamictal, Effexor XR, Abilify and Adderall.  Not until I started Abilify 3 weeks ago have I had any improvement with energy levels and depression. I have treatment resistant depression and my anxiety causes me to not be able to work and I barely want to leave the house. But since starting Abilify, I feel almost fantastic. I wake up early ready to start my day. And I've never been a morning person. I'm more positive about my life and I am even thinking about getting a job. I haven't worked in 6 years. But I do have problems staying asleep . I mean, its 3:06am and I am wide awake writing this. So yeah, restless sleep. And the sexual side effects aren't good. Total lack of interest which is difficult when you're in a relationship. But I'm not willing to stop this medication.The good far outweighs the bad in so so many ways. Good luck to all and give this med a try		January 31, 2018	18
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	One day and done. I've never experienced side effects like this before. I took it before bed and then was up every few hours, restless, mind racing. Finally I shot up at 4am and NEEDED to shower. While in there my head was so heavy, I couldn't stand any more. I had to rest my head. Then I got so nauseated I started to dry heave. Now I'm heavy headed, blurry, dizzy, restless, & afraid to stand up or drive. I will never take this drug again.		January 18, 2018	16
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	I took it once which made a horrible experience for myself. I woke up from a nap and I had double vision, nausea, vomiting and fainted because of Abilify.	1	December 30, 2017	8
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	I'm not sure what mental issues I have exactly, they've told me this and that over the past 15 years. I got people talking going on and seeing them. I also have anger outbursts and take things out on myself, but doesn't happen when I hear and see the people. So anyway, I tried Risperdal before from my doc and it helped me to be able to read and understand what I read, but with Abilify it's not as good, although Risperdal made me have gynecomastia big time, and Abilify doesn't cause as much prolactin. I think it's a decent medication, but the voices and seeing people are still strong and break through the veil, even the mask of the medication, so I'm not cured. But it's better than nothing I guess. But one day I may go off of it.	7	December 2, 2017	4
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	This drug has been a lifesaver to me. It's helped provide me with mood stability with an antidepressant effect, whereas lithium only controlled the mania part of my mood. I use this in combination with other drugs  and so far there hasn't been any side effects. I tried decreasing the dosage, and within 2 days I noticed a difference in my mood. I would definitely recommend this drug. This has made a difference in my mood, the way I think, and my overall perspective. This improved my motivation to get work done, since I wouldn't be just sitting around reminiscing in a negative thought loop. It gives me mental freedom and allows me to escape brain fog that has imprisoned my thoughts. Seriously, don't be afraid to try this drug	9	November 27, 2017	25
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	Was put on Abilify to control hypomania. I'm very, very sensitive to pretty much every medication. Initial I had a stomach ache that only lasted one night and some tiredness the first two days. However... After this I had severe hypomania and restlessness that just didn't go away. It wasn't akasteisia though. Unfortunately I can't reach the mood stabilizing effect - being at least 10 mg - since I can't go any higher than 1.25 mg without having side effects such as emotional numbness, numbness of my face, twitching, increased eye blinking - which of course scares me since there is a risk of Tardive Dyskinesia. It's definitely a very powerfull drug. BUT it really did help my depression and anxiety, just didn't help control my hypomania. LOL	3	October 23, 2017	9
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	"The medication, at first, did was it was supposed to do. I was a shut in with some paranoia thrown in and hadn't left my house in over a year, except to go to doctors appointments and get groceries in the house. At first I found the medication got me out and about and got me back into the real world. I signed up for college, got in contact with friends I hadn't talked with in ages, and started living again. For that, this drug was fine. Then the side effects started kicking in. Keep in mind I was on 2mg of this drug and even then the side effects were bad enough to knock me OUT of college and suffer something called ""Depersonalization through Disassociation"". One of the scariest experiences I think I've ever had. I don't recommend it."	3	October 20, 2017	15
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	This medication was the worst experience of my life and I've been through a lot of rubbish.  I experienced insomnia depression anxiety and pesudo ME on abilify. I was on it for 3 months and I spent my time feeling lobotomised and wanting to give up on life. It took me 3 months to fully get back to my old self. Going between depressed and manic. I found a medication that works for me with out professional help afterwards.	1	September 30, 2017	11
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	When I first starting taking abilify, I was about 14 and a half and 130 pounds, and it worked great. My mood was great, side effects were minimal. However, over the course of about a year I have gained almost 60 pounds, and that was while playing two varsity sports and a club sport that whole time, so I was active majority of that time. When I came off it recently, I lost about 10 pounds over two weeks, but I was much worse than I was before I went on it, (which I find weird), so I was put back on. It is impossible to get the weight to go away.	2	September 30, 2017	9
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	I got extreme manic symptom after I used Abilify for one month. I feel very anxious and scared about everything. I have an illusion energy which leads me push up double times more than no medication usage, but I feel very weak and extreme anxiety in the next few days. It increases my distance between up and down emotion very far away, but the distance between up and down emotion should be neutral. After I withdraw all of them carefully with herbal sleeping pills for alternative, my distant emotion becomes shorter which changes to be neutral condition. When my emotion and mood become neutral, my excessive emotional reaction no longer appear anymore.		September 19, 2017	6
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	I was given this medicine by a regular medical doctor in tandem with Prozac and Ambien.  What a horrible combo!!!!  After being on Abilify for several weeks every nerve ending in my body felt like they were on fire.  I was hyper and couldn't stay seated.  I found out that this medicine was burning my brain and causing Akathisia.   I called my doctor and told him what was going on and he wanted to double the milligram.  I said....ohhhhhhhh no your not!!!!!  Because of this medicine combo things got so bad I tried suicide back in February of 2015.  I took 13 sleeping pills. The hospital doctor in the psych ward said the combination I was on was wrong and he was surprised I wasn't in the hospital earlier !!!	1	August 30, 2017	11
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	I give Abilify the highest rating. I'm a 42 year old female with PTSD, Bipolar Depression, ADHD. I have tried every anti-depressant out there, from Amoxapine to Zyprexa, in which I experienced some extremely negative side effects from.  So, needless to say, I am rather reluctant when having to start taking a medication that I've never tried before.  (I've been taking 60mg of Prozac (fluoxetine) daily for the past several years). As of late, I've been experiencing increased symptoms in my bipolar depression.  My doctor prescribed Abilify 5mg about 2 months ago.  I have noticed such a positive change in myself. After only about 5-7 days of taking Abilify did I start to notice a change in my mood, attitude, outlook on life. It's been great!		August 17, 2017	17
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	It's just silence in my head, its hard to think. I don't have schizophrenia. I just can't really think clearly. All night I stayed up dizzy and nauseous but I'm gonna continue the medicine in hopes that it loosens up and keeps me mellow headed. After the initial nausea I felt pretty chill.   (If it gets better I will keep you guys updated.)	4	August 4, 2017	7
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	I had a bad time with this drug. It worked on my mood, but whenever I stood up, I got dizzy. I fell down the stairs once. Plus even with insurance, it's really expensive.	3	August 2, 2017	6
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	I like this medication, but it causes my prolactin levels to go up. Which in turn cause my breast to leak milky fluid. Dr said he thinks it is from Invega injection. I just cannot take this side effect	6	July 11, 2017	4
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	I have been on this for three days. The first day was horrific and I was definitively going to quit. I felt more trapped and traumatized by the 'problem things' I am dealing with than ever. The weird thing is I  liked my psychiatrist but I felt the drug was killing me. I was horrified by some of the things I am dealing with but now three days later I feel it is starting to balance things out and put me in a humored mood from my 'problems' rather than a traumatized one. I swore off of all psychiatric pills for the past fourteen years, but decided to give it another shot. In the big picture, I think it is the right decision, but it is making me worrisomely hungry.		June 26, 2017	8
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	I didn't notice a big difference on Ablify. I feel more level headed but also I feel more indecisive, dizzy and restlessness. I was on 10 mg for 3 months and the restlessness was so bad I couldn't sit still.	5	June 26, 2017	13
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	I've been prescribed ability and loxapac for a manic episode on May 19th for slightly more than three weeks. It worked well but early June I started to feel unable to sit  still at some places. Around June 10th I had terrible anxiety and panic attacks, it was pure torture, so back to the institution. Had to wait two days until a doctor showed up , gave me something that stopped it all and removed the two drugs. It might be loxapac. Fact is, since then, there is another torture. Akathisia in the form of wanting to walk all the time. It's been one week now and thanks god it stops at night. I want to live (I'm not even 20)  I pray it stops fast  l've suffered enough. I really hate Abilify or Loxapac	1	June 19, 2017	4
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	Started taking Abilify in August of 2016. The day after I wanted to drink. I'm a recovering alcoholic, called my physciatrist and she switched seroquel to Thorazine. And I got over the next couple of days. I just received an inheritance somehow I ended up with 191 Groupons, online shopping I couldn't have controlled so much in an amnesia state. Wouldn't have known this was happening. Went to Dr and hospitals 8 or 9 times with different things of Abilify! I had an suicide attempt in March. I stayed awake for 4 days afterwards. I've wrecked my car 4 times. I have TD and Akatasia now. I've never had a drug complicate me as much!   I was also severely anorexic.	1	June 15, 2017	4
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	I have bipolar II, cycle up in spring and major depressive in the fall. I have tried lamictal, great drug but got the rash, geodon, ok but felt like I was drunk, latuda, got the jaw pain whitch was awful. Ability seems to help with the overwhelming agitation I get in the spring time. I hope it is as good in the fall for my depression phase.	8	May 15, 2017	10
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	I've been on abilify for almost a month the only side effect I have is waking up in the middle of the night a few times I have actually lost 12 pounds I am eating good and drinking plenty of water so I'm sure that helps I'm also on Zoloft and topamax all in all it's a much better drug than my previous geodon I would recommend it	6	May 12, 2017	12
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	After taking anti-psychotic medications for 9 years and trying just about every single one of  them, I have finally found one that is working for me, at this point in my life. I started this medication  (Abilify) nearly 4 months ago and the positive changes I’ve seen in my life make me so happy. I have  lost almost 30 pounds within these last several months, I have been more active with my children, and I  actually get off the couch and walk and enjoy life. I’ve been involved with my “FitBit” challenges which I  would’ve never attempted to even think about doing before. My manic episodes are very rare and less  erratic. Before when I would be on a anti-psychotic  medication I would feel like I was in a “zombie mode” barely functioning day by day. The only downfall I have with this medication (Abilify), which is a side effect, is if I get up to  quickly I get dizzy and just collapse. Now I’m at a plateau with my weight, but I’m not gaining weight  either. I give this Anti-Psychotic Medication a 9 out of 10.	9	April 28, 2017	32
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	Excellent. Depression lifted fast. Stabilizes my mood very well, as a bonus I spontaneously los 55 lbs! All that weight came from Seroquel and Zyprexa. Con, has a negative effect on sleep, I need melatonin to be able to sleep. Also my blood pressure is suddenly a lot lower, 102/63 causing some light headedness during the day.  It's however the first med that is able to stabilize my mood very well with very acceptable side effects.	8	April 17, 2017	25
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	I'm not an easy patient, unsatisfied with the weight gain from the typical atypicals, lacking an 'oomph' from lithium, allergic to lamotrgine and anti-depressants give me a one way ticket to the manic rollercoaster.   I started Abilify and within 3 days I was hypermanic and nauseous to boot. No sleep, spending $400 on some bed sheets seemed like a marvellous idea, thrill seeking etc and throwing up every 3 hours.   However my psychiatrist guided me through it with sleep meds and something to settle the stomach and I'm so glad I pushed through.   Yeah, the restlessness is an issue but I'd like to consider myself an 'experience and going out' person now. Anything better than the listlessness of depression or meds that are supposed to cure it.	9	April 4, 2017	19
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	I have rapid-cycling bipolar and have been on Abilify for a little over 7-8 months. At first, I was on the Abilify by its self and I experienced worsened anxiety and depression. I was thinking about switching drugs after a few weeks of these negative feelings not going away, so my Pdoc added Zoloft to my mix. This combination was a life saver for me. I would definitely recommend using Abilify as an add-on. My mania is manifested as rage, impulsiveness, and rapid negative thoughts in my head and Abilify stopped that for me. The only negative side effect I have now is weight gain. I've only gained 8 pounds, but I have to ignore my food cravings.	8	March 27, 2017	13
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	I took this med for 2 weeks.   Within 3 days I was in full thrown into full a total manic state.  I was awake every night by 3am because I couldn't sleep.  I spent quite a significant amount of money in a short amount of time!  I also put 4 pounds on in this time.  The only positive thing I can say is that it gave me energy.  The reason my pdoc tried me on it was depression and lack of energy.  I also have bipolar and have been on Lithium for 3 years and have been steady until I took Abilify. Needless to say I have stopped taking this med.	3	March 26, 2017	7
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	I have been on abilify for 6 weeks now and am still experiencing anxiety, agitation, constipation. I also feel sedated although I feel like I can't sit still.	5	March 24, 2017	15
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	"I started Abilify because my bipolar disorder drug cocktail became less effective. Abilify was new on the market. It lifted my mood considerably, I felt great. And without any bad side effects. I thought.  After about 6 weeks I developed hand tremor. It got worse. My psychopharmacologist sent me to a neurologist who began treating me for a kind of tremor that's inherited. He did not believe it was due to Abilify- which now has a side effect listed as ""muscle movements that could become permanent."" Naturally I stopped taking Abilify. So either the neurologist is right, and Abilify activated the tremor or I developed the permanent muscle movement side effect. Either way, I now have to take an anti-tremor drug."	1	March 23, 2017	10
Abilify Maintena (injection)	Bipolar Disorder	Abilify Maintena is the only medication that works for my bipolar I. The only noticeable side effect is decreased libido. Great for people like me who are not med compliant with pills.	9	February 2, 2021	3
Abilify Maintena (injection)	Bipolar Disorder	TOTAL MISERY FROM ABILIFY INJECTION 400 DOSE!  I had to find somewhere to sleep all day and then slept all night too! I immediately gained in 30 days, 30 lbs- they have gone straight to my waistline!  Abilify is the worst ever medication! My diagnosis- bi-polar disorder & schizoaffective disorder.  I was forced into a mental hospital, told that if I refused the meds, I wouldn't be released for 30 days and I could be released in 14 days if I consented. I didn't know there was an injection  too!  I would  have just waited it out had I known the ill effect that the Abilify injection 400 time release would have on my endocrine system!Totally ruined my lipids	1	August 25, 2020	13
Abilify Maintena (injection)	Bipolar Disorder	Been taking this injection Abilify Maintena for the past five months and have had no side effects. I started taking the pill form (with no side affects), but I get stubborn and ambitious and stop taking my meds. Plus, it’s sucks to take pills everyday. This has help dramatically. My mood is significantly better and, after many years (over five), I’ve finally stabilized. I see my doctor once a month and she gives me the shot. Only downside is the price. There are many ways to get around that though... just communicate with your doctor. I highly recommend this for treatment resistant depression and mood swings. Saved my life!	9	June 25, 2020	21
Abilify Maintena (injection)	Bipolar Disorder	I’ve been given this drug 300mg by depot every month & am on a community treatment order, which means if I refuse I get taken straight into hospital. It stops psychosis in bipolar but comes at a price, no emotions, extreme tiredness sleeping 12-14 hrs a night so hard to work. I’ve lost my creative side, my sex drive, even my ability to cook. I just sit in a chair most of the time, gaining weight, I feel so sorry for my family, I’ve completely lost myself and the psychiatrist doesn’t seem to care..	2	November 13, 2019	21
Abilify Maintena (injection)	Bipolar Disorder	Abilify 400mg injection at first made me so anxious and felt suicidal. My Dr's said it wasn't the drug it was my depression and anxiety. They persisted with it, as I'm not compliant with tablets. I have bipolar 1 with psychosis. It has helped with psychosis but the side affects are destroying me. Extreme lethargy and total numbness, physically, mentally and emotionally. It has made me gain weight also despite daily exercise. I have no libido whatsoever anymore.  When I complain to the psychiatrist  they just say it's not supposed to do that, there must be another reason for these things. I also feel like I have no memory but have  impulses to gamble and spend money. I have no energy to fight anymore, it's so sad and disgusting that my quality of life is not a factor to these people. Dr's etc.  As long as I'm not in the ward is all that matters to them.	4	October 13, 2019	17
Abilify Maintena (injection)	Bipolar Disorder	Major weigh gain. I feeling tired all the time, but on the other hand my moods have been completely stable. Except for focus which I was prescribed concerta for. It seems to be working :)	7	October 9, 2019	5
Abilify Maintena (injection)	Bipolar Disorder	I have been diagnosed with comorbid bipolar2 and ADHD.  It has been such a struggle, trying different cocktails. The reason I give abilify a 5, is because it had treated my bipolar2, have not had any manic episodes within the past 5 months I’ve received the 400mg injection, however I am started to feel that numb and empty feeling again (no sex drive and not many pleasant emotions either). It’s so miserable, I wish it was a faster process instead of having to wait until my next doctors appointment to tell him to take me off of this or at least lower my dose. From previous experience I do not stop a medication without consulting my doctor and I would highly recommend doing the same as it can lead to detriment in your life if you have manic episodes such as myself.  Right now though, I wish I could just stop it so I have more energy. I’m also on lamictal and Dexedrine. I won’t give up, and I hope that those of you struggling can remain resilient in your search for a cure.	5	August 25, 2019	6
Abilify Maintena (injection)	Bipolar Disorder	Before Abilify I was in and out of the hospital for years. They had me on olanzapine and it made me feel like a slug so I would stop taking it and end up back in the hospital because of manic attacks. They finally suggested this med for me and it has really worked! I don't feel manic, I can think clearly, I feel normal emotions and I have a decent amount of energy. The only side effect I had was that it made me feel sick for the first month every morning. It has really worked for me but you have a give it a month for it to actually work if you are on it.	8	August 3, 2019	13
Abilify Maintena (injection)	Bipolar Disorder	This stuff is ugly, it numbs all feelings and desires, I sleep for about 12 to 14 hours. The weight gain is crazy, sexual side effects too, I took this stuff for a year and a half, then stopped cold turkey, with no problem...I wouldn't recommend this Abilify Maintena or ever take it agin	1	July 10, 2019	16
Abilify Maintena (injection)	Bipolar Disorder	Starting in 2003 I have had problems. By 2009 it increased and my family finally took it serious when I tried to jump out of my mother's vehicle. 2012 I saw a new psychiatrist who finally got me stable on Abilify Maintena 400mg dose. It has been a miracle drug for me. Side effects suck but I can deal with the weight gain I guess. To counteract the fatigue I also take nuvugil and vyvance which I can sleep through these drugs that is how strong the fatigue is. But I am functional, happy, and no crazy wild thoughts. If I do have them they are not as strong and I tend to just shrug them off. I can tell the shot is working because at the end of the month I start getting irritable and sad and immediately when I take it I feel better. Oddly enough I cannot take abilify by pill form because it causes akathesia. I have tried every psychiatric drug there is and nothing has gotten me to where I am today expect Abilify Maintena	10	June 13, 2019	11
Abilify Maintena (injection)	Bipolar Disorder	I've been on abilify maintena for 3 days.  I already feel better after being on paliperidone depot which made me depressed anxious and I had had dark  thought patterns.  Abilify has to be the better medication I've tried, I was diagnosed with bipolar in 2009.	8	February 3, 2019	7
Abilify Maintena (injection)	Bipolar Disorder	So where to begin. I love how this drug completely turned my life around in a really positive way. Used to have multiple manic episodes a year. I haven't had one in over a year after being on this drug. The reason I'm giving this an 8 as its incredibly effective as a mood stabilizer but it makes you too stable to the point of feeling numb at a high dose. Some minor weight gain thats slowly going away, and akathisia which is also slowly going away. I hope that the anhedonia will also slowly back off over time. Lets see. If I had to take this or be unstable I would take this. Also starting this was a nightmare as it made me incredibly agitated before it eventually stabilized my mood.	8	February 2, 2019	8
Abilify Maintena (injection)	Bipolar Disorder	This is my story. 20 years ago I developed clinical depression possibly bipolar. That was bad enough but the change in brain chemistry plunged me into immediate/overnight alcoholism.   Nothing worked for 20 years. This drug cured my alcoholism.  I am a normal drinker now.  I have no idea why this drug cured my alcoholism but it did.	10	January 19, 2018	10
Abilify Maintena (injection)	Bipolar Disorder	It's not for me 6 weeks on and cannot wait till it's out my system. Makes me feel  like I can't  stay in one place too long. It has ruined my sleep and has made me unsocial. I am not saying it's a bad drug just not for me......	1	January 8, 2018	12

Abiraterone	Prostate Cancer	My husband was diagnosed with advanced prostate cancer nearly 2 yrs ago. It had spread to his pelvis and lower back.

Abiraterone	Prostate Cancer	Diagnosed 5 months ago with Prostate Cancer, Stage 4, with Gleason 10, bone Mets almost everywhere. Had radiation to save femur neck and hip involvement. 10 treatments with lupron every 3 months and daily Zytiga and prednisone since diagnosis, I went from a psa 60 to .01. All other numbers thankfully good as well. Side effects have been somewhat cumulative: manageable fatigue, muscle loss and 14 lb weight gain around my waist. Through it all I walk about 30-35 hilly extra miles per week, and lift light to medium weights 2-3 days per week.  74 yrs old. Biggest challenge  is maintaining muscle strength and combatting malaise. Weight work is absolutely essential for me.  I try hard to stay focussed and not take a nap til the afternoon. Then a cup of tea and find a chore. Helps fight depression by accomplishing some little thing. All in all, Zytiga a miracle drug for me.	10	July 25, 2020	16

Abiraterone	Prostate Cancer	Started taking 1000mg of Zytiga almost 3 weeks ago but having difficulty with weakness and pain in legs; it got so bad I was unable to walk.  I was also extremely tired, but not sure if that is from Zytiga or morphine I need to take also.  My prostate cancer found in Feb 2011, Gleason score 9/10; prostate removed May 2011; radiation in 2014, then tumor found in 2018.  Started Lupron in 2019.  My PSA score was never above 4.0 even prior to surgery when it was in 75% of prostate and had spread outside my prostate in several places.  Hoping to switch to another medication that has fewer side effects for me.  I am only 65.	1	May 13, 2020	8
Abiraterone	Prostate Cancer	Started on Xtandi with 4 pills.  After 6 months, broke out into rashes and had trouble standing at the knees due to Xtandi.  Now on Zytiga for 3 months. Had dry skin around neck and hands.  Took skin cream which knocked down the dry skin.  Starting to have knee problems again. Xtandi and Zytiga both weaken your bones.  PSA dropped from 17 to 3.7.  Had Prostate Cancer for about 13 years.	8	April 21, 2020	14
Abiraterone	Prostate Cancer	I was diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer in March of 2017. My PSA was at 23. After taking 6 chemo treatments and hormone shots my PSA went to .05. It gradually went up slightly to .27 and that’s when I went on zytiga. That was in January of 2019 and my psa immediately went to less than .03. After nearly 12 months my psa is holding steady at< .03. All with no side effects!   it’s working for me!	10	December 19, 2019	27
Abiraterone	Prostate Cancer	I am 69. Was diagnosed with prostate cancer 10 months ago with PSA of 68%. I had the MRI which showed that the cancer had metastasised. Oncologist recommended Zytiga but, where I live (Hong Kong) it costs about HK$30,000 per month. Can't afford that.  A medical friend suggested I try India. I did a lot of research and asked friends in India for recommendations and found a supplier at a good price for the generic.  I have been taking the generic (Arbiterone - 4x250 micrograms  +2 tabs of Predisnone per day) for the last six months.  Within two months my PSA was down to 9% and was still at that level three months ago. Side effects – hot flashes, night sweating, and weight-gain. Urologist suggested Clonidine for the hot flashes – worked really well. I see my doctor again in three weeks' time. He is looking into Olaparib (also called Lynparza) and Ivermectin for me.	9	October 17, 2019	26

Abiraterone (Oral)	Prostate Cancer	Diagnosed 5 months ago with Prostate Cancer, Stage 4, with Gleason 10, bone Mets almost everywhere. Had radiation to save femur neck and hip involvement. 10 treatments with lupron every 3 months and daily Zytiga and prednisone since diagnosis, I went from a psa 60 to .01. All other numbers thankfully good as well. Side effects have been somewhat cumulative: manageable fatigue, muscle loss and 14 lb weight gain around my waist. Through it all I walk about 30-35 hilly extra miles per week, and lift light to medium weights 2-3 days per week.  74 yrs old. Biggest challenge  is maintaining muscle strength and combatting malaise. Weight work is absolutely essential for me.  I try hard to stay focussed and not take a nap til the afternoon. Then a cup of tea and find a chore. Helps fight depression by accomplishing some little thing. All in all, Zytiga a miracle drug for me.	10	July 25, 2020	16

Abiraterone (Oral)	Prostate Cancer	Started taking 1000mg of Zytiga almost 3 weeks ago but having difficulty with weakness and pain in legs; it got so bad I was unable to walk.  I was also extremely tired, but not sure if that is from Zytiga or morphine I need to take also.  My prostate cancer found in Feb 2011, Gleason score 9/10; prostate removed May 2011; radiation in 2014, then tumor found in 2018.  Started Lupron in 2019.  My PSA score was never above 4.0 even prior to surgery when it was in 75% of prostate and had spread outside my prostate in several places.  Hoping to switch to another medication that has fewer side effects for me.  I am only 65.	1	May 13, 2020	8
Abiraterone (Oral)	Prostate Cancer	Started on Xtandi with 4 pills.  After 6 months, broke out into rashes and had trouble standing at the knees due to Xtandi.  Now on Zytiga for 3 months. Had dry skin around neck and hands.  Took skin cream which knocked down the dry skin.  Starting to have knee problems again. Xtandi and Zytiga both weaken your bones.  PSA dropped from 17 to 3.7.  Had Prostate Cancer for about 13 years.	8	April 21, 2020	14
Abiraterone (Oral)	Prostate Cancer	I was diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer in March of 2017. My PSA was at 23. After taking 6 chemo treatments and hormone shots my PSA went to .05. It gradually went up slightly to .27 and that’s when I went on zytiga. That was in January of 2019 and my psa immediately went to less than .03. After nearly 12 months my psa is holding steady at< .03. All with no side effects!   it’s working for me!	10	December 19, 2019	27
Abiraterone (Oral)	Prostate Cancer	I am 69. Was diagnosed with prostate cancer 10 months ago with PSA of 68%. I had the MRI which showed that the cancer had metastasised. Oncologist recommended Zytiga but, where I live (Hong Kong) it costs about HK$30,000 per month. Can't afford that.  A medical friend suggested I try India. I did a lot of research and asked friends in India for recommendations and found a supplier at a good price for the generic.  I have been taking the generic (Arbiterone - 4x250 micrograms  +2 tabs of Predisnone per day) for the last six months.  Within two months my PSA was down to 9% and was still at that level three months ago. Side effects – hot flashes, night sweating, and weight-gain. Urologist suggested Clonidine for the hot flashes – worked really well. I see my doctor again in three weeks' time. He is looking into Olaparib (also called Lynparza) and Ivermectin for me.	9	October 17, 2019	26

Unsuccessful cryosurgery followed by rapid PSA elevation to 163 with (+) nodes found on CT scan. Started LHRH-agonist plus Zytiga. After four months, by PSA has dropped to 0.3......good stuff......	10	August 23, 2018	43

Abiraterone (Oral)	Prostate Cancer	My birthdate 17.09.1944 Diagnosed with Metastasic Prostate Cancer Stage 4 since February 2015.

After first four weeks PSA dropped from 101 to 5.8 and after 8 weeks of initial date PSA dropped to 0.66. Today I feel very healthy exactly three years with the greatest consideration for Abiraterone Acetate. Very powerful chemo drug.	10	March 15, 2018	62
Abiraterone (Oral)	Prostate Cancer	Between zytiga and hormone injections, the spread of my cancer has slowed right down to almost no growth at all. I do have a lot of side effects with it especially chills, hot flashes, some joint pain and weight gain. overall it's worked quite well	10	February 23, 2018	38
Abiraterone (Oral)	Prostate Cancer	How do you pay for the Zytiga? My co-pays are $2500. a month. I've tried to get help and so has my Doctor but because my wife and I both work we can't get any help.  I have decided to go off the Zytiga and let nature take its course.  I don't want to deplete our savings for a few months of additional life. Stage 4, metastasized to my bones. I had surgery 4 years ago. Age 71	9	January 21, 2018	37

AbobotulinumtoxinA	Facial Wrinkles	4 or 5 days after , forehead felt great n tight , within 14 days ( the norm ) one side of my top brow didn’t set , so I knew it hadn’t set in correctly...

AbobotulinumtoxinA	Facial Wrinkles	"I received forehead injections for the ""11"" crease and then some in my lips.

My lips continued to be bothersome and now 8 weeks later they still burn, pucker, swell, burn, get crusty and then dry out and peel several times a day.   I had trouble with slobbering while I ate or talked much and that has lessened but continues.  It has been a miserable experience.  I have had Botox in the past without any side effects and great results.  This use of Dysport has been so disappointing and miserable.

Abraxane	Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer	My husband, who is 74 years old, suffers from lung and trachea cancer. He receives three Abraxane infusions in three consecutive weeks. The reaction was brutal. You could say he had all the possible side effects and then some. Almost 2 month after treatment and after two hospital admissions, one of them in Intensive Care, he still feels extremely weak. Hard to believe that a medication supposed to help you live, can almost kill you. I also want to mention the extremely high cost of Abraxane. We end up paying a deductible of $2500 and we have Humana Medicare. Three treatments cost the staggering amount of $13500.	1	September 21, 2018	6
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	I've had herpes simplex for as long as I can remember. I get at least 1-2 outbreaks a year and it always springs up in the fall and the spring.  I always put Abreva on the area as soon as I feel some tingling going on. Anyone who gets cold sores knows the feeling I'm talking about. The little stabby pain that tells you something viral is happening. I put Abreva on the affected area every hour. A thick layer to keep the lips moist and to numb the area a little.   Most of the time, Abreva keeps me from getting a terrible outbreak that spreads. It will keep the cold sore mostly under the skin, so I don't have any weeping or crusting. It really is a miracle cream for me.	8	April 26, 2021	0
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	I have used Abreva for years and it seems to work well for me. Caution here, is that you must use it at the sign of a cold sore, to relieve the itch and not touch the area. It works very quickly (overnight), if applied to a sore that is already drained. As someone mentioned, it would be nice if the medication could be made transparent	10	April 15, 2021	0
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	I never have had a cold sore in my 57 yrs but strangely enough I got one on the right side it went away with some vasoline.  But then I got another on the left side of my mouth.  I mean REALLY!!!!!!  From never to two in weeks.    So I decided to get Abreva...... well, it’s been 5 days and nothing has changed.  I didn’t wait till it was advanced stage.  I caught the second one ASAP.  I can’t believe I wasted $19.00 on this garbage.    I’m gonna break out that vasoline once more.  I can’t believe what a lousy product that’s so costly turned out to be!  Waste of time and money!!!!	1	March 25, 2021	0
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	My cold sure isn’t really a sore. It’s usually tiny bumps, they a barely noticeable but I can feel them when I lick my lips and look very closely in the mirror. As I said they aren’t noticeable or sore like so I usually just let them run it’s course. This particular breakout started to spread. I purchased abreva and it made it worse and it spread even more and some of the bumps are very noticeable. I think I can conceal it with a colored gloss but I’m upset. I’ve never had a outbreak like this and I believe the Abreva was the cause of it.	1	March 13, 2021	0
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	If you use it early, Abreva works great. Normally, a cold sore will last for two weeks, but with Abreva, I can completely bypass the blister. But it’s like the virus is smart and sometimes tries to come out in a different place. If you stay on top of it, you can keep it from forming.	10	March 9, 2021	2
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	So in my early 20s the medication Abreva did work but now I'm  in 30s and it makes it  worse than ever, now I just use Lysine once a day to prevent eruptions and it is way much better :)	1	March 6, 2021	1
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	I’ve never had any luck with Abreva. I’ve always been jealous of those who have, but it just doesn’t do anything for me. Often, it seems to make it worse. I have always used it exactly as the directions indicate- ASAP, don’t smear it, dab it (to prevent spreading), and make sure to wash the container and your hands. Regardless, this just doesn’t work for me.   What I do find helps, if I can’t get a prescription of valtrex, is to ice the site as soon as I feel a tingle and to take L-lysine 3x/day. Lysine won’t cure cold sores but it stops the virus from replicating. Most of the time, it never breaks the surface if I’m quick on my toes and when it does, it only lasts 3-4 days as opposed to the week or longer it would take to run a course on its own.	2	February 15, 2021	1
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	I use Abreva as soon as I think I am getting a cold sore but I also take Lysine tablets at that time. Do some research about Lysine before you take it, see if it works for you. If a cold sore actually still surfaces, (not too often), then I keep using the Abreva as a barrier to keep the cells from spreading. I keep the ointment on only the cold sore and never rub it in or smear it. That will only cause more cells to become more infected. Hope this helps someone.	6	February 5, 2021	1
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	Have tried Abreva a few times. Never works. This last time I applied it right away when I started to feel the itch and tingling. As others have said I got the biggest blister ever and it spread super fast. Took over a week to even get some relief. My sister  who also gets them has tried Abreva before and said the same thing. Doesn't help at all. Also way overpriced for no results.		January 13, 2021	2
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	Used Abreva for the first time at the first sign of a coldsore.  I ended up with the biggest ugliest coldsore I ever had.  Horrible!	1	January 2, 2021	3
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	The negative reviews are wild to me. I've been using this for 20 years. I don't get them often enough to use the same tube twice, but the moment I feel even the slightest tingle, I am at a pharmacy within 10 minutes buying this. It works if you use it RIGHT away. The giant blister clump won't form. That is exactly how it is advertised. If the blisters have already formed, it will be as effective as mayonnaise, just go ahead and cancel your plans, you're done for a couple of weeks.	10	December 27, 2020	6
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	I agree with the first few I've read.  Abreva does NOT work and its WAY overpriced.  Been to see the doctor who gave me valtrex for the cold sores and said to use Abreva topically also.  Guess what? Months later I still have them.  I've experimented and neither works, either together or on its own.  No matter what I do it never develops beyond a blister, just kind of ebbs and flows in severity. I'm so frustrated I could scream.  Been fighting the dang things for almost a year now.  Ridiculous that there isn't something out there that works.	1	October 5, 2020	6
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	Abreva either makes more sores appear, or gives me another outbreak right away. Bad stuff. And expensive!	1	September 28, 2020	7
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	"If you already have blisters or lesions, go to the doctor... do not buy Abreva. Just like you, I hoped it would fix the problem in 2 1/2 days as advertised and didn't really have time for a trip to the doctor's office. I wasted $30 and prolonged my face deformity by relying on Abreva. New blisters actually popped up after I started using it! Only after I got proper anti-virals did the blister (and its Abreva friends) begin to heal. The doctor actually told me, ""I've never had much luck with patients who use Abreva."" Get anti-virals if you need to show your face in public anytime soon."	1	August 31, 2020	8
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	This sucks. Don’t waste your money, it makes it worse. Every. Single. Time.	1	August 22, 2020	5
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	I had been getting terrible cold sores on the outside wrapping to the inside of my nostrils for the last 10 years. Every six months or whenever I would get a cold and wipe my nose excessively, I would get one. They were painful and embarrassing and just overall gross. I have had three doctors who have given me all types of meds for it. None worked. My cold sore would last 11 days no matter what. None of my doctors mentioned abreva. One day I had a break out and my husband (on a whim) grabbed me some abreva. I applied it right away and my cold sore only lasted four days instead of 11. I apply it every time I have an itching or burning sensation where I used to get cold sores and I HAVE NOT GOTTEN ONE SINCE. I highly recommend this product.	10	August 21, 2020	5
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	I’ve been getting fever blisters for years, usually 1-2x a year now and I’m fairly good at getting them to die down within 2-5 days. I see a lot of negative comments about Abreva, I decided to try it because I really need this blister gone QUICK this time. I started using it in the first stage of a little bump yesterday - along side lysine rich foods ONLY during my outbreaks, extra lysine supplements and my valacyclovir - with my whole regimen my blister has already began to shrink and crust over within 24 hours - making this the quickest time I’ve made it basically disappear and I think a huge part of that is the Abreva I added to the mix.   You cannot solely rely on medication to aid in your outbreak - you must also watch your diet, your stress levels and any triggers - such as heat, wind, sweating - anything that can irritate the virus infected cells must be avoided or the medications are just a weak band aid.	10	May 29, 2020	13
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	$25 for a minimal amount and it took just as long to heal as if I had not used anything. It would be nice if the price would reflect the usefulness of this product.      	1	May 7, 2020	8
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	I've gotten fever blisters all my life, and so around 3rd grade I started to use abreva and it honestly helps tremendously with the pain but not so much with actually getting rid of the cold sore. I've found that using hand sanitizer works great with taking it away tho. it dries it up in 2 days tops if you apply it often enough. obviously don’t cover your whole mouth with it tho cuz your lips will get crusty lol. but this combination really works for me so I thought I’d share.	4	March 13, 2020	3
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	Every few years I seem to forget why I quit buying abreva.   Normally my coldsores last 3-4days, don't get very big etc. . But EVERY SINGLE TIME I give abreva a try, 1 small bump turns into 5 or 6 huge blisters so bad I can barely talk .  Literally have only had that happen when using abreva.  I don't know why I keep going back to it. It's horrible.	1	March 10, 2020	19
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	I started using the very first day I felt that tingle and within 4 days I had another blister, and then just as the first one was starting to clear up, along came a third. It’s been 7 days since I started using this product and I now have 3 blisters that don’t look like they’re going anywhere soon. I’m so disappointed.	1	March 8, 2020	14
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	I get cold sores usually once or 2x a year and used abreva and it only made it worse, it would grow and just be embarrassing,  so I've stuck with ACV	6	February 24, 2020	7
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	Hi! French Horn player here, and also cold sore sufferer. For those who don't know, playing any brass instrument with a cold sore is the worst thing ever. It bursts open, and you cannot take 2 weeks off for a simple cold sore especially when preparing for performances. So, usually my cold sores last longer because they are not given a fair chance at healing. I started feeling the first signs and we have a big performance coming up, so I finally gave in and bought generic brand abreva. I can't recommend this enough. It's the weekend (so no playing) and it's been 2 days since its appearance, and the cold sore is already in the final stages (scabbing and healing) (side note: I have also been taking vitamin D and C because its prime flu season so maybe that is helping, unsure). Now, I will say that the blister forms much faster when you apply it right away, however the sore doesn't get as big, and within a couple days is healing. I have been applying 3-4 times a day. Seriously try it.	10	February 24, 2020	4
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	Does not stop the blister from growing (Use Valtrex for that) but, put it on at first sight of blister and put on 5 times a day for several days.  It definitely helps heal the blister faster!  I was amazed at how quickly my blister healed	9	February 5, 2020	2
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	58-yr-old male w/near 50 yrs experience w/cold sores! When I was young my mom insisted on kissing me; seeing that “thing” on her lip I resisted. Ever since? Cold sores. Who knew better in 1970?. Started w/my own home remedies (using softened underside of bar of soap to gather that 'cream'; worked somewhat.) Tried other concoctions.  Then in 2000, Abreva! Used properly, works like magic elixir. After showering, washing your face, need to re-apply. Being allergic? Can't predict that. Don't use it once you learn that.  Key: apply upon FIRST notice of tingling. Then, you NEVER GET THE COLD SORE!!! Be sure to apply every few hours, just a little, for a couple days, even a couple applications AFTER tingling stops. You'll end up using about 1/5 of tube; careful with the 1st 'squirts' – it'll come gushing out. Now, generics out there aplenty. Make sure they have 10% docosanol – the active ingredient that does the work. Go with whatever generic is cheapest. No more than $8/tube today.	9	January 29, 2020	6
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	This is my first outbreak. The pain is unbearable. Started using abreva and I feel like it just made my sores worse and it also caused them to get bigger. Now I have two huge scabs that look absolutely disgusting. I wonder if leaving it alone would've been a better option.	4	January 22, 2020	14
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	I swear I am experiencing the same thing with the Abreva pump! I’ve used the tube , no problem, so I  got a tingle, got the pump...& BOOM , the worst cold sore ever, it swelled , oozing & spread, also little hive like bumps on top lip as someone else stated. I went to the Dr. yesterday & was told I had an allergic reaction was given 2 shots one predinisone the other Benadryl....sent home with a script for both to take in pill form. The swelling went down some it’s been about 24 hrs but the blisters are weeping and so am I. I’m just going to finish my meds, scrap the Abreva & continue with tee tree oil, aloe & original Neosporin..... after ready these comments I’m glad I know I’m not crazy.	1	January 14, 2020	9
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	I used Abreva when I was younger and it really helped a lot. Now I recently saw a fever blister on the corner of my lip so I went and bought Abreva right away and applied it to both sides of the corners of my lip. The next morning both corners of my lip was super swollen and there were several blisters!!! I couldn’t even close my mouth without being in such pain.  Definitely won’t be ever using Abreva again. Very expensive and I can’t even go out in public like this!	1	January 11, 2020	11
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	Abreva really works for me.  I’ve tried every other suggestion out there for the past several decades, to little avail.  It must be used IMMEDIATELY upon the first tingle, HOWEVER, and several times per day, and more often if it gets washed off in the shower, or after eating.  Rarely now do my cold sores get out of control for weeks on end.  When I catch them early, and I happen to have Abreva at hand, I’m looking at 3 or 4 days max to keep it down or essentially invisible.  I find that I still have to treat new ones that may try to pop up in close proximity, but that holds true whether you use Abreva or not.  Keeping it down and treated also avoids serious scabbing, cracking, bleeding, which can all add days or weeks in additional healing time.  Don’t give up people, it’s probably the best thing out there if caught early.  Sure, some breakouts are worse than others, but Abreva is still my best buddy.  I keep it at hand always, at work, and bring it with me whenever I travel.	10	January 3, 2020	6
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	Abreva takes some of the pain away and helps in healing but then I notice that I will get another outbreak worse than the first one a few weeks later. This never happened until I started to use Abreva, It happens every time. No more Abreva for me!!!	4	December 31, 2019	5
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	Totally useless for me, does not shorten the time of the cold sore, just adds another conspicuous embarrassing white blob to your lip...great.	1	December 24, 2019	10
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	So i have suffered from cold sores for years. I finally decided to give abreva a try. So yesterday morning I woke up and could feel the tingling started, so when I left the house that morning I had a red spot starting to form, stopped and got abreva applied it right away. Rubbing it in, followed the directions ALL day (ended up applying 4 times) a small blister (rare normally a good size blister forms in a day or 2 for me) formed.  When i woke up next morning blister was already scabbed and was about 1/4-1/8 size of normal blister I get, only small amount of tingling remains, very happy and will TOTALLY use again and recommend....	10	December 21, 2019	1
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	Okay peeps here's the thing, cold sores don't always act the same way every time. It's possible that you are used to it looking a certain way every time it appears (like a small circle) but years later it can make you look like you got punched in the mouth and then go back to a small circle like you are used to. It's not the product that makes your cold sore worse unless you have an allergic reaction to the chemical make up of the product but that would result in hives. Abreva is a great topical option to use ALONG with other treatment. There are medications you can use to cut the cold sore short. Do a little research and talk to your doctor to see about getting a script.  In my opinion Abreva isn't strong enough to deal with the cold sore on its own; but it is definitely beneficial when you use it along with medication.	8	December 8, 2019	12
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	Started using abreva last year for cold sores and it works, it is the closest thing to a cure I've come across. I can completely bypass a cold sore if used at first sign. Is also instrumental to the way I treat a cold sore	10	December 1, 2019	4
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	Abreva has worked for me every time.   If you use it at first sign, and rub it in until the product disappears every time you use it, it will stop the virus from growing and spreading.  My outbreaks are gone in 3 to 4 days.   If you dab it on and don’t rub it in, it won’t work.  If you use it after the blister has begun to form, it won’t work.   Also, even if you use it at first sign, the blister will form, but it won’t be as big.	9	November 17, 2019	12
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	Abreva was used at the very beginning before I even felt a tingle. I used it and it spread the cold sore terribly. Now I have two outbreak spots which is very rare for how I get them. Never buying this again. Con product that doesn’t do anything but make it way worse.	1	November 17, 2019	12
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	So unfortunately I have had cold sore outbreaks for years. I hate the stigma attached to them. But I've always used Abreva. From the pump or the tube. Both worked great... However.....this time I'm currently laid up in bed unable to speak because my cold sore has literally multiplied into several little bumps it's incredibly painful to do anything and my lip look so swollen I feel like I was punched in the lip. I don't know what happen to Abreva but it use to be good. This time has almost got me wanting to go to the hospital 	5	November 16, 2019	19
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	Best product ever for a cold sore.  This product has always reduced the size of and time of any cold sore I've had!	10	November 16, 2019	2
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	Wow...I have had just the opposite of some of the other comments.  I have had terrible cold sores all my life....and  Abreva is the best I have found to lessen the pain and start the healing, and keep the cold sore from growing to a big mess.  It has also shortened considerably the painful week or two of a cold sore.  It doesn't work overnight, but being consistent over a couple of days works wonders!  I will definitely use it every time!	8	November 6, 2019	6
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	Vitamin C. Make it your best friend. It binds to the water in your body not your blood so you have to take it consistently. They call them “cold sores “ because your immune system is compromised while you have a cold so it gives the virus a chance to break out. It sucks. I get mine on my nose and hurts terribly.	1	November 5, 2019	7
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	I take Abreva to shorten the duration of cold sore symptoms. I haven't found anything that works better. I will still get the cold sore, but if I treat at first sign, it's much less of a big deal than years gone by.  It also seems to work better if you take care of sleep, nutrition and stress as best you can. The virus is after all, opportunistic.	8	November 4, 2019	3
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	Ok... Guys... This cream may work only at the very beginning of this awful sickness hahaha... Was reading the reviews... Found this salt water recipe which works.  Seriously it burns your lips but it is good. You see I applied this cream many times but it only worsen my condition. My blister was getting bigger. Till I made a very strong salt water mix and washed my mouth with it couple times. My blister skin peeled off.  Ou yea. You betcha. It works. Couple more times and I'm all good... Try it!		October 31, 2019	12
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	I had a tingle on my lower lip and felt a bump forming. I decided to get Abreva because I’ve used it years before and it worked for cold sores. I always use Q-tips to apply and made sure no double dipping. BUT this time it made it 100x worse. Blister Bumps formed all over my bottom lip and spread to my upper lip and to the nose. I had to go to the doctor to get oral medication. Don’t ever use this product !!!!	1	October 27, 2019	11
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	I thought I had a cold sore but I think it was actually just a crack at the corner of my mouth from dry skin. I started applying Abreva and began to get little red bumps around my mouth, mostly where I was applying the Abreva. The rash spread and now I have blistery red bumps all around my mouth, and a split lip. I will never buy this stuff again.	1	October 24, 2019	11
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	I had 2 little bumps near the bottom of my lip.. I put abreva on it soon as I felt the tingling and saw the bumps starting. I went to bed and woke up the next morning. It now looks like I got punched in the mouth and I have about 7 bumps on my lip. This is the worst product I have ever used. Its 5 to 6 times the size it was before I went to bed.	1	October 23, 2019	10
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	Used Abreva once prior (from the tube). Had some swelling but within three days everything seemed to be healed and back to normal. Used the new pump this time and, MY GOD, things have taken a turn for the worse. Sometimes, after being in the sun for hours and from not getting enough rest, I’ll develop super tiny blisters on the inside of my upper lip. I put Abreva (from the pump) on this time and used it as I did with the Abreva from the tube. NEVER AGAIN. My entire lip is swollen 10x it’s normal size. It now looks like I have a million tiny little bubbles in my lip that I am PRAYING do not surface. The original three little blisters are now 7-8 and are oozing. It hasn’t spread to my face or upper lip but seems to have spread across my entire bottom lip. I don’t know if it’s an allergic reaction or if the condition has worsened. Either way, I will not use this product again. I stopped using it completely for the past 24 hours thinking the symptoms would subside. I was wrong.	1	October 20, 2019	6
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	Got a cold sore for the first time and decided to buy Abreva since they seemed like the best to heal fast. Worst decision ever! I used the cream for 10 days and my cold sore never got away, it actually got worst. Now it’s been 3 weeks and my lips are still a bit swollen and I have to go see my doctor since the cold sore keeps coming back. Don’t buy!	1	October 16, 2019	3
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	Felt a slight tingle on my upper lip with no visible bump/blister.  Tingle went away within a few minutes. Just to be on the safe side, I applied Abreva. Immediately started itching and a bump appeared within 10 minutes. Another bump surfaced within an hour. Applied another dose and low and behold, I had a 3rd cluster of bumps forming within 6 hours. 20 of my smackeroos spent on something resembling a botched lip job. I know better. Every time I use this stuff- regardless of what stage my cold sore is in- it makes it worse. Every single time. But I want to believe in it. Not anymore. Today, I am over the false hope of Abreva and accepting of the fact that this OTC is wasted money and a detriment to the herpes healing process. Just threw it in the trash because it is garbage!!!	1	October 13, 2019	5
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	Put it on immediately in the morning when I felt the tingles and by the end of the day it got bigger and spread and looks terrible, I will never buy abreva agian	1	October 12, 2019	3
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	I’ve used this product during 3 out breaks on my lip. I’ve applied it as instructed and it hasn’t work at all. Literally made no difference. On the 5th day which was today, I actually developed a smaller eruption just below the original one. This being even as I was using the medication the whole time.	1	October 11, 2019	1
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	This medication is horrible. I used it for a week with no results. I agree with others. I think it makes it worse.	1	October 11, 2019	2
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	I usually get one cold sore a year and I tried Abreva for the first time earlier this year and it worked, but I got another cold sore on Sunday which never happens that I get twice in a year and this time it’s HUGE it was bad and I never had a coldsore like this until after I used Abreva so I’m pretty sad because I still used it again and it’s making it scab over quicker but still like I feel like it’s going to make my next outbreak worst. 		October 9, 2019	2
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	This is my 2nd time using abreva the first time was not good but I thought it was due to not catching the first sign of my cold sore. So now I had the first sign of a cold sore and decided to really see if this product works. I used abreva and the next day my lip had more bumps and was more swollen. Just awful experience.	1	October 7, 2019	3
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	1/3 cup of warm water and a full spoon of salt. Mix well. Swish around your mouth for about 30 sec. it will burn... a lot. Do this 3-4 times a day and I kid you not it’ll go away within 3 days. Painful but worth it	1	October 5, 2019	9
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	Whenever I use the abreva my cold sore gets a lot worst... I don't know why. I always wash my hands before applying the product. Also, I don't like the new pump version. It pumps out a lot of product that ends up going to waste. Find another alternative!	2	October 1, 2019	4
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	I had an outbreak for the first time. It started off inside my mouth & when those burst it appeared on the outer corners. I couldn’t get a prescription, so I got Abreva.   I used alcohol pads first to disinfect the area. Then I applied Abreva with a q-tip, only dabbing (not spreading). I used a new swab every time I went to a different area on my face. I followed with a mild lotion (q-tips again) & coconut oil.   I repeated this morning, night, & after every meal for four days. I got small bumps on my lips that lasted a day or so. I didn’t use chapstick & only applied anything with clean swabs. The corners of my mouth flared up after meals but calmed after the regiment. The blisters were so tiny that only I saw them.  Abreva worked for me but my lips feel stiff and puffy where I applied it. The blisters never popped, & I never got scarring or huge breakout. I believe the other experiences on the site, next time I’ll use something else and not push my luck with this product.	9	September 24, 2019	5
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	"The product works. The packaging (pump bottle) doesn't work well at all. It""s difficult to get out the right amount. And the pump quits working, leaving product in the bottle."	9	September 20, 2019	5
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	Just awful; I cried. I used Abreva at first signs of a cold sore, and within hours, my upper lip erupted into massive painful blisters that resembled a marble. I thought it was a fluke, so I gave it another shot next time. Same reaction; I'll never use Abreva gain.	1	September 17, 2019	9
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	I got my first cold sore in May. Saw my doctor and he told me to keep using  Abreva  until it went away. Well, naive me used the Abreva for 3 weeks. I didn’t know exactly how the outbreaks usually went so when they spread across both my upper and lower lip, I didn’t realize it was the Abreva causing the mess; until they swelled up like balloons over night and my face became bumpy and itchy. I got a prescription for Valtrex and stopped Abreva immediately after that. However, my lips STILL are not 100% back to normal (4 months later). It’s like it mostly goes away for no more than 1-2 weeks before it comes back. The Valtrex helps, but there’s something else going on here. I’d like to know if anyone else has issues like me.	1	September 15, 2019	6
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	I’m amazed at how many people have had the same experience with Abreva recently. I am convinced that the formula has changed. I get cold sores very infrequently but I have always had success with applying it at the first tingle or itch.  I have had two this year and applied immediately but ended up with full blown blisters and a puffy lip which has never happened to me before. Good to know it’s not just me...I was thinking my body had become immune.  I think I will need to look into other options at this point.	2	September 10, 2019	11
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	I've used Abreva in the past it worked amazing. Normally I apply as soon as I feel the tingle but this time oh my goodness my face is so swollen. They must have changed the formula this stuff used to be amazing now it is garbage.	4	September 8, 2019	7
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	I got my first cold sore in high school and my lip swelled up so big that I couldn’t talk. Well I’m out of college now and have tried to continue on using abreva and I’m not kidding when I say it makes my cold sore even worse if that’s possible! My lip will swell up so big that it splits and I break out into more sores if I use abreva. It will also take 2 weeks for the scabs to come off. My lip is so damaged and scarred now. I switched to a prescription topical and a oral cold sore medication. I also take Lysine every day and use Lysine ointment as lip balm as well. I use to only get them once a year and now I get them every 3-4 months. My advice is steer clear from abreva!	1	September 8, 2019	3
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	I have had outbreaks since I was 7 years old. We all know that sinking feeling that comes with that lip tingle, or from waking up to a new sore. I've spent hours trying to find home remedies and determining triggers. Eventually, I started to rely on Abreva to help keep the lifecycle of an outbreak short. Fast forward 15+ years of Abreva use to today. I've had two outbreaks in the past year. Both times I reached for the Abreva, both times it got worse. Lots worse. Time to speak to my doctor about daily antivirals.	2	September 5, 2019	6
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	Seems like this is purely psychological placebo.  I’ve had far more negative experiences (where I go to put abreva on early for a small bump and wake up with 5 full blown sores) than positive.  Looking at these reviews I can see I’m not alone.	1	September 4, 2019	4
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	The worst product ever . I put it on my cold sore the day I saw it pop up it was tiny and now my symptoms just worsened and my blisters are HUGE not to mention every time I’d apply it it would burn and tingle like crazy. I WOULD NOT recommend	1	September 2, 2019	2
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	Tried it three separate times. Same thing happened. Produced a larger outbreak than leaving it alone. This product should be relabeled at Herpes fertilizer.	1	August 29, 2019	12
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	Abreva does work when used correctly. Also, Valtrex plus Abreva can prevent any further outbreaks. As soon as I feel my lip tingle I take a Valtrex and that usually gets it. Sometimes it doesn't and I have to use Abreva. I had an outbreak at work this morning. I panicked, but I took my Valtrex and didn't touch it until I used my abreva. What started out as bubbly bumps are now smoothed out and I'm just on 1 day application of it.	8	August 28, 2019	4
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	I usually use an orajel product and it seems to work. So a they didn't have it in stock. I seen abreva and had only heard great things. I had a tiny little bump I put on the abreva and went to bed now wake up with over a half dozen and it is awful. Thank you abreva	1	August 25, 2019	2
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	Don’t waste your money!!! I applied the product Abreva correctly only for it to make more cold sores appear.	1	August 24, 2019	1
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	I've been using this product on and off for about a year. Anytime I feel a flare up I'll pop a little bit of Abreva onto my lips underneath my lip balm and it INSTANTLY (or at least overnight) takes care of the issue!   My last flare up yesterday had resulted in a blister forming. I panicked as I thought it might be too late for the medication to work its magic most effectively but I applied anyway and within one day the blister popped and revealed nice soft lips underneath! Best of all, no further tingles or irritation.	10	August 22, 2019	3
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	I got abreva because the commercials say it can heal a cold sore and as little as two and a half days I have been using it for a week my cold sore hasn't gone away		August 17, 2019	2
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	I usually use abreva and it usually works for me but this time I used it at the first sign of my cold sore (as usual) and FIVE MORE CAME UP! So now it’s like I have 5 cold sores built up in one area on my face! Thank you abreva!	2	August 15, 2019	1
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	I haven’t had this bad of a breakout since I first got cold sores and didn’t know what to do. Oh, and I also was taking antibiotics for it but I thought the abreva would help prevent scaring...OMG was I wrong! It’s SO SO much worse and I’m so miserable!!	1	August 11, 2019	0
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	Same as everyone else. I used to use this product with great results but the last two times I've used it, my face blew up and got swollen, and the medication actually worsened the blister 10x what it normally is.   Worst medication ever. Do not use.	1	August 10, 2019	1
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	I usually use tea tree oil and ice, but this time I asked my wife if I could use her Abreva.  This was on day two when I had either won the race with the oil and ice or lost. I thought I had lost. But, the oil and Abreva shrank the blister over night and after two days it is nearly gone.  I will use Abreva from now on.	10	August 9, 2019	2
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	Similar to everyone else. In the past I've used Abreva and 3-4 days later the sore is well on its way to being healed. Now? My sore is massive. Biggest I've had in a decade. Absolutely not worth the 21 bucks. I'll go back to Herpacin and ride it out.	1	August 7, 2019	2
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	Abreva worked before great in the past.  This time made it worse.  They must if changed the formula.	3	August 5, 2019	0
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	I used abreva at the first signs of cold sore which I get infrequently. 2 days later the site was clearing up and I thought I was good, until several more fluid filled blisters erupted! That never happens to me. I usually use tea tree oil and coconut oil but thought maybe abreva would clear it up faster, I’ll be going back to my usual routine! Very disappointed!	1	August 2, 2019	3
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	I put Abreva on as soon as I noticed the cold sore coming on and it got worse. I thought maybe I just didn't put it on soon enough, so I continued to use it. Now, three days later and it's huge, five blisters (which some are bleeding), and just horrific looking. They changed and now their product is awful. Don't waste your money.	1	August 2, 2019	0
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	Doesn’t work at all. I applied it at the first sign and woke up with very a swollen lip and a cluster of super sore blisters.	1	July 31, 2019	3
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	Since I discovered Abreva, I have only had an outbreak once in the last 16 years and that was my fault for not applying it soon enough. It works great but you have to always be on alert for a tingle or red warm spot. It will never materialize if so. I even put it on as a precaution when I know I will be in long meetings or outdoors for a long period of time time. It really won't work once a breakout begins. I always carry a tube in my wallet. It gets expensive but worth every penny to avoid a week of those hideous nightmares.	10	July 27, 2019	1
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	I don't know what's wrong with all the other users rating this product poorly. Abreva ALWAYS heals my cold sores super fast. I suspect they are not applying it correctly? You have to use it several times a day. Basically, keep Abreva on your sore until it heals. If you only apply it once it's not going to work. My sores always heal within 3-4 days. I apply it as soon as I feel that tingle on my lip and it never erupts. It stays just a barely noticeable little bump.	9	July 26, 2019	6
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	Much like others on this list, I applied Abreva at the first sign of a cold sore this morning. And what was 1 tiny spot on my upper lip has ballooned into a cluster of puffiness. I wish I had seen the other reviews before I applied it. I do not recommend this product.	1	July 24, 2019	1
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	Wow! Crazy reading through all of these comments! I count myself lucky, I usually only get one blister a year in the spring as the weather heats up. This year I've been traveling a lot more for work to some warm dry climates. I've had to deal with them more than usual. I typically rely on valtrex however being on the road and running out of my prescription has caused me to turn to other methods. Fortunately abreva didn't make it worse but it certainly didn't help either. I heard great things about it in the past it's a shame that it no longer holds any value. Curious to learn how others deal with the annoying little blisters when in a pinch if valtrex isn't available or an option? Anyone have any recommendations?	1	July 18, 2019	2
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	I just had an outbreak this morning and only got to the pharmacy this afternoon to buy the abreva which surprisingly was on special for $15.99 instead of $20.99. I put it on and within hours, and in comparison to earlier in the day the 3 little blisters were noticeably more swollen and bubbly. It's my first time using this product and I am truly disappointed given the rap sheet it had before. I'm looking for alternatives now.	3	July 18, 2019	3
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	Ive been getting cold sores for 10 years now. I bought Abreva to help speed along the healing process. Its embarassing  having cold sores at work. Big mistake. I still have the cold sore and its even bigger and grosser. Without Abreva they're usually gone within a couple days. Throw it away... Do not buy this product. I quit my job because I was being treated poorly by my coworkers. Do not buy. Does not help cold sores at all.	1	July 15, 2019	1
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	For the last three years I’ve gotten a cold sore in the summer time. Usually induced by stress and hormones and sunshine. This past week I felt the tingle on my lip and went to Walgreens immediately to get Abreva. It has worked in the past- drying up the sore and allowing me to move on with life. However, this time it made my cold sore way worse. It spread onto my cheek and to the other side of my lip. The product is so runny that it naturally spreads throughout your face when you go to rub it in. My face has been burning for two days now. I’ve been applying ice and warm towels to my face. I even took out my 800 my ibuprofen I was given 6 months ago for postpartum recovery because the pain was that bad. I spent a whole day with a headache and feeling all around ill. Needless to say, this product is a scam and needs to be removed from the market. Thank you to those who shared alternative ways for relief.	1	July 15, 2019	0
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	Completely escalated my symptoms. I cannot believe this is happening! Stay away from this product!	1	July 14, 2019	2
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	Abreva doesn't work! I'm not sure what's changed (their formula?) But I used to use it and be fine. Cold sore would heal and go away quickly. But now, it doesn't! It makes it 10xs worse!! I go from one tiny bump, put it on, and within 2 hours have tons going down from my lip. Now I have 8 little bumps. Ridiculous!!!	1	July 13, 2019	2
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	I have used Abreva for many years with the tingling beginning of a blister on my lips. It has always worked exceptionally well. Recently I got a blister on my chin, while nothing on my lips. I put abreva on it and it did not respond at all like it had before. This time more popped up and it seemed abreva did nothing. My coworker had shingles at the same time and I am wondering if the blisters on my chin were slightly different than what I had had on my lips before?	9	July 6, 2019	0
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	I've been using Abreva for about a year, they definitely changed the formula this time around. I put it on once, where in the past when I used it , it would just scab up, now it turns into about 12 sores, all down my lip, under my lip towards my chin, caused a burn on my actual skin, its tearing me up!  $18 a tube and its just adding to my sores and pain! These things are already embarrassing because people want to act like they're not common or whatever but they are common and I've seen children with them. This was the only stuff that worked for me and now here we go. Thanks a lot Abreva	2	July 5, 2019	2
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	When I got my cold sore it was small I used this soon I got it. Later that damn day it was huge I had to go to the doctor to get cream.	1	July 4, 2019	1
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	I've gotten cold sores since I was younger and they're always about the same until I bought Abreva last night, HUGE MISTAKE! It got so much bigger and extra blisters spreading onto my face under my lip.  Went to doctors today and she said that my cold sore had gotten severely infected.  She prescribed me valacyclovir 1G to be taken 3x daily for 7 days! DON'T EVER USE ABREVA!!!!!!!!	1	June 21, 2019	4
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	I just joined the pool of unfortunate souls who fell victim to this harmful product. It's overpriced, the applicator isn't user friendly, and yes, it made the cold sore way worse than it's ever been before. I usually get these sores right after having the flu. Sometimes, they're barely visible. This time, I had one tiny little spot in the center of my lip. I applied the product generously to the entire area. The entire bottom lip blew up within a few hours. There needs to be class action lawsuit and a recall of this horrible product.	1	June 21, 2019	10
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	ABREVA DOES NOT WORK!!! FDA needs to ban it from the market! If I could post a picture, I would! I agree with everyone else’s statements! Use Valtrex if you’re not allergic to it!  Attack unsightly cold sore blisters as soon as they appear with  Campho-Phenique Max strength! Throw away the Abreva in your drawer right now! Do it now! It does not work! I used it at the first sign of the tingle! 3 hours later, my entire left side of my lip was swollen and a large cluster of blisters were visible! Talk about embarrassing! We need to start a petition to get Abreva off the market! It is a scam!!!! Used a q-tip to apply it! Ha! The end result- a swollen upper lip that’s semi hardened on that side with multiple blisters! I have used in the past. I will say within the last 8-10 years, I believe they have secretly changed the formulation especially if you’re applying it at the first indication of a cold sore/ fever blister!		June 19, 2019	5
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	I agree with everyone here that says it made their cold sore 10x worse. I get cold sores like once a twice a year and the last time I started to get one, I immediately applied abreva and the next day my lip was enormously swollen and spread to my bottom lip..I personally feel the best thing for cold sores Is to apply orajel for cold sores to it, ibuprofen for pain, benadryl for the itching and to use peroxide to clean it with cotton balls or just pouring it over affected area. Abreva is awful and not to mention ridiculously expensive!!	1	June 14, 2019	4
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	They must have changed the formula?!?! I'm having the same awful experience most of you are. Felt the tingle  Ran to the pharmacy as fast as I could(drove) When I got there in the morning there was only the $40 2 pack and nothing else on the shelf?!  I didn't have a choice. Got it and it's the most massacistic way I've ever spent money. Put it on. Took a nap (keeping my face positioned up,) and woke up two hrs later to my lip swollen 4x the normal size. Three massive blisters spanned my lip after using this product. It used to help me in the past and now my worst nightmare has happened. I'm too embarrassed to go to work like this and can't concentrate on anything but the throbbing pain that feels like my lip will actually burst.	1	June 13, 2019	5
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	I have used abreva multiple times and don’t feel that it’s helpful. It does make it more swollen but allows it the crust faster but drying it out.   I don’t use it anymore but strongly encourage people to ask their docs for valtrex. It’s a pill mediation specifically for herpes 1 or 2 - the virus that causes the blisters.   Works super well!!! I’ll have a tiny bump and take one pill and it’ll be gone the next day. It never gets bigger as long as I take it right away. The process is much more manageable and less embarrassing since it rarely ever gets to the scabbing stage.	2	June 9, 2019	4
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	I get cold sores maybe once a year and usually just wait for them to go away on their own. Decided to try Abreva this time around. Worst mistake of my life. Within a few days of using the cream it had spread to a painful quarter-sized patch of fluid-filled blisters all over my upper lip and the skin below my nose. I've NEVER seen anything like it; it was so hideous that people would flinch when they looked at me (as I still had to go to work and have a life while this was going on). Took almost three months to heal, and I still have a scar from it. I don't know what they put in Abreva but stay away.	1	June 6, 2019	2
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	Used abreva in the past and had no issues. This week I started feeling tingling on my face and went and bought a tube it’s been 3 days and my lip is now swollen and spreading. I’m happy to see I’m not the only one this happened to.  Definitely will never buy again and hope some of the suggestions on here will work for me and I can get rid of this embarrassing bubble on my face.	1	June 6, 2019	2
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	After using Abreva during the tingling stage, my sore spread to other parts of my upper lip which has never happened before.  It's almost as if the drug is bottling up the virus and the virus explodes cause it has no where to go.  Whatever the reason, this is the worst outbreak I've ever had. Will try a different product next go around.	1	June 5, 2019	5
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	Have had cold sores since the 60's. When Abreva first came out I bought some and it worked wonderfully. Not anymore and not at all. This is reflected in the reviews. Older ones are almost all positive and newer ones almost all negative. I believe the reason people are having sores explode, becoming the worst they have ever had is that it no longer has ANY of the active ingredient in the cream and when its applied it spreads the virus around without blocking it from entering healthy cells. I plan to call company and complain loudly and maybe the FDA as well.	1	June 4, 2019	8
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	I wish I'd read these reviews before sending my husband to the pharmacy yesterday to buy me some Abreva. I get cold sores from time to time, and this time I decided to actually buy something to speed along the healing process. BAD IDEA. I applied abreva to my very small, barely noticeable cold sore yesterday afternoon. By bedtime, literally 4 hours after the first application, my lip was swollen to twice it's normal size and what started as a tiny spot is now dime sized. It literally looks like someone punched me in the face. Anywhere I applied the abreva broke out into a huge cold sore. My lip looks terrible and it hurts and itches like crazy. I am so upset!  What was supposed to help made everything significantly worse!! I should have just left it alone! I called the doctor and they are calling me in a prescription for Valtrex so that maybe this monstrosity will go away! I have never been so embarrassed. Seriously... This is the worst cold sore I've ever had in my life!	1	June 4, 2019	3
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	I took Abreva and it made my cold sore worse !! It started with a small cold sore and I just wanted it to go away as I had an important event coming up so I rushed to go buy it. Instead it made my cold sore bigger and my lip is sooooo swollen. I try to do cold compress every couple hours but the swelling won’t go down. I watched some videos and they recommended apple cider vinegar . My cold sore is not in the drying up/ crusting stage bit my like is so swollen which makes it completely worse. I bought this item so it could help me not make everything worse. I definitely  deserve a refund !!!	1	June 2, 2019	3
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	Used this once and I ended up with the worst cold sore I ever had.  DO NOT USE	1	May 29, 2019	5
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	Abreva has not worked for me. I strongly recommend lemon balm. It’s cheaper than abreva and actually works. I put a few drops on a qtip and apply it for 10 minutes. I do this a few times a day and the cold sore is gone the next day. My cold sore last a day or two, rather than a week or more like it did before I used lemon balm.	1	May 20, 2019	5
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	I had a tiny little sore on my lip yesterday and I used abreva and today it’s the size of a quarter reaching to my chin. I will not be using this again. Abreva made my cold sore worse!!!	1	May 17, 2019	4
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	Ive tried Abreva, the CVS brand, and the RightAid brand  over the last 4 years. I've also put nothing on the cold sore.  My conclusion, is none of these over the counter medicines do anything to make the cold sore go away quicker.   At this point I've tried everything.  What has helped is the following;  as soon as you feel that first tingle in the lip, you have to immediately take Lysine pill and immediately put ice on it as often as you can.  This worked for me, and a couple times it completely stopped the sore from developing in the first place.  This last time I was lazy and waited over night to get ice and take the Lysine and it was too late.  It still will shorten the life of the cold sore but still will be around for about a week if you wait until the sore is present. Also Rubbing alcohol 6 times a day will dry out the sore quicker. it worked for me	1	April 28, 2019	0
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	I have been getting severe cold sores since I was 6 years old. I was so excited the first time I bought this product when my lips were tingling and I knew they were developing even thought it was 5 times as expensive as blistex and Carmex. I used it faithfully.  By the next morning my lip was extremely swollen, 3 sores formed and I continued to use it 5-10 times per day.  No luck, they lasted 10 days with the same severity.  I have now used this product for two years hoping it will be different the next time.  It never is.  Unfortunately,  I am not sure what tests were performed to allow the FDA approval and claim that it heals faster.  I will go back to just using  Carmex and planning for 10 days of pain and embarrassment:(	1	April 19, 2019	4
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	Exactly as others have said- I put it on at the first tingle. Used it religiously ALL day. This morning I woke up with TWO huge blisters, my entire lip swollen, and pain radiating down my jaw. I am 31 and have had cold sores since before I started kindergarten. Never in my life has a product caused them to WORSEN. Biggest mistake, and waste of money. I don't know what to use now.	1	April 17, 2019	4
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	Abreva does NOT work. I've tried it numerous times and it's always the same result- nothing. I've had cold sores my entire life and the only thing that has ever worked was prescription valacyclovir (Valtrex). Don't waste your money or get your hopes up with Abreva.	1	April 12, 2019	1
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	Never in my life experienced the WORST product ever. As soon as I started using the product next day it got worst, I have my lip super swollen and it actually spread all over the lip.  DON'T BUY IT!	1	April 8, 2019	1
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	I’ve been getting cold sores for years, I was so excited I caught the cold sore this time when it was a tingle. I ran to the store, actually 3 because the first two were sold out of it, and bought some. I was recommended it by 3 friends. This is probably the second worst break out I’ve had in my life. I’m so sad. I’m two days in  working with the police academy, I’m a college student and it’s embarrassing. I had high hopes for Abreva. Maybe it works for some people but not for me. It actually spread off my lip onto my face and it has never ever done that before.	1	April 5, 2019	2
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	Abreva works for me. Me being a minimal wage worker,  and break out every month.I CANNOT afford the twenty bucks every cold sore. This last pump I bought was all liquid and it ran out in a day!!! I cut it open and it wasn't near as big as the tube. I believe they are ripping people off.	1	March 29, 2019	4
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	I get cold sores less than once a year which gives me time to forget how useless a treatment Abreva is for me - so I buy another expensive tube every time. I hope I remember to try something different next time instead of wasting my money.	1	March 26, 2019	3
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	I came here to read other reviews after buying my first tube of Abreva. Should have read the reviews first. Within hours of feeling the first symptom of a blister coming on I bought Abreva on my way home after work. Biggest mistake of my life. I usually use Camphonique. Or something along the lines. Might have spelled it wrong but nope.  Decided to try the big name brand and waste twenty dollars thinking this has got to work and I caught it so early on all proud and what not. My damn lip is so swollen. And I thought maybe this is a normal reaction and the swelling will go down. After 2 whole days I've had enough. Went back to my camphor and the swelling went down within the hour. So mad at myself for not reading reviews before hand.	1	March 25, 2019	6
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	Don’t use Abreva! Used Abreva for one week and my blister got worse!	1	March 20, 2019	3
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	I have had a few cold sores in my life and after using Abreva I can safely say it made the cold sore the worst I’ve ever had! It is literally half the size of my lip this time around. I noticed after applying the cream it would spread to wherever the cream touched. I believe this was intentional for you to buy more cream. All of my previous cold sores were 1/8th the size of this monster. I stopped applying Abreva and it stopped spreading immediately.	1	March 16, 2019	5
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	Felt a cold sore coming on, so went to get something for it. I was a bit put off by the price of Abreva, but I was helping teach a course in a few days and really wanted to get it under control. Not only did abreva not work, but I got a second blister in another spot! By far, the worst cold sore(s) of my life!! A wasted $20 for sure!	1	March 15, 2019	6
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	I have been using abreva for some years now and when it was in the tube, it worked  great.  The new pump version is runny and has been virtually ineffective.  It has  changed and NOT IN A GOOD WAY!!!	2	March 10, 2019	1
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	This product DOES NOT WORK! I’ve gotten cold sores for years, I would say maybe about 3 a year. While using abreva my cold sore spread and became more swollen. And while using abreva they can last up to two weeks. Go to a doctor and get a prescription for acyclovir or something similar. If I start taking this prescription right when I feel the cold sore, sometimes it doesn’t even develop or lasts about 1-2 days. For me, abreva just spread the cold sores and they last forever while using the cream!!!! I would just get a prescription for acyclovir and not even touch the cold sore at all.	1	March 6, 2019	0
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	I have used Abreva for many years with lots of luck. Since I ran out I bought there newest container. Its slightly larger than it used to be and being kind of pricy that made me happy. What didn't make me happy and it doesn't work anymore. In fact it has made it worse. I had two back to back cold sores I applied multiple times per day and they are the biggest they have ever been. I'm convinced with the bigger tube they thinned out the product so much it doesn't work anymore. I even purchased a second bottle in the pump form to see if I had bought a bad batch and still nothing.	1	February 7, 2019	2
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	Love this product.... I use it when I feel I am getting a cold sore and it helps to get rid of it before it starts..... love this product	10	February 6, 2019	2
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	I typically get a cold sore once a year well I felt one starting to form and I had tried abreva before but it was already after the blister had popped so it didn't really do much. Well this time I wanted to try since I felt it so early on and the next day the cold sore was bigger and worse than I  have ever had before on my life so I continued to use it not thinking maybe it was the abreva having negative effects well now I have another cold sore forming at the corner of my mouth I have never in my life had 2 at once I will not be using it anymore hopefully they will cure up on their own. Not a good experience I see a lot of people everyday and this is embarrassing	2	January 31, 2019	4
Abreva	Herpes Simplex	I never used abreva before, so I decided to try it. I applied it as soon as a felt the outbreak. This made it the WORST breakout I ever had. I highly recommend the Orajel vials, after 2 days of using them my cold sore went down significantly.	1	January 31, 2019	2
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	I've had herpes simplex for as long as I can remember. I get at least 1-2 outbreaks a year and it always springs up in the fall and the spring.  I always put Abreva on the area as soon as I feel some tingling going on. Anyone who gets cold sores knows the feeling I'm talking about. The little stabby pain that tells you something viral is happening. I put Abreva on the affected area every hour. A thick layer to keep the lips moist and to numb the area a little.   Most of the time, Abreva keeps me from getting a terrible outbreak that spreads. It will keep the cold sore mostly under the skin, so I don't have any weeping or crusting. It really is a miracle cream for me.	8	April 26, 2021	0
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	I have used Abreva for years and it seems to work well for me. Caution here, is that you must use it at the sign of a cold sore, to relieve the itch and not touch the area. It works very quickly (overnight), if applied to a sore that is already drained. As someone mentioned, it would be nice if the medication could be made transparent	10	April 15, 2021	0
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	I never have had a cold sore in my 57 yrs but strangely enough I got one on the right side it went away with some vasoline.  But then I got another on the left side of my mouth.  I mean REALLY!!!!!!  From never to two in weeks.    So I decided to get Abreva...... well, it’s been 5 days and nothing has changed.  I didn’t wait till it was advanced stage.  I caught the second one ASAP.  I can’t believe I wasted $19.00 on this garbage.    I’m gonna break out that vasoline once more.  I can’t believe what a lousy product that’s so costly turned out to be!  Waste of time and money!!!!	1	March 25, 2021	0
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	My cold sure isn’t really a sore. It’s usually tiny bumps, they a barely noticeable but I can feel them when I lick my lips and look very closely in the mirror. As I said they aren’t noticeable or sore like so I usually just let them run it’s course. This particular breakout started to spread. I purchased abreva and it made it worse and it spread even more and some of the bumps are very noticeable. I think I can conceal it with a colored gloss but I’m upset. I’ve never had a outbreak like this and I believe the Abreva was the cause of it.	1	March 13, 2021	0
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	If you use it early, Abreva works great. Normally, a cold sore will last for two weeks, but with Abreva, I can completely bypass the blister. But it’s like the virus is smart and sometimes tries to come out in a different place. If you stay on top of it, you can keep it from forming.	10	March 9, 2021	2
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	So in my early 20s the medication Abreva did work but now I'm  in 30s and it makes it  worse than ever, now I just use Lysine once a day to prevent eruptions and it is way much better :)	1	March 6, 2021	1
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	I’ve never had any luck with Abreva. I’ve always been jealous of those who have, but it just doesn’t do anything for me. Often, it seems to make it worse. I have always used it exactly as the directions indicate- ASAP, don’t smear it, dab it (to prevent spreading), and make sure to wash the container and your hands. Regardless, this just doesn’t work for me.   What I do find helps, if I can’t get a prescription of valtrex, is to ice the site as soon as I feel a tingle and to take L-lysine 3x/day. Lysine won’t cure cold sores but it stops the virus from replicating. Most of the time, it never breaks the surface if I’m quick on my toes and when it does, it only lasts 3-4 days as opposed to the week or longer it would take to run a course on its own.	2	February 15, 2021	1
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	I use Abreva as soon as I think I am getting a cold sore but I also take Lysine tablets at that time. Do some research about Lysine before you take it, see if it works for you. If a cold sore actually still surfaces, (not too often), then I keep using the Abreva as a barrier to keep the cells from spreading. I keep the ointment on only the cold sore and never rub it in or smear it. That will only cause more cells to become more infected. Hope this helps someone.	6	February 5, 2021	1
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	Have tried Abreva a few times. Never works. This last time I applied it right away when I started to feel the itch and tingling. As others have said I got the biggest blister ever and it spread super fast. Took over a week to even get some relief. My sister  who also gets them has tried Abreva before and said the same thing. Doesn't help at all. Also way overpriced for no results.		January 13, 2021	2
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	Used Abreva for the first time at the first sign of a coldsore.  I ended up with the biggest ugliest coldsore I ever had.  Horrible!	1	January 2, 2021	3
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	The negative reviews are wild to me. I've been using this for 20 years. I don't get them often enough to use the same tube twice, but the moment I feel even the slightest tingle, I am at a pharmacy within 10 minutes buying this. It works if you use it RIGHT away. The giant blister clump won't form. That is exactly how it is advertised. If the blisters have already formed, it will be as effective as mayonnaise, just go ahead and cancel your plans, you're done for a couple of weeks.	10	December 27, 2020	6
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	I agree with the first few I've read.  Abreva does NOT work and its WAY overpriced.  Been to see the doctor who gave me valtrex for the cold sores and said to use Abreva topically also.  Guess what? Months later I still have them.  I've experimented and neither works, either together or on its own.  No matter what I do it never develops beyond a blister, just kind of ebbs and flows in severity. I'm so frustrated I could scream.  Been fighting the dang things for almost a year now.  Ridiculous that there isn't something out there that works.	1	October 5, 2020	6
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	Abreva either makes more sores appear, or gives me another outbreak right away. Bad stuff. And expensive!	1	September 28, 2020	7
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	"If you already have blisters or lesions, go to the doctor... do not buy Abreva. Just like you, I hoped it would fix the problem in 2 1/2 days as advertised and didn't really have time for a trip to the doctor's office. I wasted $30 and prolonged my face deformity by relying on Abreva. New blisters actually popped up after I started using it! Only after I got proper anti-virals did the blister (and its Abreva friends) begin to heal. The doctor actually told me, ""I've never had much luck with patients who use Abreva."" Get anti-virals if you need to show your face in public anytime soon."	1	August 31, 2020	8
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	This sucks. Don’t waste your money, it makes it worse. Every. Single. Time.	1	August 22, 2020	5
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	I had been getting terrible cold sores on the outside wrapping to the inside of my nostrils for the last 10 years. Every six months or whenever I would get a cold and wipe my nose excessively, I would get one. They were painful and embarrassing and just overall gross. I have had three doctors who have given me all types of meds for it. None worked. My cold sore would last 11 days no matter what. None of my doctors mentioned abreva. One day I had a break out and my husband (on a whim) grabbed me some abreva. I applied it right away and my cold sore only lasted four days instead of 11. I apply it every time I have an itching or burning sensation where I used to get cold sores and I HAVE NOT GOTTEN ONE SINCE. I highly recommend this product.	10	August 21, 2020	5
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	I’ve been getting fever blisters for years, usually 1-2x a year now and I’m fairly good at getting them to die down within 2-5 days. I see a lot of negative comments about Abreva, I decided to try it because I really need this blister gone QUICK this time. I started using it in the first stage of a little bump yesterday - along side lysine rich foods ONLY during my outbreaks, extra lysine supplements and my valacyclovir - with my whole regimen my blister has already began to shrink and crust over within 24 hours - making this the quickest time I’ve made it basically disappear and I think a huge part of that is the Abreva I added to the mix.   You cannot solely rely on medication to aid in your outbreak - you must also watch your diet, your stress levels and any triggers - such as heat, wind, sweating - anything that can irritate the virus infected cells must be avoided or the medications are just a weak band aid.	10	May 29, 2020	13
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	$25 for a minimal amount and it took just as long to heal as if I had not used anything. It would be nice if the price would reflect the usefulness of this product.      	1	May 7, 2020	8
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	I've gotten fever blisters all my life, and so around 3rd grade I started to use abreva and it honestly helps tremendously with the pain but not so much with actually getting rid of the cold sore. I've found that using hand sanitizer works great with taking it away tho. it dries it up in 2 days tops if you apply it often enough. obviously don’t cover your whole mouth with it tho cuz your lips will get crusty lol. but this combination really works for me so I thought I’d share.	4	March 13, 2020	3
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	Every few years I seem to forget why I quit buying abreva.   Normally my coldsores last 3-4days, don't get very big etc. . But EVERY SINGLE TIME I give abreva a try, 1 small bump turns into 5 or 6 huge blisters so bad I can barely talk .  Literally have only had that happen when using abreva.  I don't know why I keep going back to it. It's horrible.	1	March 10, 2020	19
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	I started using the very first day I felt that tingle and within 4 days I had another blister, and then just as the first one was starting to clear up, along came a third. It’s been 7 days since I started using this product and I now have 3 blisters that don’t look like they’re going anywhere soon. I’m so disappointed.	1	March 8, 2020	14
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	I get cold sores usually once or 2x a year and used abreva and it only made it worse, it would grow and just be embarrassing,  so I've stuck with ACV	6	February 24, 2020	7
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	Hi! French Horn player here, and also cold sore sufferer. For those who don't know, playing any brass instrument with a cold sore is the worst thing ever. It bursts open, and you cannot take 2 weeks off for a simple cold sore especially when preparing for performances. So, usually my cold sores last longer because they are not given a fair chance at healing. I started feeling the first signs and we have a big performance coming up, so I finally gave in and bought generic brand abreva. I can't recommend this enough. It's the weekend (so no playing) and it's been 2 days since its appearance, and the cold sore is already in the final stages (scabbing and healing) (side note: I have also been taking vitamin D and C because its prime flu season so maybe that is helping, unsure). Now, I will say that the blister forms much faster when you apply it right away, however the sore doesn't get as big, and within a couple days is healing. I have been applying 3-4 times a day. Seriously try it.	10	February 24, 2020	4
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	Does not stop the blister from growing (Use Valtrex for that) but, put it on at first sight of blister and put on 5 times a day for several days.  It definitely helps heal the blister faster!  I was amazed at how quickly my blister healed	9	February 5, 2020	2
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	58-yr-old male w/near 50 yrs experience w/cold sores! When I was young my mom insisted on kissing me; seeing that “thing” on her lip I resisted. Ever since? Cold sores. Who knew better in 1970?. Started w/my own home remedies (using softened underside of bar of soap to gather that 'cream'; worked somewhat.) Tried other concoctions.  Then in 2000, Abreva! Used properly, works like magic elixir. After showering, washing your face, need to re-apply. Being allergic? Can't predict that. Don't use it once you learn that.  Key: apply upon FIRST notice of tingling. Then, you NEVER GET THE COLD SORE!!! Be sure to apply every few hours, just a little, for a couple days, even a couple applications AFTER tingling stops. You'll end up using about 1/5 of tube; careful with the 1st 'squirts' – it'll come gushing out. Now, generics out there aplenty. Make sure they have 10% docosanol – the active ingredient that does the work. Go with whatever generic is cheapest. No more than $8/tube today.	9	January 29, 2020	6
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	This is my first outbreak. The pain is unbearable. Started using abreva and I feel like it just made my sores worse and it also caused them to get bigger. Now I have two huge scabs that look absolutely disgusting. I wonder if leaving it alone would've been a better option.	4	January 22, 2020	14
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	I swear I am experiencing the same thing with the Abreva pump! I’ve used the tube , no problem, so I  got a tingle, got the pump...& BOOM , the worst cold sore ever, it swelled , oozing & spread, also little hive like bumps on top lip as someone else stated. I went to the Dr. yesterday & was told I had an allergic reaction was given 2 shots one predinisone the other Benadryl....sent home with a script for both to take in pill form. The swelling went down some it’s been about 24 hrs but the blisters are weeping and so am I. I’m just going to finish my meds, scrap the Abreva & continue with tee tree oil, aloe & original Neosporin..... after ready these comments I’m glad I know I’m not crazy.	1	January 14, 2020	9
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	I used Abreva when I was younger and it really helped a lot. Now I recently saw a fever blister on the corner of my lip so I went and bought Abreva right away and applied it to both sides of the corners of my lip. The next morning both corners of my lip was super swollen and there were several blisters!!! I couldn’t even close my mouth without being in such pain.  Definitely won’t be ever using Abreva again. Very expensive and I can’t even go out in public like this!	1	January 11, 2020	11
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	Abreva really works for me.  I’ve tried every other suggestion out there for the past several decades, to little avail.  It must be used IMMEDIATELY upon the first tingle, HOWEVER, and several times per day, and more often if it gets washed off in the shower, or after eating.  Rarely now do my cold sores get out of control for weeks on end.  When I catch them early, and I happen to have Abreva at hand, I’m looking at 3 or 4 days max to keep it down or essentially invisible.  I find that I still have to treat new ones that may try to pop up in close proximity, but that holds true whether you use Abreva or not.  Keeping it down and treated also avoids serious scabbing, cracking, bleeding, which can all add days or weeks in additional healing time.  Don’t give up people, it’s probably the best thing out there if caught early.  Sure, some breakouts are worse than others, but Abreva is still my best buddy.  I keep it at hand always, at work, and bring it with me whenever I travel.	10	January 3, 2020	6
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	Abreva takes some of the pain away and helps in healing but then I notice that I will get another outbreak worse than the first one a few weeks later. This never happened until I started to use Abreva, It happens every time. No more Abreva for me!!!	4	December 31, 2019	5
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	Totally useless for me, does not shorten the time of the cold sore, just adds another conspicuous embarrassing white blob to your lip...great.	1	December 24, 2019	10
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	So i have suffered from cold sores for years. I finally decided to give abreva a try. So yesterday morning I woke up and could feel the tingling started, so when I left the house that morning I had a red spot starting to form, stopped and got abreva applied it right away. Rubbing it in, followed the directions ALL day (ended up applying 4 times) a small blister (rare normally a good size blister forms in a day or 2 for me) formed.  When i woke up next morning blister was already scabbed and was about 1/4-1/8 size of normal blister I get, only small amount of tingling remains, very happy and will TOTALLY use again and recommend....	10	December 21, 2019	1
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	Okay peeps here's the thing, cold sores don't always act the same way every time. It's possible that you are used to it looking a certain way every time it appears (like a small circle) but years later it can make you look like you got punched in the mouth and then go back to a small circle like you are used to. It's not the product that makes your cold sore worse unless you have an allergic reaction to the chemical make up of the product but that would result in hives. Abreva is a great topical option to use ALONG with other treatment. There are medications you can use to cut the cold sore short. Do a little research and talk to your doctor to see about getting a script.  In my opinion Abreva isn't strong enough to deal with the cold sore on its own; but it is definitely beneficial when you use it along with medication.	8	December 8, 2019	12
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	Started using abreva last year for cold sores and it works, it is the closest thing to a cure I've come across. I can completely bypass a cold sore if used at first sign. Is also instrumental to the way I treat a cold sore	10	December 1, 2019	4
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	Abreva has worked for me every time.   If you use it at first sign, and rub it in until the product disappears every time you use it, it will stop the virus from growing and spreading.  My outbreaks are gone in 3 to 4 days.   If you dab it on and don’t rub it in, it won’t work.  If you use it after the blister has begun to form, it won’t work.   Also, even if you use it at first sign, the blister will form, but it won’t be as big.	9	November 17, 2019	12
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	Abreva was used at the very beginning before I even felt a tingle. I used it and it spread the cold sore terribly. Now I have two outbreak spots which is very rare for how I get them. Never buying this again. Con product that doesn’t do anything but make it way worse.	1	November 17, 2019	12
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	So unfortunately I have had cold sore outbreaks for years. I hate the stigma attached to them. But I've always used Abreva. From the pump or the tube. Both worked great... However.....this time I'm currently laid up in bed unable to speak because my cold sore has literally multiplied into several little bumps it's incredibly painful to do anything and my lip look so swollen I feel like I was punched in the lip. I don't know what happen to Abreva but it use to be good. This time has almost got me wanting to go to the hospital 	5	November 16, 2019	19
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	Best product ever for a cold sore.  This product has always reduced the size of and time of any cold sore I've had!	10	November 16, 2019	2
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	Wow...I have had just the opposite of some of the other comments.  I have had terrible cold sores all my life....and  Abreva is the best I have found to lessen the pain and start the healing, and keep the cold sore from growing to a big mess.  It has also shortened considerably the painful week or two of a cold sore.  It doesn't work overnight, but being consistent over a couple of days works wonders!  I will definitely use it every time!	8	November 6, 2019	6
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	Vitamin C. Make it your best friend. It binds to the water in your body not your blood so you have to take it consistently. They call them “cold sores “ because your immune system is compromised while you have a cold so it gives the virus a chance to break out. It sucks. I get mine on my nose and hurts terribly.	1	November 5, 2019	7
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	I take Abreva to shorten the duration of cold sore symptoms. I haven't found anything that works better. I will still get the cold sore, but if I treat at first sign, it's much less of a big deal than years gone by.  It also seems to work better if you take care of sleep, nutrition and stress as best you can. The virus is after all, opportunistic.	8	November 4, 2019	3
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	Ok... Guys... This cream may work only at the very beginning of this awful sickness hahaha... Was reading the reviews... Found this salt water recipe which works.  Seriously it burns your lips but it is good. You see I applied this cream many times but it only worsen my condition. My blister was getting bigger. Till I made a very strong salt water mix and washed my mouth with it couple times. My blister skin peeled off.  Ou yea. You betcha. It works. Couple more times and I'm all good... Try it!		October 31, 2019	12
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	I had a tingle on my lower lip and felt a bump forming. I decided to get Abreva because I’ve used it years before and it worked for cold sores. I always use Q-tips to apply and made sure no double dipping. BUT this time it made it 100x worse. Blister Bumps formed all over my bottom lip and spread to my upper lip and to the nose. I had to go to the doctor to get oral medication. Don’t ever use this product !!!!	1	October 27, 2019	11
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	I thought I had a cold sore but I think it was actually just a crack at the corner of my mouth from dry skin. I started applying Abreva and began to get little red bumps around my mouth, mostly where I was applying the Abreva. The rash spread and now I have blistery red bumps all around my mouth, and a split lip. I will never buy this stuff again.	1	October 24, 2019	11
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	I had 2 little bumps near the bottom of my lip.. I put abreva on it soon as I felt the tingling and saw the bumps starting. I went to bed and woke up the next morning. It now looks like I got punched in the mouth and I have about 7 bumps on my lip. This is the worst product I have ever used. Its 5 to 6 times the size it was before I went to bed.	1	October 23, 2019	10
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	Used Abreva once prior (from the tube). Had some swelling but within three days everything seemed to be healed and back to normal. Used the new pump this time and, MY GOD, things have taken a turn for the worse. Sometimes, after being in the sun for hours and from not getting enough rest, I’ll develop super tiny blisters on the inside of my upper lip. I put Abreva (from the pump) on this time and used it as I did with the Abreva from the tube. NEVER AGAIN. My entire lip is swollen 10x it’s normal size. It now looks like I have a million tiny little bubbles in my lip that I am PRAYING do not surface. The original three little blisters are now 7-8 and are oozing. It hasn’t spread to my face or upper lip but seems to have spread across my entire bottom lip. I don’t know if it’s an allergic reaction or if the condition has worsened. Either way, I will not use this product again. I stopped using it completely for the past 24 hours thinking the symptoms would subside. I was wrong.	1	October 20, 2019	6
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	Got a cold sore for the first time and decided to buy Abreva since they seemed like the best to heal fast. Worst decision ever! I used the cream for 10 days and my cold sore never got away, it actually got worst. Now it’s been 3 weeks and my lips are still a bit swollen and I have to go see my doctor since the cold sore keeps coming back. Don’t buy!	1	October 16, 2019	3
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	Felt a slight tingle on my upper lip with no visible bump/blister.  Tingle went away within a few minutes. Just to be on the safe side, I applied Abreva. Immediately started itching and a bump appeared within 10 minutes. Another bump surfaced within an hour. Applied another dose and low and behold, I had a 3rd cluster of bumps forming within 6 hours. 20 of my smackeroos spent on something resembling a botched lip job. I know better. Every time I use this stuff- regardless of what stage my cold sore is in- it makes it worse. Every single time. But I want to believe in it. Not anymore. Today, I am over the false hope of Abreva and accepting of the fact that this OTC is wasted money and a detriment to the herpes healing process. Just threw it in the trash because it is garbage!!!	1	October 13, 2019	5
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	Put it on immediately in the morning when I felt the tingles and by the end of the day it got bigger and spread and looks terrible, I will never buy abreva agian	1	October 12, 2019	3
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	I’ve used this product during 3 out breaks on my lip. I’ve applied it as instructed and it hasn’t work at all. Literally made no difference. On the 5th day which was today, I actually developed a smaller eruption just below the original one. This being even as I was using the medication the whole time.	1	October 11, 2019	1
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	This medication is horrible. I used it for a week with no results. I agree with others. I think it makes it worse.	1	October 11, 2019	2
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	I usually get one cold sore a year and I tried Abreva for the first time earlier this year and it worked, but I got another cold sore on Sunday which never happens that I get twice in a year and this time it’s HUGE it was bad and I never had a coldsore like this until after I used Abreva so I’m pretty sad because I still used it again and it’s making it scab over quicker but still like I feel like it’s going to make my next outbreak worst. 		October 9, 2019	2
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	This is my 2nd time using abreva the first time was not good but I thought it was due to not catching the first sign of my cold sore. So now I had the first sign of a cold sore and decided to really see if this product works. I used abreva and the next day my lip had more bumps and was more swollen. Just awful experience.	1	October 7, 2019	3
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	1/3 cup of warm water and a full spoon of salt. Mix well. Swish around your mouth for about 30 sec. it will burn... a lot. Do this 3-4 times a day and I kid you not it’ll go away within 3 days. Painful but worth it	1	October 5, 2019	9
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	Whenever I use the abreva my cold sore gets a lot worst... I don't know why. I always wash my hands before applying the product. Also, I don't like the new pump version. It pumps out a lot of product that ends up going to waste. Find another alternative!	2	October 1, 2019	4
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	I had an outbreak for the first time. It started off inside my mouth & when those burst it appeared on the outer corners. I couldn’t get a prescription, so I got Abreva.   I used alcohol pads first to disinfect the area. Then I applied Abreva with a q-tip, only dabbing (not spreading). I used a new swab every time I went to a different area on my face. I followed with a mild lotion (q-tips again) & coconut oil.   I repeated this morning, night, & after every meal for four days. I got small bumps on my lips that lasted a day or so. I didn’t use chapstick & only applied anything with clean swabs. The corners of my mouth flared up after meals but calmed after the regiment. The blisters were so tiny that only I saw them.  Abreva worked for me but my lips feel stiff and puffy where I applied it. The blisters never popped, & I never got scarring or huge breakout. I believe the other experiences on the site, next time I’ll use something else and not push my luck with this product.	9	September 24, 2019	5
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	"The product works. The packaging (pump bottle) doesn't work well at all. It""s difficult to get out the right amount. And the pump quits working, leaving product in the bottle."	9	September 20, 2019	5
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	Just awful; I cried. I used Abreva at first signs of a cold sore, and within hours, my upper lip erupted into massive painful blisters that resembled a marble. I thought it was a fluke, so I gave it another shot next time. Same reaction; I'll never use Abreva gain.	1	September 17, 2019	9
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	I got my first cold sore in May. Saw my doctor and he told me to keep using  Abreva  until it went away. Well, naive me used the Abreva for 3 weeks. I didn’t know exactly how the outbreaks usually went so when they spread across both my upper and lower lip, I didn’t realize it was the Abreva causing the mess; until they swelled up like balloons over night and my face became bumpy and itchy. I got a prescription for Valtrex and stopped Abreva immediately after that. However, my lips STILL are not 100% back to normal (4 months later). It’s like it mostly goes away for no more than 1-2 weeks before it comes back. The Valtrex helps, but there’s something else going on here. I’d like to know if anyone else has issues like me.	1	September 15, 2019	6
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	I’m amazed at how many people have had the same experience with Abreva recently. I am convinced that the formula has changed. I get cold sores very infrequently but I have always had success with applying it at the first tingle or itch.  I have had two this year and applied immediately but ended up with full blown blisters and a puffy lip which has never happened to me before. Good to know it’s not just me...I was thinking my body had become immune.  I think I will need to look into other options at this point.	2	September 10, 2019	11
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	I've used Abreva in the past it worked amazing. Normally I apply as soon as I feel the tingle but this time oh my goodness my face is so swollen. They must have changed the formula this stuff used to be amazing now it is garbage.	4	September 8, 2019	7
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	I got my first cold sore in high school and my lip swelled up so big that I couldn’t talk. Well I’m out of college now and have tried to continue on using abreva and I’m not kidding when I say it makes my cold sore even worse if that’s possible! My lip will swell up so big that it splits and I break out into more sores if I use abreva. It will also take 2 weeks for the scabs to come off. My lip is so damaged and scarred now. I switched to a prescription topical and a oral cold sore medication. I also take Lysine every day and use Lysine ointment as lip balm as well. I use to only get them once a year and now I get them every 3-4 months. My advice is steer clear from abreva!	1	September 8, 2019	3
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	I have had outbreaks since I was 7 years old. We all know that sinking feeling that comes with that lip tingle, or from waking up to a new sore. I've spent hours trying to find home remedies and determining triggers. Eventually, I started to rely on Abreva to help keep the lifecycle of an outbreak short. Fast forward 15+ years of Abreva use to today. I've had two outbreaks in the past year. Both times I reached for the Abreva, both times it got worse. Lots worse. Time to speak to my doctor about daily antivirals.	2	September 5, 2019	6
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	Seems like this is purely psychological placebo.  I’ve had far more negative experiences (where I go to put abreva on early for a small bump and wake up with 5 full blown sores) than positive.  Looking at these reviews I can see I’m not alone.	1	September 4, 2019	4
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	The worst product ever . I put it on my cold sore the day I saw it pop up it was tiny and now my symptoms just worsened and my blisters are HUGE not to mention every time I’d apply it it would burn and tingle like crazy. I WOULD NOT recommend	1	September 2, 2019	2
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	Tried it three separate times. Same thing happened. Produced a larger outbreak than leaving it alone. This product should be relabeled at Herpes fertilizer.	1	August 29, 2019	12
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	Abreva does work when used correctly. Also, Valtrex plus Abreva can prevent any further outbreaks. As soon as I feel my lip tingle I take a Valtrex and that usually gets it. Sometimes it doesn't and I have to use Abreva. I had an outbreak at work this morning. I panicked, but I took my Valtrex and didn't touch it until I used my abreva. What started out as bubbly bumps are now smoothed out and I'm just on 1 day application of it.	8	August 28, 2019	4
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	I usually use an orajel product and it seems to work. So a they didn't have it in stock. I seen abreva and had only heard great things. I had a tiny little bump I put on the abreva and went to bed now wake up with over a half dozen and it is awful. Thank you abreva	1	August 25, 2019	2
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	Don’t waste your money!!! I applied the product Abreva correctly only for it to make more cold sores appear.	1	August 24, 2019	1
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	I've been using this product on and off for about a year. Anytime I feel a flare up I'll pop a little bit of Abreva onto my lips underneath my lip balm and it INSTANTLY (or at least overnight) takes care of the issue!   My last flare up yesterday had resulted in a blister forming. I panicked as I thought it might be too late for the medication to work its magic most effectively but I applied anyway and within one day the blister popped and revealed nice soft lips underneath! Best of all, no further tingles or irritation.	10	August 22, 2019	3
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	I got abreva because the commercials say it can heal a cold sore and as little as two and a half days I have been using it for a week my cold sore hasn't gone away		August 17, 2019	2
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	I usually use abreva and it usually works for me but this time I used it at the first sign of my cold sore (as usual) and FIVE MORE CAME UP! So now it’s like I have 5 cold sores built up in one area on my face! Thank you abreva!	2	August 15, 2019	1
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	I haven’t had this bad of a breakout since I first got cold sores and didn’t know what to do. Oh, and I also was taking antibiotics for it but I thought the abreva would help prevent scaring...OMG was I wrong! It’s SO SO much worse and I’m so miserable!!	1	August 11, 2019	0
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	Same as everyone else. I used to use this product with great results but the last two times I've used it, my face blew up and got swollen, and the medication actually worsened the blister 10x what it normally is.   Worst medication ever. Do not use.	1	August 10, 2019	1
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	I usually use tea tree oil and ice, but this time I asked my wife if I could use her Abreva.  This was on day two when I had either won the race with the oil and ice or lost. I thought I had lost. But, the oil and Abreva shrank the blister over night and after two days it is nearly gone.  I will use Abreva from now on.	10	August 9, 2019	2
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	Similar to everyone else. In the past I've used Abreva and 3-4 days later the sore is well on its way to being healed. Now? My sore is massive. Biggest I've had in a decade. Absolutely not worth the 21 bucks. I'll go back to Herpacin and ride it out.	1	August 7, 2019	2
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	Abreva worked before great in the past.  This time made it worse.  They must if changed the formula.	3	August 5, 2019	0
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	I used abreva at the first signs of cold sore which I get infrequently. 2 days later the site was clearing up and I thought I was good, until several more fluid filled blisters erupted! That never happens to me. I usually use tea tree oil and coconut oil but thought maybe abreva would clear it up faster, I’ll be going back to my usual routine! Very disappointed!	1	August 2, 2019	3
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	I put Abreva on as soon as I noticed the cold sore coming on and it got worse. I thought maybe I just didn't put it on soon enough, so I continued to use it. Now, three days later and it's huge, five blisters (which some are bleeding), and just horrific looking. They changed and now their product is awful. Don't waste your money.	1	August 2, 2019	0
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	Doesn’t work at all. I applied it at the first sign and woke up with very a swollen lip and a cluster of super sore blisters.	1	July 31, 2019	3
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	Since I discovered Abreva, I have only had an outbreak once in the last 16 years and that was my fault for not applying it soon enough. It works great but you have to always be on alert for a tingle or red warm spot. It will never materialize if so. I even put it on as a precaution when I know I will be in long meetings or outdoors for a long period of time time. It really won't work once a breakout begins. I always carry a tube in my wallet. It gets expensive but worth every penny to avoid a week of those hideous nightmares.	10	July 27, 2019	1
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	I don't know what's wrong with all the other users rating this product poorly. Abreva ALWAYS heals my cold sores super fast. I suspect they are not applying it correctly? You have to use it several times a day. Basically, keep Abreva on your sore until it heals. If you only apply it once it's not going to work. My sores always heal within 3-4 days. I apply it as soon as I feel that tingle on my lip and it never erupts. It stays just a barely noticeable little bump.	9	July 26, 2019	6
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	Much like others on this list, I applied Abreva at the first sign of a cold sore this morning. And what was 1 tiny spot on my upper lip has ballooned into a cluster of puffiness. I wish I had seen the other reviews before I applied it. I do not recommend this product.	1	July 24, 2019	1
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	Wow! Crazy reading through all of these comments! I count myself lucky, I usually only get one blister a year in the spring as the weather heats up. This year I've been traveling a lot more for work to some warm dry climates. I've had to deal with them more than usual. I typically rely on valtrex however being on the road and running out of my prescription has caused me to turn to other methods. Fortunately abreva didn't make it worse but it certainly didn't help either. I heard great things about it in the past it's a shame that it no longer holds any value. Curious to learn how others deal with the annoying little blisters when in a pinch if valtrex isn't available or an option? Anyone have any recommendations?	1	July 18, 2019	2
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	I just had an outbreak this morning and only got to the pharmacy this afternoon to buy the abreva which surprisingly was on special for $15.99 instead of $20.99. I put it on and within hours, and in comparison to earlier in the day the 3 little blisters were noticeably more swollen and bubbly. It's my first time using this product and I am truly disappointed given the rap sheet it had before. I'm looking for alternatives now.	3	July 18, 2019	3
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	Ive been getting cold sores for 10 years now. I bought Abreva to help speed along the healing process. Its embarassing  having cold sores at work. Big mistake. I still have the cold sore and its even bigger and grosser. Without Abreva they're usually gone within a couple days. Throw it away... Do not buy this product. I quit my job because I was being treated poorly by my coworkers. Do not buy. Does not help cold sores at all.	1	July 15, 2019	1
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	For the last three years I’ve gotten a cold sore in the summer time. Usually induced by stress and hormones and sunshine. This past week I felt the tingle on my lip and went to Walgreens immediately to get Abreva. It has worked in the past- drying up the sore and allowing me to move on with life. However, this time it made my cold sore way worse. It spread onto my cheek and to the other side of my lip. The product is so runny that it naturally spreads throughout your face when you go to rub it in. My face has been burning for two days now. I’ve been applying ice and warm towels to my face. I even took out my 800 my ibuprofen I was given 6 months ago for postpartum recovery because the pain was that bad. I spent a whole day with a headache and feeling all around ill. Needless to say, this product is a scam and needs to be removed from the market. Thank you to those who shared alternative ways for relief.	1	July 15, 2019	0
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	Completely escalated my symptoms. I cannot believe this is happening! Stay away from this product!	1	July 14, 2019	2
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	Abreva doesn't work! I'm not sure what's changed (their formula?) But I used to use it and be fine. Cold sore would heal and go away quickly. But now, it doesn't! It makes it 10xs worse!! I go from one tiny bump, put it on, and within 2 hours have tons going down from my lip. Now I have 8 little bumps. Ridiculous!!!	1	July 13, 2019	2
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	I have used Abreva for many years with the tingling beginning of a blister on my lips. It has always worked exceptionally well. Recently I got a blister on my chin, while nothing on my lips. I put abreva on it and it did not respond at all like it had before. This time more popped up and it seemed abreva did nothing. My coworker had shingles at the same time and I am wondering if the blisters on my chin were slightly different than what I had had on my lips before?	9	July 6, 2019	0
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	I've been using Abreva for about a year, they definitely changed the formula this time around. I put it on once, where in the past when I used it , it would just scab up, now it turns into about 12 sores, all down my lip, under my lip towards my chin, caused a burn on my actual skin, its tearing me up!  $18 a tube and its just adding to my sores and pain! These things are already embarrassing because people want to act like they're not common or whatever but they are common and I've seen children with them. This was the only stuff that worked for me and now here we go. Thanks a lot Abreva	2	July 5, 2019	2
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	When I got my cold sore it was small I used this soon I got it. Later that damn day it was huge I had to go to the doctor to get cream.	1	July 4, 2019	1
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	I've gotten cold sores since I was younger and they're always about the same until I bought Abreva last night, HUGE MISTAKE! It got so much bigger and extra blisters spreading onto my face under my lip.  Went to doctors today and she said that my cold sore had gotten severely infected.  She prescribed me valacyclovir 1G to be taken 3x daily for 7 days! DON'T EVER USE ABREVA!!!!!!!!	1	June 21, 2019	4
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	I just joined the pool of unfortunate souls who fell victim to this harmful product. It's overpriced, the applicator isn't user friendly, and yes, it made the cold sore way worse than it's ever been before. I usually get these sores right after having the flu. Sometimes, they're barely visible. This time, I had one tiny little spot in the center of my lip. I applied the product generously to the entire area. The entire bottom lip blew up within a few hours. There needs to be class action lawsuit and a recall of this horrible product.	1	June 21, 2019	10
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	ABREVA DOES NOT WORK!!! FDA needs to ban it from the market! If I could post a picture, I would! I agree with everyone else’s statements! Use Valtrex if you’re not allergic to it!  Attack unsightly cold sore blisters as soon as they appear with  Campho-Phenique Max strength! Throw away the Abreva in your drawer right now! Do it now! It does not work! I used it at the first sign of the tingle! 3 hours later, my entire left side of my lip was swollen and a large cluster of blisters were visible! Talk about embarrassing! We need to start a petition to get Abreva off the market! It is a scam!!!! Used a q-tip to apply it! Ha! The end result- a swollen upper lip that’s semi hardened on that side with multiple blisters! I have used in the past. I will say within the last 8-10 years, I believe they have secretly changed the formulation especially if you’re applying it at the first indication of a cold sore/ fever blister!		June 19, 2019	5
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	I agree with everyone here that says it made their cold sore 10x worse. I get cold sores like once a twice a year and the last time I started to get one, I immediately applied abreva and the next day my lip was enormously swollen and spread to my bottom lip..I personally feel the best thing for cold sores Is to apply orajel for cold sores to it, ibuprofen for pain, benadryl for the itching and to use peroxide to clean it with cotton balls or just pouring it over affected area. Abreva is awful and not to mention ridiculously expensive!!	1	June 14, 2019	4
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	They must have changed the formula?!?! I'm having the same awful experience most of you are. Felt the tingle  Ran to the pharmacy as fast as I could(drove) When I got there in the morning there was only the $40 2 pack and nothing else on the shelf?!  I didn't have a choice. Got it and it's the most massacistic way I've ever spent money. Put it on. Took a nap (keeping my face positioned up,) and woke up two hrs later to my lip swollen 4x the normal size. Three massive blisters spanned my lip after using this product. It used to help me in the past and now my worst nightmare has happened. I'm too embarrassed to go to work like this and can't concentrate on anything but the throbbing pain that feels like my lip will actually burst.	1	June 13, 2019	5
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	I have used abreva multiple times and don’t feel that it’s helpful. It does make it more swollen but allows it the crust faster but drying it out.   I don’t use it anymore but strongly encourage people to ask their docs for valtrex. It’s a pill mediation specifically for herpes 1 or 2 - the virus that causes the blisters.   Works super well!!! I’ll have a tiny bump and take one pill and it’ll be gone the next day. It never gets bigger as long as I take it right away. The process is much more manageable and less embarrassing since it rarely ever gets to the scabbing stage.	2	June 9, 2019	4
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	I get cold sores maybe once a year and usually just wait for them to go away on their own. Decided to try Abreva this time around. Worst mistake of my life. Within a few days of using the cream it had spread to a painful quarter-sized patch of fluid-filled blisters all over my upper lip and the skin below my nose. I've NEVER seen anything like it; it was so hideous that people would flinch when they looked at me (as I still had to go to work and have a life while this was going on). Took almost three months to heal, and I still have a scar from it. I don't know what they put in Abreva but stay away.	1	June 6, 2019	2
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	Used abreva in the past and had no issues. This week I started feeling tingling on my face and went and bought a tube it’s been 3 days and my lip is now swollen and spreading. I’m happy to see I’m not the only one this happened to.  Definitely will never buy again and hope some of the suggestions on here will work for me and I can get rid of this embarrassing bubble on my face.	1	June 6, 2019	2
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	After using Abreva during the tingling stage, my sore spread to other parts of my upper lip which has never happened before.  It's almost as if the drug is bottling up the virus and the virus explodes cause it has no where to go.  Whatever the reason, this is the worst outbreak I've ever had. Will try a different product next go around.	1	June 5, 2019	5
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	Have had cold sores since the 60's. When Abreva first came out I bought some and it worked wonderfully. Not anymore and not at all. This is reflected in the reviews. Older ones are almost all positive and newer ones almost all negative. I believe the reason people are having sores explode, becoming the worst they have ever had is that it no longer has ANY of the active ingredient in the cream and when its applied it spreads the virus around without blocking it from entering healthy cells. I plan to call company and complain loudly and maybe the FDA as well.	1	June 4, 2019	8
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	I wish I'd read these reviews before sending my husband to the pharmacy yesterday to buy me some Abreva. I get cold sores from time to time, and this time I decided to actually buy something to speed along the healing process. BAD IDEA. I applied abreva to my very small, barely noticeable cold sore yesterday afternoon. By bedtime, literally 4 hours after the first application, my lip was swollen to twice it's normal size and what started as a tiny spot is now dime sized. It literally looks like someone punched me in the face. Anywhere I applied the abreva broke out into a huge cold sore. My lip looks terrible and it hurts and itches like crazy. I am so upset!  What was supposed to help made everything significantly worse!! I should have just left it alone! I called the doctor and they are calling me in a prescription for Valtrex so that maybe this monstrosity will go away! I have never been so embarrassed. Seriously... This is the worst cold sore I've ever had in my life!	1	June 4, 2019	3
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	I took Abreva and it made my cold sore worse !! It started with a small cold sore and I just wanted it to go away as I had an important event coming up so I rushed to go buy it. Instead it made my cold sore bigger and my lip is sooooo swollen. I try to do cold compress every couple hours but the swelling won’t go down. I watched some videos and they recommended apple cider vinegar . My cold sore is not in the drying up/ crusting stage bit my like is so swollen which makes it completely worse. I bought this item so it could help me not make everything worse. I definitely  deserve a refund !!!	1	June 2, 2019	3
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	Used this once and I ended up with the worst cold sore I ever had.  DO NOT USE	1	May 29, 2019	5
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	Abreva has not worked for me. I strongly recommend lemon balm. It’s cheaper than abreva and actually works. I put a few drops on a qtip and apply it for 10 minutes. I do this a few times a day and the cold sore is gone the next day. My cold sore last a day or two, rather than a week or more like it did before I used lemon balm.	1	May 20, 2019	5
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	I had a tiny little sore on my lip yesterday and I used abreva and today it’s the size of a quarter reaching to my chin. I will not be using this again. Abreva made my cold sore worse!!!	1	May 17, 2019	4
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	Ive tried Abreva, the CVS brand, and the RightAid brand  over the last 4 years. I've also put nothing on the cold sore.  My conclusion, is none of these over the counter medicines do anything to make the cold sore go away quicker.   At this point I've tried everything.  What has helped is the following;  as soon as you feel that first tingle in the lip, you have to immediately take Lysine pill and immediately put ice on it as often as you can.  This worked for me, and a couple times it completely stopped the sore from developing in the first place.  This last time I was lazy and waited over night to get ice and take the Lysine and it was too late.  It still will shorten the life of the cold sore but still will be around for about a week if you wait until the sore is present. Also Rubbing alcohol 6 times a day will dry out the sore quicker. it worked for me	1	April 28, 2019	0
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	I have been getting severe cold sores since I was 6 years old. I was so excited the first time I bought this product when my lips were tingling and I knew they were developing even thought it was 5 times as expensive as blistex and Carmex. I used it faithfully.  By the next morning my lip was extremely swollen, 3 sores formed and I continued to use it 5-10 times per day.  No luck, they lasted 10 days with the same severity.  I have now used this product for two years hoping it will be different the next time.  It never is.  Unfortunately,  I am not sure what tests were performed to allow the FDA approval and claim that it heals faster.  I will go back to just using  Carmex and planning for 10 days of pain and embarrassment:(	1	April 19, 2019	4
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	Exactly as others have said- I put it on at the first tingle. Used it religiously ALL day. This morning I woke up with TWO huge blisters, my entire lip swollen, and pain radiating down my jaw. I am 31 and have had cold sores since before I started kindergarten. Never in my life has a product caused them to WORSEN. Biggest mistake, and waste of money. I don't know what to use now.	1	April 17, 2019	4
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	Abreva does NOT work. I've tried it numerous times and it's always the same result- nothing. I've had cold sores my entire life and the only thing that has ever worked was prescription valacyclovir (Valtrex). Don't waste your money or get your hopes up with Abreva.	1	April 12, 2019	1
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	Never in my life experienced the WORST product ever. As soon as I started using the product next day it got worst, I have my lip super swollen and it actually spread all over the lip.  DON'T BUY IT!	1	April 8, 2019	1
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	I’ve been getting cold sores for years, I was so excited I caught the cold sore this time when it was a tingle. I ran to the store, actually 3 because the first two were sold out of it, and bought some. I was recommended it by 3 friends. This is probably the second worst break out I’ve had in my life. I’m so sad. I’m two days in  working with the police academy, I’m a college student and it’s embarrassing. I had high hopes for Abreva. Maybe it works for some people but not for me. It actually spread off my lip onto my face and it has never ever done that before.	1	April 5, 2019	2
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	Abreva works for me. Me being a minimal wage worker,  and break out every month.I CANNOT afford the twenty bucks every cold sore. This last pump I bought was all liquid and it ran out in a day!!! I cut it open and it wasn't near as big as the tube. I believe they are ripping people off.	1	March 29, 2019	4
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	I get cold sores less than once a year which gives me time to forget how useless a treatment Abreva is for me - so I buy another expensive tube every time. I hope I remember to try something different next time instead of wasting my money.	1	March 26, 2019	3
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	I came here to read other reviews after buying my first tube of Abreva. Should have read the reviews first. Within hours of feeling the first symptom of a blister coming on I bought Abreva on my way home after work. Biggest mistake of my life. I usually use Camphonique. Or something along the lines. Might have spelled it wrong but nope.  Decided to try the big name brand and waste twenty dollars thinking this has got to work and I caught it so early on all proud and what not. My damn lip is so swollen. And I thought maybe this is a normal reaction and the swelling will go down. After 2 whole days I've had enough. Went back to my camphor and the swelling went down within the hour. So mad at myself for not reading reviews before hand.	1	March 25, 2019	6
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	Don’t use Abreva! Used Abreva for one week and my blister got worse!	1	March 20, 2019	3
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	I have had a few cold sores in my life and after using Abreva I can safely say it made the cold sore the worst I’ve ever had! It is literally half the size of my lip this time around. I noticed after applying the cream it would spread to wherever the cream touched. I believe this was intentional for you to buy more cream. All of my previous cold sores were 1/8th the size of this monster. I stopped applying Abreva and it stopped spreading immediately.	1	March 16, 2019	5
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	Felt a cold sore coming on, so went to get something for it. I was a bit put off by the price of Abreva, but I was helping teach a course in a few days and really wanted to get it under control. Not only did abreva not work, but I got a second blister in another spot! By far, the worst cold sore(s) of my life!! A wasted $20 for sure!	1	March 15, 2019	6
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	I have been using abreva for some years now and when it was in the tube, it worked  great.  The new pump version is runny and has been virtually ineffective.  It has  changed and NOT IN A GOOD WAY!!!	2	March 10, 2019	1
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	This product DOES NOT WORK! I’ve gotten cold sores for years, I would say maybe about 3 a year. While using abreva my cold sore spread and became more swollen. And while using abreva they can last up to two weeks. Go to a doctor and get a prescription for acyclovir or something similar. If I start taking this prescription right when I feel the cold sore, sometimes it doesn’t even develop or lasts about 1-2 days. For me, abreva just spread the cold sores and they last forever while using the cream!!!! I would just get a prescription for acyclovir and not even touch the cold sore at all.	1	March 6, 2019	0
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	I have used Abreva for many years with lots of luck. Since I ran out I bought there newest container. Its slightly larger than it used to be and being kind of pricy that made me happy. What didn't make me happy and it doesn't work anymore. In fact it has made it worse. I had two back to back cold sores I applied multiple times per day and they are the biggest they have ever been. I'm convinced with the bigger tube they thinned out the product so much it doesn't work anymore. I even purchased a second bottle in the pump form to see if I had bought a bad batch and still nothing.	1	February 7, 2019	2
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	Love this product.... I use it when I feel I am getting a cold sore and it helps to get rid of it before it starts..... love this product	10	February 6, 2019	2
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	I typically get a cold sore once a year well I felt one starting to form and I had tried abreva before but it was already after the blister had popped so it didn't really do much. Well this time I wanted to try since I felt it so early on and the next day the cold sore was bigger and worse than I  have ever had before on my life so I continued to use it not thinking maybe it was the abreva having negative effects well now I have another cold sore forming at the corner of my mouth I have never in my life had 2 at once I will not be using it anymore hopefully they will cure up on their own. Not a good experience I see a lot of people everyday and this is embarrassing	2	January 31, 2019	4
Abreva (Topical)	Herpes Simplex	I never used abreva before, so I decided to try it. I applied it as soon as a felt the outbreak. This made it the WORST breakout I ever had. I highly recommend the Orajel vials, after 2 days of using them my cold sore went down significantly.	1	January 31, 2019	2
Absorica	Acne	Female, struggled with cystic hormonal acne on chest, back, neck, jawline and face for 9 years. Side Effects on Accutane;  Dry lips & small blisters on lips (occasional) Extremely dry red eyes (No contacts after 1st month) Abnormal hot flashes Face flushing Night vision decreased Nose bleeds Occasional blurred vision Fatigue Joint aches Headaches Fragile dry skin Dry hair Dry nose&throat Stomach pain and cramping (month 6) Hemmoriods Itchy skin & skin rash on hands  Side Effects I have now are; Dry eyes (I can wear contacts now but took 2 months after stopping meds and my eyes are still much drier than before. I have to use eye drops at night and in the morning) Dry lips (not bad) Occasional joint pain in hands  Hair loss/rapid hair shedding Itchy skin  All other side effects went away after ending meds. Worth it! 4 months after Accutane and I have no acne! Not a single cyst! I have normal skin and occasional tiny zits here and there only.	9	July 13, 2018	2
Absorica	Acne	My son was on this drug for about 4 months and the worst things happened.  He went from mild acne to the worst acne one can imagine.  It was horrible huge cystic acne.  We went to the doctor month after months with disgust in how bad his face got.  Eventually I pulled the plug and brought him to another doctor who agreed after showing him pictures that this drug was detrimentally ruining his skin.  He switched him to clarvis and within a couple of weeks it was clearing up.  My son's self esteem was detrimentally affected along with his skin. He will now need to have some type of resurfacing done to get his skin back.  We have pictures to prove what this did to his skin!!	1	February 23, 2017	8
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been taking 50mg of Mydayis for a few months now and I have been happy with my experience on this medicine. I have been on several regimens, including Vyvanse 70 + Dexedrine 10 booster, Adderall XR + Dexedrine 10 booster, Adderall xr + adderall 10 booster, Focalin XR, etc but I decided to give Mydayis a go since my new insurance has it covered on its formulary ($50 a month copay). Like others have said this drug runs in the background but I find it much more consistent and wayyyy longer acting than Adderall XR and even longer than Vyvanse, which only lasted 6 hours max for me. I take it at 5:30am and feel the medicine until about 5pm (~10 hours give or take). Mydayis less anxiety-provoking but I still feel like my ADHD symptoms are controlled around the clock and yet at the same time I feel more like myself than I did strung out on the other medicines. If you’re looking for an option that lasts a long while and your insurance will help pay for it I, think it’s a good option.	10	May 1, 2021	0
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have received my second refill of generic Adderall XR 20 mg made by Mallinckrodt and I am extremely unhappy with it. It is not at all effective. I have been on the non-generic Adderall XR for years without issue.	1	April 29, 2021	1
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have taken Adderall XR and short acting for 25 years and I got this new XR 30MG the other day Lannett and it made me tired, heart racing, BP accelerated and did NOTHING to help me focus. I contacted the pharmacy and my Dr and he's trying to switch me to another brand because this is a joke. awful..	1	April 26, 2021	6
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Just started taking adderall XR 10mg after learning I had been mis-diagnosed for 15+ years as either bi-polar, major depressive disorder and social anxiety. I finally found a psychiatrist that really dug deep and concluded I was not bi polar but I suffered from adult ADHD (33 year old male). It makes total sense as I read more about ADHD. I had been on every possible anti-depressant, anti psychotic MDD etc and was just done with meds. I was diagnosed as a child and teen but thought “ I’d grow out of it” and apparently never did it just got worse. I feel that so many people are mis-diagnosed it’s almost unbelievable. My theory and the doctor also said that if you take the medication and it calms you and your racing thoughts that that’s a tell tail sign that you do indeed suffer from ADHD, it’s not just a childhood/school era problem, it disrupts your life, marriage everything. I’m on day 2 and it’s like a light switch has been turned on and I can relax and not be manic.	9	April 25, 2021	4
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been on and off generic Adderall for many years. Currently, I have been prescribed 30 mg twice a day. For the last couple of months, it's been a nightmare. It's been on backorder and then changed the generic name from amphetamine salts combo to amphetamine/ dextroamphetamine combo. This is only because I have had severe headaches, extreme fatigue, and a loss of motivation. My ADHD has been out of the roof. It's frustrating because I feel like I did before taking any generic Adderall. I have even been concerned that maybe I was receiving a placebo rather than the actual medication. That's probably far-fetched, but it's been such a decline for me. There is something missing from this generic form and it is the essential thing that is needed to control my ADHD. I have even gained a lot of weight over the past two months. Hopefully, something will give, I can't imagine it affecting people like this and nothing changing.	3	April 19, 2021	8
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	This pill does not work like any Adderall that I have experienced. There is neither the focus or the energy bump that is typically associated with the two most therapeutic aspects of the formulation. The vast majority of time I feel equally as sleepy and unfocused as I did when I took it.    I am an experienced user of this positive life-changing medication. The patients that us this medication are in a bad position when company’s that make inferior generic medications are allowed distribution rights through equally as corrupt retail pharmaceutical outlets seeking to make a few pennies extra per script, on the back of patients whose experienced opinion is rarely considered.	2	April 17, 2021	2
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have taken ADHD meds many years. Adderall XR is the ADHD med that works the best for me. I am taking a generic manufactured by Lannett. It by far has worked the best for me with the reason(s) being is the smoothness, the come up is very quick, and it does it's job perfectly.   To reiterate, Lannett is very smooth with a quick come up, and last long enough most days.	9	April 15, 2021	4
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	If anyone else is having a terrible time with the new Lannett generic adderall you can report this to the FDA.  I have been having crippling headaches, stomach aches, and the medication doesn’t even feel like it works!!! I get tired after I take it and then can’t sleep all night because of it. HORRIBLE. Google fda medwatch online reporting to fill in the form	1	April 9, 2021	37
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Right now I take 50mg Lamictal for my Bipolar and 7.5mg twice a day Adderall for ADHD. At first I wasn't sure Adderall was going to work for me, I was initially prescribed 20mg twice a day.  That dose ended up being way too high for me, It made be become manic and I felt really wired all the time.  I now take 7.5mg twice a day and have found it to be much better. I feel alert and focused throughout the day.  Some of the side effects I have had are weight loss, jaw clenching, and mild insomnia (I usually just take melatonin). Overall, Adderall has helped me a lot, I just had to find the right dosage.	8	April 8, 2021	0
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been on Adderall for several years and the Sandoz brand is TOXIC and HORRIBLE! At first it is like a sugar pill no effect and then dizziness, headache, feeling more confused, spaced out and mind blank, extreme fatigue. I can't believe this is on the market. FDA honestly needs to step up their game and monitor the generics. It is a up and down roller coaster with different manufactures each month. This is insane. They are robbing us blind in the pharmaceutical business. They give us something toxic or a placebo. What is happening to the medications now. Please do not take the Sandoz. Read the court documents about reviews on them and they came from the company. Making themselves sound great as a pretend customer!! I can not believe how bad this medication from this manufacture is.	1	April 6, 2021	10
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Worked really well for the first week or so, but then really made me more irritable and gave me uncontrollable suicidal urges that ultimately sent me to the hospital. The suicidal urges stopped after dropping the medication.  I wouldn't recommend against the medication, I would just proceed with caution as the side effects can vary in intensity from person to person.	1	April 3, 2021	3
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been prescribed Amphetamine Salt Combo which has worked well(I have ADD and narcolepsy). Today I was given from RX, Amphetamine Aspertate, it make me fell kinda sickness. Was I given the wrong medicine. The prescription has not changed ?	7	April 1, 2021	3
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’ve been on Adderrall immediate release for at least 8 years, probably more. At first Adderrall gave me an intense high and made me very talkative. Very talkative. That lasted for a few days and after that each morning when I took it it gave me a euphoric feeling for about have the day. I wasn’t making impulsive decisions like I had in the past and my focus was razor sharp. I really enjoyed this drug for sometime but the last 3-5 years it’s just been the same old same old. I take it in the morning and have somewhat of a boost in energy and focus but after around 11am the effects of the medication just wears off. I wind up feeling irritable, decent level of focus if I’m busy at work, and just downright not very social with people. This week I’m going to see my P.A. and hopefully get on Vyvanse which I was encouraged by many to try before jumping on Adderrall. Vyvanse is more expensive but I’m ready to feel more focused and more myself.	5	March 28, 2021	4
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	This review is for generic Adderall XR - amphetamine/dextroamphetamine. I've experienced wildly different effects from different manufacturers. Some days it didn't work. Some days it worked great. But I got severe debilitating headaches that lasted 24/7 and didn't go away using ibuprofen. Went to neurologist and got an MRI. If I could push past the side effects it did work well but for only about 4-5 hours after kicking in (which took about an hour). Needed a booster of IR in the afternoon, so eventually I couldn't deal with the headaches and switched to IR completely. Headaches gone almost immediately. I still get them with IR but not anywhere near as often or as bad.	6	March 23, 2021	1
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	"I've tried several ADHD meds and Mydayis has definitely been the best for me. I'm on the lowest dose and it starts working 20-30 minutes after I take it. I'm then able to be productive and direct my focus easily, compared to other meds (eg-Adderall) which gave me a burst of intense focus that I had no control over. The transitions are barely noticeable and it really helps maintain consistent energy levels. After wearing off, it's a very natural ""I've worked all day and now I'm ready to relax before bed"" feeling (no crash). I also noticed it significantly helps manage my depression-something no other ADHD med has done. The only downsides: (1) it does reduce my appetite a lot and (2) it only lasts about 9-10 hours on my current dose (12.5mg), but higher doses (25mg+) give me headaches. It's not perfect, but the positives definitely outweigh the negatives for me. Lastly-you don't know how it'll affect you, so don't let reviews scare you away if you/your doc think it might help."	9	March 21, 2021	4
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I was diagnosed with ADHD at age 17 and only really started taking stimulant medication after I had turned 20 last year. I was originally trying out varying doses of IR but started trying XR in the past few months.  Overall: Hit or miss for me. It does help with my focus, but the side effects and how much it helps varies pretty drastically depending on the day. Biggest side effects are dehydration, lack of appetite, potentially crashing at night (normal). I also feel a bit uncomfortable sometimes (anxiety-ish twitchy feeling) but that's not very common.  The mallinckrodt brand I was switched to recently seems maybe a bit more hit or miss honestly I can't really tell that much of a difference (unlike people on opioids who swear that mallinckrodt is awful). I'm on 25mg for now and I'm gonna keep seeing how I feel in the coming weeks. Helps with ADHD no doubt, but do be weary of the side effects.	7	March 16, 2021	2
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I took Mydayis 37.5 mg for 2 years. I just recently ran out and decided to wait a week to refill. I cannot believe the change in myself! While on it I became withdrawn and too focused on 1 specific thing. I cut out people and ruined my small business. I didn't feel human! I can't explain the feeling but now that I haven't taken it in a week I feel like myself again! I was just flesh living day by day on mydayis! I will NEVER touch it again!

I had already suffered from side effects from other generics due to CVS giving me a different generic a few times without consent or being informed. I did the whole google wormhole for a few months before finally seeing a random comment about ""INACTIVE"" ingredients and how this person suffered terrible side effects across multiple generic medications with this same ""INACTIVE"" ingredient. Being on multiple meds myself and having autoimmune and neuro disorders it affected my mental health knowing something wasn't right and just not grasping why & not understanding. That random comment changed everything for me ""INACTIVE"" does not equal no effect.  Teva not being an option then and now not at all I use Mallinckrodt and Arubindo 20 mg. I find it helps to switch them every couple months or I take M in the morning and A in the afternoon depending on how my body is functioning. I tried SAndoz that was terrible side effects."	8	March 6, 2021	2
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	My 7 year old son is a first grader and was recently diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. He has been recommended Adderall for this but I am a bit reluctant to initiate its usage. I have a few reservations about how long it lasts in our system which I have heard can prove to be dangerous for a young kid. I have read multiple articles like these, but I am still not so sure. Seeing the number of experienced people here, please tell me if I should continue with it.		March 4, 2021	4
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	First time taking Alvogen generic amphetamine with dextroamphetamine 30mg. Been taking adderall for 2 years but always Teva generic. Oh my God, the Alvogen brand has made me feel so sick. All over severe headache, nauseous, vomiting, diarrhea. I feel awful. No focus, no energy, can't keep anything down, running to the bathroom.	1	February 27, 2021	8
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Been taking adderall for years. Until the had me try a white stop sign shaped one by mallinckrodt since there was an adderall shortage at my Walgreens. mallinckrodt amphetamine/dextroamphetamine shouldn’t even be labeled as amphetamine/dextroamphetamine it should just be sold as a caffeine pill because all it does is wake you up subtlety. It doesn’t help with focus whatsoever. I’ve already filed a complaint with the FDA and recommend everyone else do the same	1	February 25, 2021	20
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I take the 10 mg amphetamine with dextroamphetamine by Teva and it works great, better than the 15 mg.in my opinion. I see others mentioning generics by Alogen and Mallinckrodt here. Well I take a couple of other medications manufactured by these 2, on and off, most times it's Mallickrodt. Let me tell you, this is the WORST drug manufacturer on the market. The Alogen is junk too. I've been on a few medical chat sites just to see what I can find out about Mallinckrodt and see if others felt the same way and they absolutely do! Literally 100's of people have complained to the co. itself and to the FDA. This has been going on for a solid 5 years at least & the stuff is STILL pure unadulterated JUNK.	7	February 21, 2021	25
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Switched from Concerta to Mydayis for the longer duration mechanism Mydayis offers. Was started on 25mg of Mydayis. ADD symptoms improved but I experienced dry mouth, dizziness, heart increase, and appetite decrease which subsided after the first week. Second week I felt like the dose was not effective. Doc switched me to 37.5mg of the mydayis and so far symptoms of ADD improved but side effects are rough. Dry mouth, headache, dizziness, lack of appetite, increased anxiety. I’m on day 4 or 5 so hoping the side effects subside when my body adjusts to the higher dose... fingers crossed.	6	February 20, 2021	4
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I am currently on Adderall XR 30MG, and it has changed so many different aspects of my life, including depression.  I was prescribed Adderall because I was about to be terminated from my job. Back to the drug, I take it around 6am everyday, and found that my overall mood has changed. I am not as emotional as I was before, yet I am still able to express my feelings when necessary without the full breakdowns. I have been dealing with Major Depressive Disorder, and this medication has alleviated most of those feelings.  However, the medication has not been a miracle drug, and it contains no magic! For me, ADD has always been there. For me, it took me to be 36 years old to finally realize it was time to visit a psychiatrist, regardless of all the negative stigmas; I was glad I did, because it gave me many suspected answers, rather than self diagnosing situations.	9	February 15, 2021	17
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’ve taken adderall for years. I used to be on Lannett brand and Walgreens recently switched to TEVA. I had my script switched from CVS to Walgreens because it was closer to me. I have been on it for 3 months and the side effects are TERRIBLE.  I clench my teeth so bad my teeth have broken, I am severely depressed, I can’t find happiness in literally anything. I don’t feel motivated at all. If anything I feel less motivated to get out of bed. My skin is dry, my eyes are sinking in and I get terrible migraines. My anxiety is so bad I’m anti social, and I thought I had a stroke because of side effects. I’m 25. Just don’t take it		February 13, 2021	7
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I take two 30 mg pills a day for ADHD and it has really made a huge difference in my life. I am able to focus on one task at a time and complete it. Works great for giving me the motivation I sometimes lack. Only issue is that when I was given the white or peach ones, they did not seem to work as well as the pink ones. Talked to doctor about it and she added to my prescription to only receive the pink ones. Curious if anyone else has had this issue	9	February 10, 2021	37
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	ALVOGEN INC has got me all messed up. I've taken ADHD meds since 1st grade and I'm 32 now so I'm very confident in my ability to distinguish between generics that work & don't and why. For the past 4 years I've used the same CVS location to fill my Adderall tab 30mg generic the past two times though I received a pill that looked different thinking okay whatever this happens from time to time it is just a different manufacturer no big deal. I was wrong. I have had insanely high blood pressure increases, trouble sleeping, hardly any focus, SEVERE anxiety like where is feel like I can't breathe suddenly especially when I try to sleep, shaky hands, VERY noticeable heart palpitations, diarrhea, headaches and  weird emotional ups & downs. I've been vegan for 3 months now at first I was seeing a steady decrease in blood pressure but as soon as I started taking this new generic I'm topping out at 161/111 at the doctor a few days ago which is just absolutely bonkers and terrifying	2	February 9, 2021	9
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’ve taken TEVA adderall 20 mg IR for the past 2+ years. It worked greatly for my ADD & as an anti-depressant. HOWEVER, it has changed! Starting July 2020, the TEVA tablet was completely different. It was no longer sweet, the consistency was harder & the efficacy was compromised. I can take it & fall asleep hours later & there is ZERO anti-depressant effect. In fact, it deepens my depression.  I will submit a report to the FDA & I encourage everyone else to. Also, please research the complaints of TEVAs other generics. I’m not sure what to try next. I tried the Sandoz and it was actually worse. I received the hideous Zydus once-which gave me a migraine & intensely aching back.I believe it’s manufactured out of this country.  This experience has made me question ALL generic medications.   Please start researching yours & refuse to take these.  I tried switching to name brands but my ins. refuses to pay.	2	February 8, 2021	11
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Have used a generic for about 6 years now worked for me except it has turned me into a teeth grinder I do it all the time and now my teeth are worn to the point they are ruined.  My doctor said he never heard of that side effect but a recent visit to a dentist to try to fix my teeth I was told they see this all the time and this grinding may never go away. I need to find something that works without these side effects	6	February 4, 2021	9
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’ve been in this medication for almost a year . And it change my life in good way. Made me focus on my goals and I want to achieve and increased my motivation to become better person also balance my mood and decreased my depression.	9	January 19, 2021	14
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been taking Teva amphetamine/dextroamphetamine (adderall generic) for quite sometime for ADHD. In the last year, I noticed right away something was off. First was the obvious color. The Teva that has always worked for me with no problems (that was being weaned out in 2019) was as follows..  peach color and sweet, easy to swallow and not gag on. Teva now, is orange. The sweet taste that made it bearable to take has changed completely. My focus, clarity, motivation, and concentration has been/is immensely effected by the new ingredient change. (I don't have it at all)  My overall mental health, has declined quickly. It has caused my mood to completely change, headaches are constant, and upset stomach. All of this, and they don't even work. I struggle everyday now. Less main ingredient and more fillers means more pills can be produced, which means more money in the manufacturer's pocket..... Mental health should be top priority, especially being consistent with and not changing the ingredients.	1	January 17, 2021	51
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	This month is the first time I received sandoz adderall ER and it doesn't seem to work very well for me. Mallinckrodt doesn't seem to work too well for me either. I think Teva seems to work the best for me; even better than the name brand for adderall.	6	January 17, 2021	2
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have suffered with ADHD since I was a young kid, I got diagnosed at the youngest age possible and I never got any help for it by my old doctor.  With my new doctor, he gave me Adderall XR to start out with 10 and than up it to 20 within a week if not effective.   I am on 20 MG now and it has changed my life, I failed school and life because I couldn't pay attention and now not only can I pay attention but this has also helped as my ADHD had caused Depression/Anxiety also OCD.	10	January 15, 2021	14
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Generic Adderall varies significantly depending on mfg. Reason being, the FDA says the mfg only has to “demonstrate” it “works in the same way “ as the brand-name. i.e. generic ingredients do  Not have to be same which is why so many don’t work and/or make people feel sick. My experience, the only generic that works like the brand-name is Prasco, which acquired Teva’s generic xr in 2016.  Few pharmacies use Prasco as their generic because it’s more expensive!  My Dr specifies “Prasco generic only” on my prescription for D-Amphetamine ER 30MG Salt combo. By law, the pharmacy must comply if Prasco is one of their overall suppliers. My insurance changed so I called Prasco to see if they sell to Costco. They do. Just takes a day or 2 for the pharmacist to order and fill my script. Walgreens used Prasco as their generic until recently. Now it’s Mallinckrodt which just filed for bankruptcy to settle a slew of opioid lawsuits. It’s all about $		January 8, 2021	60
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	The adderall name brand is 2-3 times better than generic adderall XR. The FDA should be inspecting these generic companies and make sure they are getting as high of quality ingredients. I urge anyone in generics to try real adderall for a month then decided for yourself. Decide to report the generics because we should be able to get a cheaper still 90$ for generic compared to $220+ for name brand.	10	January 7, 2021	18
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’m a doctor with ADHD. I’ve been on the generics to cut costs during tough times but I insist on the name brand adderall. No only is it smoother it lasts longer and helps even more than the generics. It’s a shame that cost is a bearing on necessary prescriptions and that generic are so much weaker and poorer quality. Generic adderall needs to step it up they have quality issues and their recipe is somehow flawed.	5	January 7, 2021	25
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I've only been taking it for 3 days but I can understand now when people say they feel it running in the background. So far no side effects other than appetite loss. I do feel energy from this but not like Adderall there's no anxiety tied to the energy its more like motivation than energy. One thing I've noticed is I like to always be doing something that is productive in some way. It's not the type of energy you get and use to dance or workout you feel driven to get things done.  It last for the whole 16 hours which surprised me I'm an ultra rapid metabolizer. I have no crash on this like I did with Adderall. I'm just waiting for my period now to see how the cramps are and giving the medicine more time to see if I do have any side effects, so far none but no appetite.	10	January 3, 2021	11
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I've been taking dextroamp-amphet ER 15mg once a day for roughly 3 months now and it's helped me greatly until 2 weeks ago and it's as if I cut my dose by 3/4! Is this normal and what dose, frequency, and type of adderall should I change to? I've heard about generic vs name brand, so what do the best ones look like?	6	December 30, 2020	1
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I've been prescribed adderall for 10yrs+ and without it mentally and physically I would be worse. I do have soreness, achy body, etc but have other health problems. Adderall has ROTTED MY TEETH OUT. Being 42 years old, fear ability to retain with out medicine as I age. I have severe withdrawal, to include extreme fatigue, severe constipation. I need the Adderral and helps some as without it life would be more difficult. All and all I would not manage without it very well but it is less effective as been taking for years. Take care and God Bless All. Be Safe!	7	December 24, 2020	10
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Regarding the post by DrKatz on 11/7/2020:.  I too take the 20 mg salt combo- manufactured by Teva, and have been on that specific brand for two and a half years.  I can definitely concur that something has changed with their product.   I am on a prescription of 80 mg a day and I too noticed a difference in taste, consistency of the pill itself, and it not working as well as it used to.  I am aware of a recall May 22nd by Teva for a few of their doses- the 20mg pill being one of them.   Thinking placebo, I inspected the pill closely: the depression level of the imprint is different, slight change in the oblong shape, the edging* (*like the cut/side profile of floor boards) and thickness + curvature.   The taste difference (bitter) I noticed in August. October back to normal but currently (Nov.) the taste changed again- however this time with a much greater chemical profile- like bactine or rubbing alcohol, more crumbly and not working as well for either my ADHD or narcolepsy.	8	November 15, 2020	29
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’ve been on Adderall XR 20 mg since October 6th 2020. I have to say this medication is life changing and your psychiatrist, doctor or whatever will try and find the right dosage for you. I’m 22 years old, Male and I noticed the medication working within an hour, I’m about 220 pounds 5’8 and despite that it still kicked in relatively fast. The side affects I notice the most are as follows dry mouth, appetite suppression, some irritability, and insomnia on occasion. Adderall XR for me last anywhere from 8-12 hours, if it wears off the medical professional in most cases will add Adderall IR to take in the afternoon, since upping the dose of XR will not increase duration only the intensity of the medication itself. ADHD medication is all about finding what’s right for YOU, don’t give up if it doesn’t get manageable or fixed after the first try.	9	November 8, 2020	42
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have always used Teva Adderall IR because I have had horrible experiences with other generic, including inconsistency and lack of potency.  Understand that I have taken Teva Adderall 20MG tablets over five years, thus it would less difficult for someone like me to detect subtle changes in its effects.  I have noticed the following, and this started around September 2020.  Teva generic Adderall tablets seem (and this is very subtle) smaller in size. Second: Teva is known for its slight sweet taste. It is almost as if that is completely  gone... I’m certainly not saying that added anything to it, but I’m saying it’s an indicator  of some sort of formula change.  Finally, although the 20MG tablet is small, it used to be easy to half the tablet. Recently they just crumble. To summarize, I have also noted a very marked decrease in efficacy.	7	November 7, 2020	26
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Adderall XR is Life changing (positively). I went from being massively distractable and procrastinate constantly to getting things done. I'm not just referring to school work or office work. I mean just showing up on time to meet up with friends. Not getting instantly bored with family.  I truly love it!   --- Quick warning, take it as your doctor recommends! So much of the bad press comes from people abusing the drug.  Likewise, if you're able, take a day off now and then. Perhaps on days when you don't need to work or do much. It's sort of like coffee/tea/caffeine in that sense. Fine if you do take it everyday, but probably best if you give your mind/body a rest from it now & then.  Just like running or exercise, you need light or rest days each week to really get the most from the workout.	10	November 6, 2020	34
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	My grades instantly went from the 60s and 70s to 90s and 100s and for once I felt like I had control over my life. The side effects were pretty bad and inconsistent though, so I had to go from 20 to 15 mg.	9	November 4, 2020	18
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	The Adderal dose my doctor prescribed didn't seem to work that great(20 mg twice a day)  One day I had it after my oatmeal and it was more effective so after that I just scrunched up the pill like I did with oatmeal, but I didn't put it on anything.  I just took it like that. Works great!  Much more motivation to get tasks done so I can finish more!  Maybe you could try that if it sees not enough to work.  I use Sandoz.	10	October 11, 2020	20
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Adderall XR was originally prescribed to me for ADD, but it worked best as a terrific antidepressant.  However, now that I've been on it for 20 straight years at 40-80 mg. Daily, it has very little antidepressant effect now. It's Adderall burnout -- apparently it strips the brain of dopamine -- the feel-good hormone.        I still have to take it just to do anything at all each day.  The worst effect is insomnia -- no matter how early I take it.  It keeps me up for 24 hours unless I finally have to take Seroquel for sleep.  Seroquel is the only thing that will knock out Adderall XR.  But I hate it because it makes me so damn sluggish in the morning, awful.        I cannot believe it's 2020, and there is still no decent antidep medication available,	8	October 1, 2020	31
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	The last 9 months generic “Zydus” was the only brand of amphetamine/dextroamphetamine available in my area. I noticed pretty nasty side effects beginning 45 minutes after consumption. I’ve never felt depression so severely before taking Zydus. Teva/Barr has returned. Felt a night and day difference the first day. Hope Zydus gets banned for the safety of us all.	1	September 23, 2020	20
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Stressed and depressed and always angry.	7	September 21, 2020	23
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I switched over to Mydayis in hope of finding something that could last the entire day. My days are usually nonstop for approx 16 hours. I started at the lowest dose and went up to the 50mg after 3 weeks. Gave it a few more weeks in hopes that it would work like how we wanted it to. The negative side effects outweigh the positives. The first thing I noticed was ejaculatory anhedonia. It led to an unplanned pregnancy before I caught it. The rest included falling behind in classes and not being able to keep up at work. Felt lazy and not wanting to do anything. It was like being unmedicated all over again!	4	September 21, 2020	8
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Generic Adderall:  TEVA vs. ALVOGEN “All generic adderall is NOT the same trust me!...... I don’t care what your physician or pharmacist may say.“  I’ve taken Adderall for nearly 25 plus years for ADD.  WHY? it works twice as good ask anyone whose taken different brands before. For the BEST quality and most potent adderall on the market is made by a company called TEVA.  Even pharmacist tell me when they run out of TEVA and must use ALVOGEN their patients complain because the pharmacies cannot keep TEVA in stock because the consumers know it’s the best and most effective for ADD and ADHD.	1	September 15, 2020	133
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have taken both Adderall and its generic(amphetamine/dextroamphetamine) for over 16 years for my Adult Attention Deficit Disorder. I have found that the original Adderall has the best effectiveness and in these last 4 tears Teva [still oval, peach/orange color] working the best for my A.D.D. Pills made by Mallinkrodt I only get by mistake, and still act like a placebo in May 2020. Dose: 20mg. X 2 daily.		August 25, 2020	24
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I do not like this formula. I have been on various generics for years and did not feel like this 10 mg did anything. Unfortunately, I've already filled this prescription and am stuck with this medication.	1	August 24, 2020	7
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been taking Adderall for most of my adult life and Walgreens always carried the generic version that worked best for me but recently they changed who they get it from now and the new amphetamine / dextroamphetamine from Lannett MFG SUCK!  They do not work at all - actually the worst next to the  YELLOW ROUND Mp 447's, PINK ROUND Cor 136's, or OCTAGON WHITE ONES.   The TEVA amphetamine/dextroamphetamine Peach Oval B 974's are the ones that work best for me and now I don' t know how to get them - Help..	10	June 16, 2020	94
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	My concern in taking generic Adderall IR for several years is the effect is has on my heart  When I take it, at the prescribed dose,  I most always have sinus tachycardia  (a heart rate above 100 beats per minute)  I also have noticed that it effects bladder emptying....and my urinary stream seems slower (and I am fairly young) and I am not usually able to completely empty my bladder.	6	June 10, 2020	26
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Since the shortage for about 3 months I've been taking generic Zydus 20mg. How do these drugs pass inspection? I think a couple pixie sticks would work better. I wonder if generic adderall from any manufacturer will ever get better. I think charging over $5.00 for this rubbish should be criminal.	1	June 7, 2020	40
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	This medication amphetamine/dextroamphetamine has made me feel VERY JITTERY and sick to my stomach! I take generic TEVA brand orange tab 30 mg. The pharmacy didn’t have any of the TEVA brand so they gave me generic U31 tablet - Aurolife Pharma, LLC brand. This is horrible! People take time off work to be seen by doctor, get put on meds for a reason, spend money for the appointment and meds, all the time you spend doing this & it can’t be returned back to Walmart to get my right medicine because “it’s against the law” supposedly! Even when I have the entire prescription (minus one) to give them back. Why make people feel like this when they do so much to try and make life easier being on their meds. I don’t have insurance so my doc visit is almost $100 & medicine is around $60 every month. My 7 year old daughters meds were switched as well. I’m scared to even give her medicine! How can Walmart just give you a different brand that you’ve never taken and not tell me before I leave it’s different!?	1	June 5, 2020	67
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I am a male in my thirties. Adderall is the third drug I tried to tread ADHD after doing trials on Vyvanse and Concerta. Vyvanse worked but did not last long enough and I had bad crashing (headache, exhaustion). Concerta did not work for me at all, made me lethargic and even more distracted.  Adderall at 20mg a day gives me energy to focus on work and my kids. It lasts me until sometime in the evening. I have trouble sleeping some nights on it, other than that the side effects are negligible.	8	May 3, 2020	43
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Activist Dextramp-amphet ER (30 mg.) [ generic for Adderall ]  is HORRIBLE. NOT effective. Causes nausea. HORRIBLE. I have taken this drug for over 3 years and I know what it is supposed to do.	1	April 30, 2020	40
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Adderall is very useful but recently I was ignorant and thought it would be okay to take a little extra at night to help clean my house. I took a bigger extra dose then I should have and a few hours later I felt pretty awful. I am very productive and more positive on the right dose of this med, so I recommend trying it or Desoxyn, because it is said to have fewer side effects like anxiety and panic and irritability post dose. Like all meds, Adderall is a blessing when dosed right and a curse when dosed incorrectly. I noticed that I paced around a bit when on it but I didn’t feel that anxious. It isn’t fun and enjoyable to take a big dose, don’t do it. God made everything to be used in moderation and it is much better for the whole society when we obey the wise instructions of our doctors and leaders. Be careful, obey your doctor, and may God bless you all to succeed in your treatment plans and in your lives. Amen	8	March 18, 2020	74
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	These batches have to improve. I can't even focus on anything and have narcolepsy.	1	March 10, 2020	35
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Recently changed pharmacies and didn't realize that there can be quite a difference between generics. For 4 years I’ve taken adderall 2x day, 10 mg. Never any problems until I switched pharmacies to save $.  Elite Pharma is who makes this new one and it is NOT GOOD.   I am lethargic, unable to focus, quite sleepy.  It’s as if I haven’t even taken anything.  Incredibly frustrating as I am not even half way through this months supply.	1	March 7, 2020	50
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	The generic manufacturer of amphetamine & dextroamphetamine, Sandoz, is the only one that works for me. This month the manufacturer is Northstar and last month Aurobindo, and they are garbage. They don’t help AT ALL with my focus. Zero.  I am irritable. I am getting nothing done and my anxiety is sky high. I am going to stop taking these brands and ask pharmacy for Sandoz.  I complained to the FDA and urge others to do so as well. This is ridiculous.	1	March 3, 2020	70
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Adderall has worked great for me when taken as needed. When I was in my early 20’s and taking it daily I built up a dependence that lead to terrible withdrawals as it is very addictive. (Learned the hard way and never want to go through that again!)  I will usually only take this when my ADHD symptoms are unbearable and my work/personal life starts to become affected. We are talking maybe 1-4 tablets max per month.  It really does help with focus and energy, and I find that one 10-20mg dose is usually enough and I feel good for several days after the dose without any withdrawals or dependence issues.

ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	If you're taking for ADHD please note there are a lot of side effects, having said this, they are sometimes serious so take note to talk to your doctor. If you get cold fingers or toes, make sure to consult your doctor as it's a syndrome that can be prevented.  It does help with focus, it helps with impulse control, it helps with a general overall euphoric feeling and it can cause you to lose a lot of weight. Be sure to eat, EAT, don't shake your head, you know I'm talking to you. Eat and stay hydrated it causes you to urinate a LOT, make sure to supplement what you are losing. It will cause tremors, shakes, and irritability, again, eat food. Make sure to stick to a 2000 calorie diet AT LEAST. May cause muscle fatigue and extreme soreness, stay hydrated, make sure of this.  Some say it causes better grades in school, well, to an extent. It just makes you write a lot. Eat Eat Hydrate And maybe take melatonin to help promote rest. I warned and entertained you.	7	February 21, 2020	97
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	My daughter developed tardive dyskinesia, a permanent drug-induced movement disorder, while on Adderall. If your kid has ODD, stay away from all stimulates; they are most at-risk.	1	February 19, 2020	26
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I totally agree that the new A 79 generics are no good.  I mean they work a little bit, but I feel taking the same amount of the other oblong orange ones that taste like sweet we’re way better.  These taste like nasty chalk.    I’ve never had adderal brand though so I wouldn’t that difference.	3	February 19, 2020	25
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been on  adderal 15mg 2×daily  for 7 yrs it has completely change my life.  I  was always down, depressed, unmotivated, impulsive, always day dreaming, short attention span, no focus and couldn't sitting still. Adderal has given me a new happy life that I can enjoy and appreciate. Starting to think I need to go up to 20mg. I can feel I'm getting used to them. But without them I wouldn't get out of bed and would waste my life.I  think adderal is my miracle drug I have never been so grateful for a prescription drug	10	February 17, 2020	111
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I was diagnosed with ADHD combined type and have tried Ritalin and Focalin. Both weren't that great for me so my doctor prescribed me 10 mg of Adderall XR. Adderall has made me have better multitasking skills and helped me pay attention. It hasn't really helped with being hyper or being impulsive and has given me bad twitching eyes. It also has made my sleep schedule weird so watch out for that.	6	February 6, 2020	23
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Picked up amphetamine with dextroamphetamine medicine 1/24/20, bottle said Barr brand? But Teva tabs were inside. Teva bought Barr in 07. Before Teva bought out multiple companies and started using their ingredients within the last 2-3 years, they were great. Sandoz and Corepharma have been the only other decent makers, before they were bought out. I haven’t noticed a thing from picking these up 1/24. The worst medicine I’ve had from Teva in 8 years.	1	February 4, 2020	36
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	On 1/24/2020 I received Teva generic IR Adderall like I usually have for the last 7 years off and on (used to be good.) Except Barr was labeled on the bottle for the first time ever. Not sure why since Teva bought Barr in 07. Regardless it isn’t any better, by far the worst I’ve had of Teva. But every other company is pathetic. Brand works 10X better but 10X pricier. If the FDA enforced the rule of not less than 80% and no more than 125% concentrated effectiveness, that would be a first! The right MG of each dose might be regulated, but the fillers/inactive ingredients added is the big issue. 1-3 used to be in the old Barr/ Shire/ Sandoz/ Core and those worked fantastic. Every generic now has 5-8 fillers that make it less effective but also cause severe side effects. FDA could care less about small market drugs.	1	February 3, 2020	50
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Game changer. First DX by A pdoc: ADHD. What, no?  Yes.  I felt like I was only working with one puzzle piece and finding out about ADHD was like being given the other 999 pieces. At first Adderall IR didn’t seem to do much but I slowly realized it was like putting emotional and mental blinders on where I could see the rest of the world but mainly focus on the task at hand. Job saver for sure.  Since I have a high tolerance to meds XR saved me from constantly trying to remember to take next dose when I started crashing. Tops.	10	February 3, 2020	30
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have found the generic brand for Adderall is not effective as the brand name. The Epic brand caused me to have severe depression, blurred vision, headaches, very tired and no focus at all.  I’m trying to find a brand that is much like the name brand. Looking for suggestions if anyone can share please. Thanks	1	January 29, 2020	97
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I went to pharmacy to pick up my Adderall generic brand Zydus. I was told they was out of my brand. I was given the Epic brand. The Epic brand caused me to have severe depression and I stayed in bed, I’ve always been very energetic. I stopped taking it. I called the Pharmacist and reported the side effects I had. Pharmacist didn’t act surprised at all, stated we are out of your regular brand and probably won’t get it back in.	1	January 28, 2020	18
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Generics make me feel ill, sometimes headache, sometimes itching or hives.  Google where generics are made.	1	January 24, 2020	45
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	"I was so glad to see these posts.  Pharmacies are so rude to me. I switched to so many brands, but they say they are all alike, and say it doesn't matter which generic I get, because they're all the same.  My doctor, unfortunately, thinks the same.  I finally said to the pharmacy tech one day, ""I'm sure I'm not the only one, who would like certain generics."" She said, no, I'm the only one. I know this sounds crazy, but the blue 10mg of teva, don't seem to work like the 15mg of the peach teva, even if I cut one of the blue in half to make it 15mg."	8	January 23, 2020	92
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I was taking 15mg of generic Adderall  amphetamine / dextroamphetamine  for 3 months and by the end of the 3rd month I had 3 separate people tell me I didn't seem myself. I'm a regularly joyful and excited person but every emotion I had felt muted or stunted while on amphetamine/dextroamphetamine. I stopped talking it and 3 days later felt so much better. I was joyful again! Back to pinging all over the place but at least I'm happy doing it lol. I'm trying Concerta next.	4	January 21, 2020	3
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Ok so I have Both Narcolepsy/Extreme Fatigue & ADD. The generic forms of Adderall (amphetamine and dextroamphetamine) seem to be getting worse and worse. They are making them with obviously cheaper so-called similar ingredients but the new generic amphetamine and dextroamphetamine drugs just have bad side effects and don’t work for me at all or are far less effective. I don’t know if it is Teva brand that is making these cheap ineffective knock-offs that cause migraines & other side effects but they are definitely not working or decent. The generic form Amphetamine Salts works just fine for me but again I think when Teva took over and apparently used far cheaper Ingres there is definitely a disconnect because I don’t think Dextroamp-Amphetamin is a worthy generic form of Adderall but maybe just because Teva brand seems to be using incredibly cheap ingredients,	10	January 20, 2020	21
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I've had ONE DOSE.  Let me be clear.  I took one 25mg pill 6 hours ago and I'm so sleepy I can't see straight.  I slept 7.5 hours last night so I don't understand the drowsiness.	5	January 9, 2020	33
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’ve been on adderall for a few years now and it was life changing. I’ve always been prescribed a generic and have never had a problem until recently. I noticed that I was not getting the same benefit as I was previously and for months, tried to convince myself that it was in my head and then one month, I noticed everyday that I felt great! Looked at the pill imprint and what do you know - it was a different manufacture (Amneal) than the one I was taking. I started googling it and saw a lot of complaints for generic Adderall from Global Pharmaceutical. I’m talking to pharmacist today about it and requesting the generic by Amneal Pharmaceuticals. I thought they were all the same and it’s a shame that global can make these any less effective than what they should be. Is it so people go to their dr, say they don’t feel the effects of it and get an increase? Sounds like a big pharma thing to do. Trust your gut instinct because you’re the person who knows you best.	1	January 8, 2020	17
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	"I recently was given this new form of adderall from the pharmacy which was circular with just an ""A"" on one side... I did not like this new form of Adderall at all!! I assumed it would have the same effect as the typical oval shaped and it was completely different which is a little scary. It was very bitter and gross tasting unlike the football shaped one has a sweet note. It also disintegrated turning to powder immediately, as I attempted to break it in half (waste of product). I did not get any focus from it nor did I feel any different at all?? It did nothing! Then the next day got a horrible headache! I was talking with a friend who also mentioned getting the same thing recently. He mentioned having an extremely bad headache too the following day, so we now know it's from this form of adderall. I DO NOT LIKE IT. It should be pulled from the market honestly I don't know what the heck this rubbish  is but it is not adderall."	2	January 2, 2020	79
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Was first diagnosed with ADD(inattentive type) by multiple doctors at 18 years old. Out of the gate they prescribed me 60mg IR amphetamine with dextroamphetamine. I am now 26, taking 80mg/day, and have learned a substantial amount about this drug. No it won't make you any smarter or develop hidden talents, most believe this. The generic (dextroamphetamine-amphetamine IR) is cheaper than its brand (Adderall xr.) Obviously brand is set to higher standards of quality than generics, so yes brand name anything works better than generics, it's common sense. If you use it correctly and find the right manufacturer like Teva, you most likely won't find as many negatives as most people.	8	December 30, 2019	9
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’ve been taking the generic version of Adderall for about 2 years now. I was tired all the time and couldn’t focus. I felt like a slug and when I had energy I still had brain fog, and had a hard time studying. In class, I would fidget in my chair, doodle, and listen to lectures, but nothing would stick in my head. No matter how long I studied.  I was prescribed the 7.5 mg tablet once a day and just the small dose did wonders for my energy levels and let me focus and actually get things done. It helped me talk in social situations and gave me a mood boost.  That being said, The generics changed a couple times. And I’m not sure, but I think I can tell a difference between them. After the pill wears off, my head aches, my legs throb, my body aches, and I’m nauseous and feel sick. I have flu like symptoms, which are miserable. It’s sad because it’s a really small dose and helps me so much but some of the side effects suck. You just gotta see what’s worth it to you.	8	December 24, 2019	61
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	This medication does not work at all now.	1	December 2, 2019	49
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Not very effective; I took a  double dose which cause headaches and made me generally feel ill.  There are  better generics. Company should not be allowed to sell this medication.	1	November 17, 2019	13
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been on Adderal 10 mg for three months now. I have found it helps me so much in the morning. I need to talk to my doctor and see if I can get something for the afternoon. It's been a godsend but I don't have any anger issues just a lot of anxiety. I'm on Xanax as well three times a day and Ambien for sleep which really helps bed by 5 clock I'm wore out. And then my symptoms seem to return. I would recommend this to anyone that has concentration issues. I'm 41 years old and when I went to school they always called you slow. Which always made you look bad. I think my doctor he's wonderful and I'm going to get my Xanax upped and see if I can get something for the afternoon due to that I work many hours a day and I have to be on my toes.	9	November 2, 2019	6
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I got diagnosed with ADHD at the beginning of this school year, being my senior year of high school. Since 8th grade, I've struggled in school, been incredibly impulsive, had very strange eating habits, over-thought everything, and could never contain my anger or anxiety. Once prescribed, my life has changed. My grades went up, and in 3 months I've lost almost 30 pounds (I am still in the normal BMI range). I can control myself. I finally believe in myself because of Adderall.	9	October 29, 2019	80
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Well been on and off Adderall or Ritalin since I was 5. I'm 62 now, and take 60mg XR morning and two 30mg IR in the afternoon. For me it's a Godsend. I can pay attention now,  I'm more sociable, I'm just.......me.	8	October 23, 2019	22
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’m 48 yo woman that was diagnosed with ADHD in elementary.  When I began (on holiday) taking it I’m extremely fatigue/zombie the first 3 days, I am not nearly as engaged with anyone/anything around me (I talk 97% less when I’m on Adderall) and it makes me feel less cognitive.  I feel like it dumbs me down.  After the 3rd day I start to feel better and those “tranquilizer effects” go away. Adderall is an emotional regulator for me. It works wonders for my impulsivity, racing thoughts, fidgeting, feeling overwhelmed, anger, anxiety, zoning out, and my mouth. Yes, my mouth has always been my biggest challenge and has caused me tremendous social/professional problems.  While in a perfect world I’d be on no medication, I have to recommend Adderall for anyone whose suffering from ADHD, because  it has changed my overall quality of life for the best.  Sparkle on beautiful people! 	9	October 23, 2019	81
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I was diagnosed with both bipolar and ADHD. After trying multiple combinations, we finally tried adderall on top of Wellbutrin, Lamictal, and Fluvoxamine for OCD. At first, the adderall did wonders. Completely made me enjoy life again. However, as my tolerance increased, the adderall crash was very intense. It resulted in a bipolar low almost everyday around the same time. I recently just switched to Stratetta and is my second day taking it. Anxious to see how this works.	9	October 22, 2019	29
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’ve been taking meds for ADHD/ADD close to 8 years now.  Tried Adderall at many dosages, types and amount of times per day over a period of many years.  My biggest issue. I forgot to take them.  Tried Vyvanse. It helped but I got nauseous, dizzy every day.  Tried Adderall again and forgot to take them.  One day my doctor mentioned Mydayis. I wouldn’t have to remember taking more than one in the AM.  After a week I could tell that it was helpful but wasn’t able to tell if a BIG difference.  I ran out due to scheduling once & my brain went into hyper drive. I hadn’t felt that chaotic for awhile.  WHILE talking to my doctor she legit wrote out the prescription, handed it to me. ‘go fill it NOW.’ Even had others asking how long I would be without it.  It was clear it helped at that point.  I don’t notice any side effects.  My results with Mydayis are pretty good. No worries of forgetting it, which was the major factor in my switch.	8	October 20, 2019	11
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I'm making this review one year after trying Mydayis for only a week. I switched to this drug from Adderall IR 20's BID to the 37mg capsule, you don't really think your buzzing, but you indeed are, and more so than with Adderall for the same dose. What prompted me to write this review was that I noticed someone else who reviewed this mentioned that they would be returning the bottle to the pharmacy because they didn't want insurance to think they were keeping it. This is an effect of the drug, I too, even though I bought it on the $5 coupon, did not want the pharmacy (who does not care) to think that I wanted to keep this drug so I returned the remaining 23 capsules to them. It works well, puts you in a different state of mind, and doesn't provide the sense well being of some other ADHD products offer, but it does work better than some generics. Perhaps give this a try if you're on generics that don't work. It is pretty strong, but doesn't feel like it. if that makes sense.	7	October 14, 2019	12
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I was on 10MG XR for 3 months and it worked amazingly. This is a very good medication if you have trouble functioning like a normal person, although be prepared for really dark thoughts if you decide to stop taking it. Withdrawal from this drug is no joke, it can make you want to die...but if you keep taking it or taper off slowly you should be fine.		October 12, 2019	22
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I was diagnosed with ADD in 2005 after experiencing horrible distractibility in class while at college and not being able to focus on a single thought in my head.  I was prescribed Adderall IR and I remember feeling like I had drunk 5 Red Bulls or something!  My heart was pounding and I had horrible anxiety the whole day.  I only took it one time.  I decided to get off it immediately.  Soon after, I was prescribed Strattera, which didn't do ANYTHING.  I've gone for about 13 years without actual ADD medications because I really hated the idea of stimulants.  That all changed when I realized my ADD was getting out of control.  I saw my current psychiatrist last week who re-diagnosed me and we discussed my experiences.  I had read reviews from people here who say that Dexedrine works for them if Adderall made them too wired, so I asked if I could try that.  I just tried it today and I had no horrible side effects - no anxiety, no heart palpitations, no edginess, etc.  It is wonderful!	1	October 9, 2019	21
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have suffered my entire life with ADD.  For a while Adderal helped. Then as I turned 49 it seemed to make me more anxious, irritable,  short tempered, and I had No patience for stupidity! Upon trying the Mydayis,  I was immediately impressed. I was finishing projects.  Getting things done right! Able to focus for longer durations of time. Long enough to complete tasks at hand. I feel so much better.	10	October 3, 2019	30
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I will never give this to my child again!, I know all children are different but I'm sticking with Dyanavel XR. While he was on Adderall he was acting angry and violent, like he was on some kind of illegal drug, his facial expressions were intense, and he could not sit still, and was very emotional. so I have to give this a 1 star on my personal experience and my son's	1	October 2, 2019	35
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I've had a prescription for amphetamine with dextroamphetamine for  four years, and Teva used to work fairly well for me. Over the last year or so, it's become awful. I know it isn't me, because I still have old (2-3 years) pills laying around; I tried some of them and they work just fine.   Teva changed something in the manufacturing process. The new pills do almost nothing beneficial (I feel sleepy all day), but they have a ton of side effects. I feel very jittery, my stomach hurts, and I've been experiencing bloating.	1	September 30, 2019	23
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Overall, 20 mg Adderall XR for ADHD helps me to focus. The problem with adderall is it makes me sweat something awful. Anyone else annoyed with sweating while taking adderall?	9	September 28, 2019	62
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Well first off. Adderall is an Amphetamine  which assist with the production of dopamine. Very close  relation to meth. I am 21 years old and I started Adderall again. Previously I was on Adderall from age 8-13 and it worked great. Some say ADHD is not real and it just a symptom of bad health etc... I have been very very healthy and unhealthy which produced no changed in brain fog. Now that engineering is my main task in like I seem to have a hefty amount of brain fog. Adderall does in fact help with focus but the downside is the extreme crashes that happen when you stop taking it.	8	September 26, 2019	20
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been on Adderall for quite sometime. It has helped me focus and also being proactive. I recently got a new script and diff manufacturing teva  I noticed since I have taken it I'm extremely tired. Cannot focus at all I feel like a scatter brain..I had to call my dr to have him rewrite a new script and surrender the Teva (amphetamine with dextroamphetamine) Did anyone get the same reaction?	1	September 26, 2019	20
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I shared my experience recently on here and was going back over and reading others as well.  I believe we should all state the laboratory that producing the specific generic we are each taking. Doing so may help us all narrow down which ones to stay away from and which ones are truly therapeutic.  Eon lab  brand of amphetamine/dextroamphetamine was good until 9 months ago, now they are horrible (no therapeutic value and bad side effects).  I then I switched to Teva and they were decent for about 2 months and now they are giving me side effects.  Plus the pharmacy ran out of them and I had to wait for a new batch and when the new batch came in is when the bad side effect started.  I KNOW the drug manufacturer has changed something.  Hope that helps someone.	2	September 24, 2019	122
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	So, I have had ADHD since I was like young. I never liked the pills they gave me when I was younger because I was already a thin kid and then taking Adderall I would eat even less. So I stopped taking the medication. When I was taking this medication I got most improved student! I went without the drug for years, until just about 2 years ago I started taking it again and It has helped me so much! I am very thankful for this drug. I suffer from fatigue , and many, many other problems. This drug is one of many I NEED, To Think Straight and to not get outta control.  It also helps me BIG TIME with my anger issues. Hope this helps someone! Star Kid Is OUT!	9	September 11, 2019	47
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	This drug is one of the greatest formulas of all time. I went from down and depressed and unmotivated to organized and focused. Also from relatively poor to rich due the effect it had on me with my enthusiasm for work	10	September 11, 2019	57
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I cannot believe that the FDA allows AUROBINDO or TEVA to sale their lousy drugs through pharmacies in the US.  Neither of these generics have any affect on me at all!!  WASTE of money!   They are playing with people's minds and well being!!!!	2	September 6, 2019	110
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Have taken Adderall on and off for around 13 years for ADD and CFS. I was lucky enough to have tried the “real” brand Adderall by Barr laboratories. I’ve never taken over 20mg a day. This medicine has gone to TRASH.The only negative side affect from the Barr version was occasional jaw clinching.   I think Teva must’ve burned the patent formula or something because it has never worked liked the Barr, not even close.  So many negative side effects (migraine headaches, heartburn, nausea)! I keep hoping at some point they might magically start producing a decent version that actually helps instead of hurts.  The original Barr had true therapeutic value.  Eon labs produced a decent generic for a while, but BAM, it suddenly went to garbage at the end of 2018.  So switched back to Teva a couple months back and it started ok( not as good as Eon but better than everything else out there), then last months refill is feeling like they’re changing to something bad too.  Bring back real Adderall!	3	September 4, 2019	78
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I had taken Adderall for many years and was slowly on the decline.  I was deeply depressed and had an absolute hopeless and helpless outlook on life with no relief. I had psychosis, delusions and impulsive behavior which I never had. I began having issues with memory, thinking, reasoning, decision making, tasks, and  concentration.  I would become very agitated if being interrupted. I was very aggressive and agitated constantly, it was at least 98% of the time in 10 years.  I read horror stories about stimulants, namely the Amphetamine line of them. I subsequently tapered off of them and feel 100% better than before. I have no depressive symptoms, delusions, memory problems, agitation or aggressiveness. I was not happy with life and my personal relationships were very toxic. I wasted almost 10 years of my life feeling like this and have other personal complications that resulted from the use of these toxic drugs.	1	August 28, 2019	29
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I'm all shook up. But it works!	9	August 26, 2019	20
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Works well for my adult ADHD. It gets me motivated, and I can feel it kicking in. The perfect dosage for me is the 15mg tablet, morning, and another 15mg after lunchtime! I score the 30mg tablet in half.	9	August 22, 2019	6
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I've had ADHD since I was a kid and after a couple of years taking Ritalin I stopped and then tried it again once in my 20's and again in my 30's but never liked the way it made me feel. Starting in my late 30's I started to suffer from chronic fatigue syndrome which doesn't mix well with ADHD. It puts the body and mind in a bad place. I finally got around to going to the doctor and he recommended that I take Adderall 3 times a day. This has been such a benefit to my life. Not only do I have the energy to get out of bed I can now focus enough to get some daily life stuff done.	10	August 13, 2019	9
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	First prescribed it in grad school for ADD & depression. Worked wonders. Only downside is I became very reliant on it. Was stuck between the two evils of being a depressed zombie (w/o taking it) and feeling like a happy, motivated, focused person (on Adderall). Eventually stopped taking and failed out of grad school. Work was hard, always late, made stupid mistakes, & couldn’t complete tasks. 3 years & 3 jobs later, I broke down and went back to a doctor who rediagnosed me with ADD, Anxiety, & Depression. I was reluctant to start back on Adderall and tried a few alternatives first. Everything made me feel even MORE exhausted; back on Adderall 30mg day; feel normal again. I have the motivation, energy, & focus to complete tasks. Only complaint is anxiety which I resolve w/ a low benzo & exercise. Remember, there’s no reason to be miserable if there’s a pill out there that can change your life.	7	August 10, 2019	103
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	"I've finally found it. - Mydayis it is that little reminder I never had; the missing piece of my conscience that was never there before to tell me ""stop mucking and go do the stuff you should be getting on with"""	7	August 5, 2019	31
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	This medicine initially seemed to work very well for me with improved concentration but after taking it for only 6 months I discontinued it due to anxiety levels being through the roof to the point where I couldn’t function. This was enhanced during social interactions of which is ironic because I know many people say they experience increased desire for social activities. A month after stopping medicine, I started experience psychotic symptoms of which have not subsided. I do not suggest this medicine.	4	August 3, 2019	18
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I'm 19. I've tryed a lot of ADHD medication (I'm from Canada so I have less option than the US). Concerta, Biphentin, Vyvanse. With all these medication I've experienced sides effects, or, in the case of Vyvanse, I was not focused enough. And now I'm on Adderall XR and I can tell you than is the best ADHD medication I've tried. I feel like I can multi-task like Vyvanse but more focus, and this focus make all the difference. I don't feel a lot of sides effects, and they are nothing if I compare with Concerta or Biphentin. and Adderall XR is one of the only ADHD medication with generic availability in Canada!	9	August 2, 2019	23
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Adderall X R 30mg in the morning along with 5mg of Adderall in the early afternoon seem to help my mood and condition dramatically. If you are ADHD I recommend talking with your psychiatrist.	10	August 2, 2019	24
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Started off with  Adderall  5 mg IR twice daily.  Overall, this is a very low dose.  I have found it was more effective and safer to take it every couple of days.  At least for me.  I have tried 40mg and 60mg before so I am very aware of how intense it can be.  If you take it every day you will end up increasing the dosage.  Try to use it sparingly and try doing activities that produce dopamine naturally like exercise or walking and listening to music.  This will help you feel healthier while taking it.  Overall I think it is helpful but definitely feels unnatural and can't believe they give speed to children.  	5	July 30, 2019	35
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I asked my doctor about Mydayis because it lasts 16 hours.    The first week I was so calm, never been so calm in my life, even with antidepressants. I was able to focus during conversations. I organized my desk (a little). Cleaned my car out (a little). My second week i was still focusing but I couldn't eat. I was repulsed by anything other than fruits, vegetables, cereal. But then I felt dizzy...sick to my stomach. My eyes seem to move involuntarily   Nystagmus )mand I got the worst eye strain I've ever had. My neck muscles felt extremely tight and I just kept massaging my neck trying not to panic. I tried to tough it out for the next 2 days but could not. It's been day 2 days since I quit taking it and my eyes are still involuntarily moving a little. I had big hopes for this med but this is how it worked it for me and I was only taking 12.5 mg.  I just needed to let everyone know about this possibility because I couldn't find any info about it. It would probably be considered a tic.	3	July 27, 2019	28
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Diagnosed ADD 18 y/o, on and off Adderall IR since then. Too high a dose causes psychosis...be forewarned. I used to be on 30mg 3x/day, now I'm leary of taking more than 2.5mg 2x/day. Maybe it builds up in the brain, so be sure to take breaks from it often. I notice the side effects outweigh the benefits at higher doses....irritability, zombie-like come-down. My insurance only covers this and Ritalin, so I'm stuck with bad side-effects.	4	July 23, 2019	19
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	"Adderall is literally the only THING Period that I have tried that has improved my life in the slightest (I have ADD/Treatment-Resistant Depression ) - I got my Bachelors degree in Health & Psychology, I tried EVERY supplement herb, nootropic, etc. I'm commenting here is because of all the people saying how it drained them, or over time began making them feel worse - you need to educate yourself - one of the most important being, be SURE to be supplementing with TYROSINE, literally daily (tyrosine converts into Dopamine - like how 5-HTP converts to Serotonin) just like how SSRI's eventually ""poop out"" and just stop working (because they've used up the bodies natural serotonin) Adderall will eventually ""poop out"" on you, stop working, yet even worse when this happens, the more you take the WORSE you feel because its like revving an engine with no gasoline left in it!!! Theres plenty more to look into but even just taking Tyrosine makes a HUGE difference!"	8	July 19, 2019	97
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Adderall is all fun and games until you become addicted and try to stop taking it. I loved and still love Adderall, just like all of the positive reviews here - it works like nothing else, but I will never take it again.  I quit Adderall June of 2018 and it was the worst thing I ever went through - everything you read online about stimulant withdrawal is true x100. It’s almost impossible to successfully wean off of this medication. I went cold turkey 3x before I was finally successful.  It took me months to feel “normal” again.  During this time my life went downhill and I started up again December 2018 at a low dose, which before I knew it increased back to me 40mg dose.  I just quit Adderall again because I will be trying to get pregnant at the end of this year and it was once again a battle but I managed to do it. I will NEVER go back on this medication. Ever. It took me 2 hard lessons to realize how bad this medication is for you and your brain.	1	July 17, 2019	3
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I do not recommend anyone taking Adderall. I was unable to eat or sleep while taking this medication. It caused severe stunting of my growth.	1	July 17, 2019	8
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	"I have always known that I had ADD. However, I was in grad school, and I was studying for up to 10-12 hours a day. I found myself reading and re-reading and was having a hard time retaining information, because I couldn't stay focused. I would study for hours. Long story short, for my master's degree, I had to take practice timed test for NP boards, I failed it. My instructor told me to get tested for ADHD,  and get on medications. I did, and it was the best thing I have ever done, and wish I did it sooner, it cut my studying by half, because I'm very focused. I didn't have to request extra time for my NP boards, and I passed with time to spare. I have no side effects; incr. HR, BP, I eat and exercise, and don't take it late in afternoon to avoid insomnia. I only take it when I study and not everyday.  I believe it's about making the drug work for you and not let the drug control you.  Medication ""holidays"" are great to do."	10	July 13, 2019	36
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	If it wasn’t for Adderall I would be a basket case no questions asked. I'm 55 been on it since 2014 on an everyday basis. I'll take a day off every so often, but it's a rare occasion. My Blood Pressure is 122/74- pulse 64 when moving around normally. Resting my BP is lower along with the pulse rate. If you are relatively healthy heart wise no problems. I know one guy who's pushing 76 years old and he's still taking his prescribed dosage.	10	July 8, 2019	35
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	My son developed tics and we stopped the Adderall medication. Tics remain and one day he hit his head until no hair was there. He also now has blood in his stool no one can explain. Hmmm well permanent  damage isn’t worth the education we are providing now. I would rather buy a franchise than a college degree.	1	July 7, 2019	5
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been taking ADHD Medications for years. I have found that the Generic  Adderall ( Extended Release 20 mg) by Amneal Pharmaceuticals LLC. (CAPSULES STAMPED g454) ARE NOT as effective as other brands	2	July 2, 2019	7
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I've been on and off Adderall IR for the last year. When I'm on Adderall the first 3 months is amazing! I feel highly attentive and motivated. I have to take sleep meds because I'm so wired. The negative is the crash I feel by 6pm. It's like I transform into Angry Smurf - no longer talkative or cheerful and forgot about sex -- my libido shut down. My greatest battle is with food.  I am constantly hungry and when I eat the meds seem to lose its potency therefore causing me to skip meals. I built a tolerance rather quickly on this stuff and it lost its efficacy. IN ANY CASE, DO NOT INCREASE YOUR DOSAGES. Instead take a break from Adderall and try another drug for a couple of months.  This drug is not meant for long term use. Just few month. anything longer is just going to create a monster out of you.	6	July 1, 2019	17
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been taking 50mg of Mydayis for a few months now and I have been happy with my experience on this medicine. I have been on several regimens, including Vyvanse 70 + Dexedrine 10 booster, Adderall XR + Dexedrine 10 booster, Adderall xr + adderall 10 booster, Focalin XR, etc but I decided to give Mydayis a go since my new insurance has it covered on its formulary ($50 a month copay). Like others have said this drug runs in the background but I find it much more consistent and wayyyy longer acting than Adderall XR and even longer than Vyvanse, which only lasted 6 hours max for me. I take it at 5:30am and feel the medicine until about 5pm (~10 hours give or take). Mydayis less anxiety-provoking but I still feel like my ADHD symptoms are controlled around the clock and yet at the same time I feel more like myself than I did strung out on the other medicines. If you’re looking for an option that lasts a long while and your insurance will help pay for it I, think it’s a good option.	10	May 1, 2021	0
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have received my second refill of generic Adderall XR 20 mg made by Mallinckrodt and I am extremely unhappy with it. It is not at all effective. I have been on the non-generic Adderall XR for years without issue.	1	April 29, 2021	1
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have taken Adderall XR and short acting for 25 years and I got this new XR 30MG the other day Lannett and it made me tired, heart racing, BP accelerated and did NOTHING to help me focus. I contacted the pharmacy and my Dr and he's trying to switch me to another brand because this is a joke. awful..	1	April 26, 2021	6
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Just started taking adderall XR 10mg after learning I had been mis-diagnosed for 15+ years as either bi-polar, major depressive disorder and social anxiety. I finally found a psychiatrist that really dug deep and concluded I was not bi polar but I suffered from adult ADHD (33 year old male). It makes total sense as I read more about ADHD. I had been on every possible anti-depressant, anti psychotic MDD etc and was just done with meds. I was diagnosed as a child and teen but thought “ I’d grow out of it” and apparently never did it just got worse. I feel that so many people are mis-diagnosed it’s almost unbelievable. My theory and the doctor also said that if you take the medication and it calms you and your racing thoughts that that’s a tell tail sign that you do indeed suffer from ADHD, it’s not just a childhood/school era problem, it disrupts your life, marriage everything. I’m on day 2 and it’s like a light switch has been turned on and I can relax and not be manic.	9	April 25, 2021	4
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been on and off generic Adderall for many years. Currently, I have been prescribed 30 mg twice a day. For the last couple of months, it's been a nightmare. It's been on backorder and then changed the generic name from amphetamine salts combo to amphetamine/ dextroamphetamine combo. This is only because I have had severe headaches, extreme fatigue, and a loss of motivation. My ADHD has been out of the roof. It's frustrating because I feel like I did before taking any generic Adderall. I have even been concerned that maybe I was receiving a placebo rather than the actual medication. That's probably far-fetched, but it's been such a decline for me. There is something missing from this generic form and it is the essential thing that is needed to control my ADHD. I have even gained a lot of weight over the past two months. Hopefully, something will give, I can't imagine it affecting people like this and nothing changing.	3	April 19, 2021	8
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	This pill does not work like any Adderall that I have experienced. There is neither the focus or the energy bump that is typically associated with the two most therapeutic aspects of the formulation. The vast majority of time I feel equally as sleepy and unfocused as I did when I took it.    I am an experienced user of this positive life-changing medication. The patients that us this medication are in a bad position when company’s that make inferior generic medications are allowed distribution rights through equally as corrupt retail pharmaceutical outlets seeking to make a few pennies extra per script, on the back of patients whose experienced opinion is rarely considered.	2	April 17, 2021	2
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have taken ADHD meds many years. Adderall XR is the ADHD med that works the best for me. I am taking a generic manufactured by Lannett. It by far has worked the best for me with the reason(s) being is the smoothness, the come up is very quick, and it does it's job perfectly.   To reiterate, Lannett is very smooth with a quick come up, and last long enough most days.	9	April 15, 2021	4
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	If anyone else is having a terrible time with the new Lannett generic adderall you can report this to the FDA.  I have been having crippling headaches, stomach aches, and the medication doesn’t even feel like it works!!! I get tired after I take it and then can’t sleep all night because of it. HORRIBLE. Google fda medwatch online reporting to fill in the form	1	April 9, 2021	37
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Right now I take 50mg Lamictal for my Bipolar and 7.5mg twice a day Adderall for ADHD. At first I wasn't sure Adderall was going to work for me, I was initially prescribed 20mg twice a day.  That dose ended up being way too high for me, It made be become manic and I felt really wired all the time.  I now take 7.5mg twice a day and have found it to be much better. I feel alert and focused throughout the day.  Some of the side effects I have had are weight loss, jaw clenching, and mild insomnia (I usually just take melatonin). Overall, Adderall has helped me a lot, I just had to find the right dosage.	8	April 8, 2021	0
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been on Adderall for several years and the Sandoz brand is TOXIC and HORRIBLE! At first it is like a sugar pill no effect and then dizziness, headache, feeling more confused, spaced out and mind blank, extreme fatigue. I can't believe this is on the market. FDA honestly needs to step up their game and monitor the generics. It is a up and down roller coaster with different manufactures each month. This is insane. They are robbing us blind in the pharmaceutical business. They give us something toxic or a placebo. What is happening to the medications now. Please do not take the Sandoz. Read the court documents about reviews on them and they came from the company. Making themselves sound great as a pretend customer!! I can not believe how bad this medication from this manufacture is.	1	April 6, 2021	10
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Worked really well for the first week or so, but then really made me more irritable and gave me uncontrollable suicidal urges that ultimately sent me to the hospital. The suicidal urges stopped after dropping the medication.  I wouldn't recommend against the medication, I would just proceed with caution as the side effects can vary in intensity from person to person.	1	April 3, 2021	3
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been prescribed Amphetamine Salt Combo which has worked well(I have ADD and narcolepsy). Today I was given from RX, Amphetamine Aspertate, it make me fell kinda sickness. Was I given the wrong medicine. The prescription has not changed ?	7	April 1, 2021	3
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’ve been on Adderrall immediate release for at least 8 years, probably more. At first Adderrall gave me an intense high and made me very talkative. Very talkative. That lasted for a few days and after that each morning when I took it it gave me a euphoric feeling for about have the day. I wasn’t making impulsive decisions like I had in the past and my focus was razor sharp. I really enjoyed this drug for sometime but the last 3-5 years it’s just been the same old same old. I take it in the morning and have somewhat of a boost in energy and focus but after around 11am the effects of the medication just wears off. I wind up feeling irritable, decent level of focus if I’m busy at work, and just downright not very social with people. This week I’m going to see my P.A. and hopefully get on Vyvanse which I was encouraged by many to try before jumping on Adderrall. Vyvanse is more expensive but I’m ready to feel more focused and more myself.	5	March 28, 2021	4
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	This review is for generic Adderall XR - amphetamine/dextroamphetamine. I've experienced wildly different effects from different manufacturers. Some days it didn't work. Some days it worked great. But I got severe debilitating headaches that lasted 24/7 and didn't go away using ibuprofen. Went to neurologist and got an MRI. If I could push past the side effects it did work well but for only about 4-5 hours after kicking in (which took about an hour). Needed a booster of IR in the afternoon, so eventually I couldn't deal with the headaches and switched to IR completely. Headaches gone almost immediately. I still get them with IR but not anywhere near as often or as bad.	6	March 23, 2021	1
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	"I've tried several ADHD meds and Mydayis has definitely been the best for me. I'm on the lowest dose and it starts working 20-30 minutes after I take it. I'm then able to be productive and direct my focus easily, compared to other meds (eg-Adderall) which gave me a burst of intense focus that I had no control over. The transitions are barely noticeable and it really helps maintain consistent energy levels. After wearing off, it's a very natural ""I've worked all day and now I'm ready to relax before bed"" feeling (no crash). I also noticed it significantly helps manage my depression-something no other ADHD med has done. The only downsides: (1) it does reduce my appetite a lot and (2) it only lasts about 9-10 hours on my current dose (12.5mg), but higher doses (25mg+) give me headaches. It's not perfect, but the positives definitely outweigh the negatives for me. Lastly-you don't know how it'll affect you, so don't let reviews scare you away if you/your doc think it might help."	9	March 21, 2021	4
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I was diagnosed with ADHD at age 17 and only really started taking stimulant medication after I had turned 20 last year. I was originally trying out varying doses of IR but started trying XR in the past few months.  Overall: Hit or miss for me. It does help with my focus, but the side effects and how much it helps varies pretty drastically depending on the day. Biggest side effects are dehydration, lack of appetite, potentially crashing at night (normal). I also feel a bit uncomfortable sometimes (anxiety-ish twitchy feeling) but that's not very common.  The mallinckrodt brand I was switched to recently seems maybe a bit more hit or miss honestly I can't really tell that much of a difference (unlike people on opioids who swear that mallinckrodt is awful). I'm on 25mg for now and I'm gonna keep seeing how I feel in the coming weeks. Helps with ADHD no doubt, but do be weary of the side effects.	7	March 16, 2021	2
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I took Mydayis 37.5 mg for 2 years. I just recently ran out and decided to wait a week to refill. I cannot believe the change in myself! While on it I became withdrawn and too focused on 1 specific thing. I cut out people and ruined my small business. I didn't feel human! I can't explain the feeling but now that I haven't taken it in a week I feel like myself again! I was just flesh living day by day on mydayis! I will NEVER touch it again! Please tell me there's others out there with similar experiences	1	March 12, 2021	5
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	"I have been taking teva 20mg adderall from 06-19 when they disappeared. I had already suffered from side effects from other generics due to CVS giving me a different generic a few times without consent or being informed. I did the whole google wormhole for a few months before finally seeing a random comment about ""INACTIVE"" ingredients and how this person suffered terrible side effects across multiple generic medications with this same ""INACTIVE"" ingredient. Being on multiple meds myself and having autoimmune and neuro disorders it affected my mental health knowing something wasn't right and just not grasping why & not understanding. That random comment changed everything for me ""INACTIVE"" does not equal no effect.  Teva not being an option then and now not at all I use Mallinckrodt and Arubindo 20 mg. I find it helps to switch them every couple months or I take M in the morning and A in the afternoon depending on how my body is functioning. I tried SAndoz that was terrible side effects."	8	March 6, 2021	2
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	My 7 year old son is a first grader and was recently diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. He has been recommended Adderall for this but I am a bit reluctant to initiate its usage. I have a few reservations about how long it lasts in our system which I have heard can prove to be dangerous for a young kid. I have read multiple articles like these, but I am still not so sure. Seeing the number of experienced people here, please tell me if I should continue with it.		March 4, 2021	4
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	First time taking Alvogen generic amphetamine with dextroamphetamine 30mg. Been taking adderall for 2 years but always Teva generic. Oh my God, the Alvogen brand has made me feel so sick. All over severe headache, nauseous, vomiting, diarrhea. I feel awful. No focus, no energy, can't keep anything down, running to the bathroom.	1	February 27, 2021	8
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Been taking adderall for years. Until the had me try a white stop sign shaped one by mallinckrodt since there was an adderall shortage at my Walgreens. mallinckrodt amphetamine/dextroamphetamine shouldn’t even be labeled as amphetamine/dextroamphetamine it should just be sold as a caffeine pill because all it does is wake you up subtlety. It doesn’t help with focus whatsoever. I’ve already filed a complaint with the FDA and recommend everyone else do the same	1	February 25, 2021	20
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I take the 10 mg amphetamine with dextroamphetamine by Teva and it works great, better than the 15 mg.in my opinion. I see others mentioning generics by Alogen and Mallinckrodt here. Well I take a couple of other medications manufactured by these 2, on and off, most times it's Mallickrodt. Let me tell you, this is the WORST drug manufacturer on the market. The Alogen is junk too. I've been on a few medical chat sites just to see what I can find out about Mallinckrodt and see if others felt the same way and they absolutely do! Literally 100's of people have complained to the co. itself and to the FDA. This has been going on for a solid 5 years at least & the stuff is STILL pure unadulterated JUNK.	7	February 21, 2021	25
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Switched from Concerta to Mydayis for the longer duration mechanism Mydayis offers. Was started on 25mg of Mydayis. ADD symptoms improved but I experienced dry mouth, dizziness, heart increase, and appetite decrease which subsided after the first week. Second week I felt like the dose was not effective. Doc switched me to 37.5mg of the mydayis and so far symptoms of ADD improved but side effects are rough. Dry mouth, headache, dizziness, lack of appetite, increased anxiety. I’m on day 4 or 5 so hoping the side effects subside when my body adjusts to the higher dose... fingers crossed.	6	February 20, 2021	4
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I am currently on Adderall XR 30MG, and it has changed so many different aspects of my life, including depression.  I was prescribed Adderall because I was about to be terminated from my job. Back to the drug, I take it around 6am everyday, and found that my overall mood has changed. I am not as emotional as I was before, yet I am still able to express my feelings when necessary without the full breakdowns. I have been dealing with Major Depressive Disorder, and this medication has alleviated most of those feelings.  However, the medication has not been a miracle drug, and it contains no magic! For me, ADD has always been there. For me, it took me to be 36 years old to finally realize it was time to visit a psychiatrist, regardless of all the negative stigmas; I was glad I did, because it gave me many suspected answers, rather than self diagnosing situations.	9	February 15, 2021	17
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’ve taken adderall for years. I used to be on Lannett brand and Walgreens recently switched to TEVA. I had my script switched from CVS to Walgreens because it was closer to me. I have been on it for 3 months and the side effects are TERRIBLE.  I clench my teeth so bad my teeth have broken, I am severely depressed, I can’t find happiness in literally anything. I don’t feel motivated at all. If anything I feel less motivated to get out of bed. My skin is dry, my eyes are sinking in and I get terrible migraines. My anxiety is so bad I’m anti social, and I thought I had a stroke because of side effects. I’m 25. Just don’t take it		February 13, 2021	7
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I take two 30 mg pills a day for ADHD and it has really made a huge difference in my life. I am able to focus on one task at a time and complete it. Works great for giving me the motivation I sometimes lack. Only issue is that when I was given the white or peach ones, they did not seem to work as well as the pink ones. Talked to doctor about it and she added to my prescription to only receive the pink ones. Curious if anyone else has had this issue	9	February 10, 2021	37
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	ALVOGEN INC has got me all messed up. I've taken ADHD meds since 1st grade and I'm 32 now so I'm very confident in my ability to distinguish between generics that work & don't and why. For the past 4 years I've used the same CVS location to fill my Adderall tab 30mg generic the past two times though I received a pill that looked different thinking okay whatever this happens from time to time it is just a different manufacturer no big deal. I was wrong. I have had insanely high blood pressure increases, trouble sleeping, hardly any focus, SEVERE anxiety like where is feel like I can't breathe suddenly especially when I try to sleep, shaky hands, VERY noticeable heart palpitations, diarrhea, headaches and  weird emotional ups & downs. I've been vegan for 3 months now at first I was seeing a steady decrease in blood pressure but as soon as I started taking this new generic I'm topping out at 161/111 at the doctor a few days ago which is just absolutely bonkers and terrifying	2	February 9, 2021	9
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’ve taken TEVA adderall 20 mg IR for the past 2+ years. It worked greatly for my ADD & as an anti-depressant. HOWEVER, it has changed! Starting July 2020, the TEVA tablet was completely different. It was no longer sweet, the consistency was harder & the efficacy was compromised. I can take it & fall asleep hours later & there is ZERO anti-depressant effect. In fact, it deepens my depression.  I will submit a report to the FDA & I encourage everyone else to. Also, please research the complaints of TEVAs other generics. I’m not sure what to try next. I tried the Sandoz and it was actually worse. I received the hideous Zydus once-which gave me a migraine & intensely aching back.I believe it’s manufactured out of this country.  This experience has made me question ALL generic medications.   Please start researching yours & refuse to take these.  I tried switching to name brands but my ins. refuses to pay.	2	February 8, 2021	11
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Have used a generic for about 6 years now worked for me except it has turned me into a teeth grinder I do it all the time and now my teeth are worn to the point they are ruined.

ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been taking Teva amphetamine/dextroamphetamine (adderall generic) for quite sometime for ADHD. In the last year, I noticed right away something was off. First was the obvious color. The Teva that has always worked for me with no problems (that was being weaned out in 2019) was as follows..  peach color and sweet, easy to swallow and not gag on. Teva now, is orange. The sweet taste that made it bearable to take has changed completely. My focus, clarity, motivation, and concentration has been/is immensely effected by the new ingredient change. (I don't have it at all)  My overall mental health, has declined quickly. It has caused my mood to completely change, headaches are constant, and upset stomach. All of this, and they don't even work. I struggle everyday now. Less main ingredient and more fillers means more pills can be produced, which means more money in the manufacturer's pocket..... Mental health should be top priority, especially being consistent with and not changing the ingredients.	1	January 17, 2021	51
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	This month is the first time I received sandoz adderall ER and it doesn't seem to work very well for me. Mallinckrodt doesn't seem to work too well for me either. I think Teva seems to work the best for me; even better than the name brand for adderall.	6	January 17, 2021	2
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have suffered with ADHD since I was a young kid, I got diagnosed at the youngest age possible and I never got any help for it by my old doctor.  With my new doctor, he gave me Adderall XR to start out with 10 and than up it to 20 within a week if not effective.   I am on 20 MG now and it has changed my life, I failed school and life because I couldn't pay attention and now not only can I pay attention but this has also helped as my ADHD had caused Depression/Anxiety also OCD.	10	January 15, 2021	14
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Generic Adderall varies significantly depending on mfg. Reason being, the FDA says the mfg only has to “demonstrate” it “works in the same way “ as the brand-name. i.e. generic ingredients do  Not have to be same which is why so many don’t work and/or make people feel sick. My experience, the only generic that works like the brand-name is Prasco, which acquired Teva’s generic xr in 2016.  Few pharmacies use Prasco as their generic because it’s more expensive!  My Dr specifies “Prasco generic only” on my prescription for D-Amphetamine ER 30MG Salt combo. By law, the pharmacy must comply if Prasco is one of their overall suppliers. My insurance changed so I called Prasco to see if they sell to Costco. They do. Just takes a day or 2 for the pharmacist to order and fill my script. Walgreens used Prasco as their generic until recently. Now it’s Mallinckrodt which just filed for bankruptcy to settle a slew of opioid lawsuits. It’s all about $		January 8, 2021	60
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	The adderall name brand is 2-3 times better than generic adderall XR. The FDA should be inspecting these generic companies and make sure they are getting as high of quality ingredients. I urge anyone in generics to try real adderall for a month then decided for yourself. Decide to report the generics because we should be able to get a cheaper still 90$ for generic compared to $220+ for name brand.	10	January 7, 2021	18
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’m a doctor with ADHD. I’ve been on the generics to cut costs during tough times but I insist on the name brand adderall. No only is it smoother it lasts longer and helps even more than the generics. It’s a shame that cost is a bearing on necessary prescriptions and that generic are so much weaker and poorer quality. Generic adderall needs to step it up they have quality issues and their recipe is somehow flawed.	5	January 7, 2021	25
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I've only been taking it for 3 days but I can understand now when people say they feel it running in the background. So far no side effects other than appetite loss. I do feel energy from this but not like Adderall there's no anxiety tied to the energy its more like motivation than energy. One thing I've noticed is I like to always be doing something that is productive in some way. It's not the type of energy you get and use to dance or workout you feel driven to get things done.  It last for the whole 16 hours which surprised me I'm an ultra rapid metabolizer. I have no crash on this like I did with Adderall. I'm just waiting for my period now to see how the cramps are and giving the medicine more time to see if I do have any side effects, so far none but no appetite.	10	January 3, 2021	11
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I've been taking dextroamp-amphet ER 15mg once a day for roughly 3 months now and it's helped me greatly until 2 weeks ago and it's as if I cut my dose by 3/4! Is this normal and what dose, frequency, and type of adderall should I change to? I've heard about generic vs name brand, so what do the best ones look like?	6	December 30, 2020	1
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I've been prescribed adderall for 10yrs+ and without it mentally and physically I would be worse. I do have soreness, achy body, etc but have other health problems. Adderall has ROTTED MY TEETH OUT. Being 42 years old, fear ability to retain with out medicine as I age. I have severe withdrawal, to include extreme fatigue, severe constipation. I need the Adderral and helps some as without it life would be more difficult. All and all I would not manage without it very well but it is less effective as been taking for years. Take care and God Bless All. Be Safe!	7	December 24, 2020	10
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Regarding the post by DrKatz on 11/7/2020:.  I too take the 20 mg salt combo- manufactured by Teva, and have been on that specific brand for two and a half years.  I can definitely concur that something has changed with their product.   I am on a prescription of 80 mg a day and I too noticed a difference in taste, consistency of the pill itself, and it not working as well as it used to.  I am aware of a recall May 22nd by Teva for a few of their doses- the 20mg pill being one of them.   Thinking placebo, I inspected the pill closely: the depression level of the imprint is different, slight change in the oblong shape, the edging* (*like the cut/side profile of floor boards) and thickness + curvature.   The taste difference (bitter) I noticed in August. October back to normal but currently (Nov.) the taste changed again- however this time with a much greater chemical profile- like bactine or rubbing alcohol, more crumbly and not working as well for either my ADHD or narcolepsy.	8	November 15, 2020	29
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’ve been on Adderall XR 20 mg since October 6th 2020. I have to say this medication is life changing and your psychiatrist, doctor or whatever will try and find the right dosage for you. I’m 22 years old, Male and I noticed the medication working within an hour, I’m about 220 pounds 5’8 and despite that it still kicked in relatively fast. The side affects I notice the most are as follows dry mouth, appetite suppression, some irritability, and insomnia on occasion. Adderall XR for me last anywhere from 8-12 hours, if it wears off the medical professional in most cases will add Adderall IR to take in the afternoon, since upping the dose of XR will not increase duration only the intensity of the medication itself. ADHD medication is all about finding what’s right for YOU, don’t give up if it doesn’t get manageable or fixed after the first try.	9	November 8, 2020	42
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have always used Teva Adderall IR because I have had horrible experiences with other generic, including inconsistency and lack of potency.  Understand that I have taken Teva Adderall 20MG tablets over five years, thus it would less difficult for someone like me to detect subtle changes in its effects.  I have noticed the following, and this started around September 2020.  Teva generic Adderall tablets seem (and this is very subtle) smaller in size. Second: Teva is known for its slight sweet taste. It is almost as if that is completely  gone... I’m certainly not saying that added anything to it, but I’m saying it’s an indicator  of some sort of formula change.  Finally, although the 20MG tablet is small, it used to be easy to half the tablet. Recently they just crumble. To summarize, I have also noted a very marked decrease in efficacy.	7	November 7, 2020	26
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Adderall XR is Life changing (positively). I went from being massively distractable and procrastinate constantly to getting things done. I'm not just referring to school work or office work. I mean just showing up on time to meet up with friends. Not getting instantly bored with family.  I truly love it!   --- Quick warning, take it as your doctor recommends! So much of the bad press comes from people abusing the drug.  Likewise, if you're able, take a day off now and then. Perhaps on days when you don't need to work or do much. It's sort of like coffee/tea/caffeine in that sense. Fine if you do take it everyday, but probably best if you give your mind/body a rest from it now & then.  Just like running or exercise, you need light or rest days each week to really get the most from the workout.	10	November 6, 2020	34
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	My grades instantly went from the 60s and 70s to 90s and 100s and for once I felt like I had control over my life. The side effects were pretty bad and inconsistent though, so I had to go from 20 to 15 mg.	9	November 4, 2020	18
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	The Adderal dose my doctor prescribed didn't seem to work that great(20 mg twice a day)  One day I had it after my oatmeal and it was more effective so after that I just scrunched up the pill like I did with oatmeal, but I didn't put it on anything.  I just took it like that. Works great!  Much more motivation to get tasks done so I can finish more!  Maybe you could try that if it sees not enough to work.  I use Sandoz.	10	October 11, 2020	20
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Adderall XR was originally prescribed to me for ADD, but it worked best as a terrific antidepressant.  However, now that I've been on it for 20 straight years at 40-80 mg. Daily, it has very little antidepressant effect now. It's Adderall burnout -- apparently it strips the brain of dopamine -- the feel-good hormone.        I still have to take it just to do anything at all each day.  The worst effect is insomnia -- no matter how early I take it.  It keeps me up for 24 hours unless I finally have to take Seroquel for sleep.  Seroquel is the only thing that will knock out Adderall XR.  But I hate it because it makes me so damn sluggish in the morning, awful.        I cannot believe it's 2020, and there is still no decent antidep medication available,	8	October 1, 2020	31
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	The last 9 months generic “Zydus” was the only brand of amphetamine/dextroamphetamine available in my area. I noticed pretty nasty side effects beginning 45 minutes after consumption. I’ve never felt depression so severely before taking Zydus. Teva/Barr has returned. Felt a night and day difference the first day. Hope Zydus gets banned for the safety of us all.	1	September 23, 2020	20

ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I switched over to Mydayis in hope of finding something that could last the entire day. My days are usually nonstop for approx 16 hours. I started at the lowest dose and went up to the 50mg after 3 weeks. Gave it a few more weeks in hopes that it would work like how we wanted it to. The negative side effects outweigh the positives. The first thing I noticed was ejaculatory anhedonia. It led to an unplanned pregnancy before I caught it. The rest included falling behind in classes and not being able to keep up at work. Felt lazy and not wanting to do anything. It was like being unmedicated all over again!	4	September 21, 2020	8
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Generic Adderall:  TEVA vs. ALVOGEN “All generic adderall is NOT the same trust me!...... I don’t care what your physician or pharmacist may say.“  I’ve taken Adderall for nearly 25 plus years for ADD.  WHY? it works twice as good ask anyone whose taken different brands before. For the BEST quality and most potent adderall on the market is made by a company called TEVA.  Even pharmacist tell me when they run out of TEVA and must use ALVOGEN their patients complain because the pharmacies cannot keep TEVA in stock because the consumers know it’s the best and most effective for ADD and ADHD.	1	September 15, 2020	133
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have taken both Adderall and its generic(amphetamine/dextroamphetamine) for over 16 years for my Adult Attention Deficit Disorder. I have found that the original Adderall has the best effectiveness and in these last 4 tears Teva [still oval, peach/orange color] working the best for my A.D.D. Pills made by Mallinkrodt I only get by mistake, and still act like a placebo in May 2020. Dose: 20mg. X 2 daily.		August 25, 2020	24
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I do not like this formula. I have been on various generics for years and did not feel like this 10 mg did anything. Unfortunately, I've already filled this prescription and am stuck with this medication.	1	August 24, 2020	7
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been taking Adderall for most of my adult life and Walgreens always carried the generic version that worked best for me but recently they changed who they get it from now and the new amphetamine / dextroamphetamine from Lannett MFG SUCK!  They do not work at all - actually the worst next to the  YELLOW ROUND Mp 447's, PINK ROUND Cor 136's, or OCTAGON WHITE ONES.   The TEVA amphetamine/dextroamphetamine Peach Oval B 974's are the ones that work best for me and now I don' t know how to get them - Help..	10	June 16, 2020	94
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	My concern in taking generic Adderall IR for several years is the effect is has on my heart  When I take it, at the prescribed dose,  I most always have sinus tachycardia  (a heart rate above 100 beats per minute)  I also have noticed that it effects bladder emptying....and my urinary stream seems slower (and I am fairly young) and I am not usually able to completely empty my bladder.	6	June 10, 2020	26
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Since the shortage for about 3 months I've been taking generic Zydus 20mg. How do these drugs pass inspection? I think a couple pixie sticks would work better. I wonder if generic adderall from any manufacturer will ever get better. I think charging over $5.00 for this rubbish should be criminal.	1	June 7, 2020	40
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	This medication amphetamine/dextroamphetamine has made me feel VERY JITTERY and sick to my stomach! I take generic TEVA brand orange tab 30 mg. The pharmacy didn’t have any of the TEVA brand so they gave me generic U31 tablet - Aurolife Pharma, LLC brand. This is horrible! People take time off work to be seen by doctor, get put on meds for a reason, spend money for the appointment and meds, all the time you spend doing this & it can’t be returned back to Walmart to get my right medicine because “it’s against the law” supposedly! Even when I have the entire prescription (minus one) to give them back. Why make people feel like this when they do so much to try and make life easier being on their meds. I don’t have insurance so my doc visit is almost $100 & medicine is around $60 every month. My 7 year old daughters meds were switched as well. I’m scared to even give her medicine! How can Walmart just give you a different brand that you’ve never taken and not tell me before I leave it’s different!?	1	June 5, 2020	67
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I am a male in my thirties. Adderall is the third drug I tried to tread ADHD after doing trials on Vyvanse and Concerta. Vyvanse worked but did not last long enough and I had bad crashing (headache, exhaustion). Concerta did not work for me at all, made me lethargic and even more distracted.  Adderall at 20mg a day gives me energy to focus on work and my kids. It lasts me until sometime in the evening. I have trouble sleeping some nights on it, other than that the side effects are negligible.	8	May 3, 2020	43
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Activist Dextramp-amphet ER (30 mg.) [ generic for Adderall ]  is HORRIBLE. NOT effective. Causes nausea. HORRIBLE. I have taken this drug for over 3 years and I know what it is supposed to do.	1	April 30, 2020	40
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Adderall is very useful but recently I was ignorant and thought it would be okay to take a little extra at night to help clean my house. I took a bigger extra dose then I should have and a few hours later I felt pretty awful. I am very productive and more positive on the right dose of this med, so I recommend trying it or Desoxyn, because it is said to have fewer side effects like anxiety and panic and irritability post dose. Like all meds, Adderall is a blessing when dosed right and a curse when dosed incorrectly. I noticed that I paced around a bit when on it but I didn’t feel that anxious. It isn’t fun and enjoyable to take a big dose, don’t do it. God made everything to be used in moderation and it is much better for the whole society when we obey the wise instructions of our doctors and leaders. Be careful, obey your doctor, and may God bless you all to succeed in your treatment plans and in your lives. Amen	8	March 18, 2020	74

ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Recently changed pharmacies and didn't realize that there can be quite a difference between generics. For 4 years I’ve taken adderall 2x day, 10 mg. Never any problems until I switched pharmacies to save $.  Elite Pharma is who makes this new one and it is NOT GOOD.   I am lethargic, unable to focus, quite sleepy.  It’s as if I haven’t even taken anything.  Incredibly frustrating as I am not even half way through this months supply.	1	March 7, 2020	50
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	The generic manufacturer of amphetamine & dextroamphetamine, Sandoz, is the only one that works for me. This month the manufacturer is Northstar and last month Aurobindo, and they are garbage. They don’t help AT ALL with my focus. Zero.  I am irritable. I am getting nothing done and my anxiety is sky high. I am going to stop taking these brands and ask pharmacy for Sandoz.  I complained to the FDA and urge others to do so as well. This is ridiculous.	1	March 3, 2020	70
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Adderall has worked great for me when taken as needed. When I was in my early 20’s and taking it daily I built up a dependence that lead to terrible withdrawals as it is very addictive. (Learned the hard way and never want to go through that again!)  I will usually only take this when my ADHD symptoms are unbearable and my work/personal life starts to become affected. We are talking maybe 1-4 tablets max per month.  It really does help with focus and energy, and I find that one 10-20mg dose is usually enough and I feel good for several days after the dose without any withdrawals or dependence issues.

ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	If you're taking for ADHD please note there are a lot of side effects, having said this, they are sometimes serious so take note to talk to your doctor. If you get cold fingers or toes, make sure to consult your doctor as it's a syndrome that can be prevented.  It does help with focus, it helps with impulse control, it helps with a general overall euphoric feeling and it can cause you to lose a lot of weight. Be sure to eat, EAT, don't shake your head, you know I'm talking to you. Eat and stay hydrated it causes you to urinate a LOT, make sure to supplement what you are losing. It will cause tremors, shakes, and irritability, again, eat food. Make sure to stick to a 2000 calorie diet AT LEAST. May cause muscle fatigue and extreme soreness, stay hydrated, make sure of this.  Some say it causes better grades in school, well, to an extent. It just makes you write a lot. Eat Eat Hydrate And maybe take melatonin to help promote rest. I warned and entertained you.	7	February 21, 2020	97

ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I totally agree that the new A 79 generics are no good.  I mean they work a little bit, but I feel taking the same amount of the other oblong orange ones that taste like sweet we’re way better.  These taste like nasty chalk.

ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been on  adderal 15mg 2×daily  for 7 yrs it has completely change my life.  I  was always down, depressed, unmotivated, impulsive, always day dreaming, short attention span, no focus and couldn't sitting still. Adderal has given me a new happy life that I can enjoy and appreciate. Starting to think I need to go up to 20mg. I can feel I'm getting used to them. But without them I wouldn't get out of bed and would waste my life.I  think adderal is my miracle drug I have never been so grateful for a prescription drug	10	February 17, 2020	111
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I was diagnosed with ADHD combined type and have tried Ritalin and Focalin. Both weren't that great for me so my doctor prescribed me 10 mg of Adderall XR. Adderall has made me have better multitasking skills and helped me pay attention. It hasn't really helped with being hyper or being impulsive and has given me bad twitching eyes. It also has made my sleep schedule weird so watch out for that.	6	February 6, 2020	23
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Picked up amphetamine with dextroamphetamine medicine 1/24/20, bottle said Barr brand? But Teva tabs were inside. Teva bought Barr in 07. Before Teva bought out multiple companies and started using their ingredients within the last 2-3 years, they were great. Sandoz and Corepharma have been the only other decent makers, before they were bought out. I haven’t noticed a thing from picking these up 1/24. The worst medicine I’ve had from Teva in 8 years.	1	February 4, 2020	36
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	On 1/24/2020 I received Teva generic IR Adderall like I usually have for the last 7 years off and on (used to be good.) Except Barr was labeled on the bottle for the first time ever. Not sure why since Teva bought Barr in 07. Regardless it isn’t any better, by far the worst I’ve had of Teva. But every other company is pathetic. Brand works 10X better but 10X pricier. If the FDA enforced the rule of not less than 80% and no more than 125% concentrated effectiveness, that would be a first! The right MG of each dose might be regulated, but the fillers/inactive ingredients added is the big issue. 1-3 used to be in the old Barr/ Shire/ Sandoz/ Core and those worked fantastic. Every generic now has 5-8 fillers that make it less effective but also cause severe side effects. FDA could care less about small market drugs.	1	February 3, 2020	50
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Game changer. First DX by A pdoc: ADHD. What, no?  Yes.  I felt like I was only working with one puzzle piece and finding out about ADHD was like being given the other 999 pieces. At first Adderall IR didn’t seem to do much but I slowly realized it was like putting emotional and mental blinders on where I could see the rest of the world but mainly focus on the task at hand. Job saver for sure.  Since I have a high tolerance to meds XR saved me from constantly trying to remember to take next dose when I started crashing. Tops.	10	February 3, 2020	30
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have found the generic brand for Adderall is not effective as the brand name.

ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I went to pharmacy to pick up my Adderall generic brand Zydus. I was told they was out of my brand. I was given the Epic brand. The Epic brand caused me to have severe depression and I stayed in bed, I’ve always been very energetic. I stopped taking it. I called the Pharmacist and reported the side effects I had.

I switched to so many brands, but they say they are all alike, and say it doesn't matter which generic I get, because they're all the same.  My doctor, unfortunately, thinks the same.  I finally said to the pharmacy tech one day, ""I'm sure I'm not the only one, who would like certain generics."" She said, no, I'm the only one. I know this sounds crazy, but the blue 10mg of teva, don't seem to work like the 15mg of the peach teva, even if I cut one of the blue in half to make it 15mg."	8	January 23, 2020	92
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I was taking 15mg of generic Adderall  amphetamine / dextroamphetamine  for 3 months and by the end of the 3rd month I had 3 separate people tell me I didn't seem myself. I'm a regularly joyful and excited person but every emotion I had felt muted or stunted while on amphetamine/dextroamphetamine. I stopped talking it and 3 days later felt so much better. I was joyful again! Back to pinging all over the place but at least I'm happy doing it lol. I'm trying Concerta next.	4	January 21, 2020	3
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Ok so I have Both Narcolepsy/Extreme Fatigue & ADD. The generic forms of Adderall (amphetamine and dextroamphetamine) seem to be getting worse and worse. They are making them with obviously cheaper so-called similar ingredients but the new generic amphetamine and dextroamphetamine drugs just have bad side effects and don’t work for me at all or are far less effective. I don’t know if it is Teva brand that is making these cheap ineffective knock-offs that cause migraines & other side effects but they are definitely not working or decent. The generic form Amphetamine Salts works just fine for me but again I think when Teva took over and apparently used far cheaper Ingres there is definitely a disconnect because I don’t think Dextroamp-Amphetamin is a worthy generic form of Adderall but maybe just because Teva brand seems to be using incredibly cheap ingredients,	10	January 20, 2020	21

ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’ve been on adderall for a few years now and it was life changing. I’ve always been prescribed a generic and have never had a problem until recently. I noticed that I was not getting the same benefit as I was previously and for months, tried to convince myself that it was in my head and then one month, I noticed everyday that I felt great! Looked at the pill imprint and what do you know - it was a different manufacture (Amneal) than the one I was taking. I started googling it and saw a lot of complaints for generic Adderall from Global Pharmaceutical. I’m talking to pharmacist today about it and requesting the generic by Amneal Pharmaceuticals. I thought they were all the same and it’s a shame that global can make these any less effective than what they should be. Is it so people go to their dr, say they don’t feel the effects of it and get an increase? Sounds like a big pharma thing to do. Trust your gut instinct because you’re the person who knows you best.	1	January 8, 2020	17
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	"I recently was given this new form of adderall from the pharmacy which was circular with just an ""A"" on one side... I did not like this new form of Adderall at all!! I assumed it would have the same effect as the typical oval shaped and it was completely different which is a little scary. It was very bitter and gross tasting unlike the football shaped one has a sweet note. It also disintegrated turning to powder immediately, as I attempted to break it in half (waste of product). I did not get any focus from it nor did I feel any different at all?? It did nothing! Then the next day got a horrible headache! I was talking with a friend who also mentioned getting the same thing recently. He mentioned having an extremely bad headache too the following day, so we now know it's from this form of adderall. I DO NOT LIKE IT. It should be pulled from the market honestly I don't know what the heck this rubbish  is but it is not adderall."	2	January 2, 2020	79
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Was first diagnosed with ADD(inattentive type) by multiple doctors at 18 years old. Out of the gate they prescribed me 60mg IR amphetamine with dextroamphetamine. I am now 26, taking 80mg/day, and have learned a substantial amount about this drug. No it won't make you any smarter or develop hidden talents, most believe this. The generic (dextroamphetamine-amphetamine IR) is cheaper than its brand (Adderall xr.) Obviously brand is set to higher standards of quality than generics, so yes brand name anything works better than generics, it's common sense. If you use it correctly and find the right manufacturer like Teva, you most likely won't find as many negatives as most people.	8	December 30, 2019	9
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’ve been taking the generic version of Adderall for about 2 years now. I was tired all the time and couldn’t focus. I felt like a slug and when I had energy I still had brain fog, and had a hard time studying. In class, I would fidget in my chair, doodle, and listen to lectures, but nothing would stick in my head. No matter how long I studied.  I was prescribed the 7.5 mg tablet once a day and just the small dose did wonders for my energy levels and let me focus and actually get things done. It helped me talk in social situations and gave me a mood boost.  That being said, The generics changed a couple times. And I’m not sure, but I think I can tell a difference between them. After the pill wears off, my head aches, my legs throb, my body aches, and I’m nauseous and feel sick. I have flu like symptoms, which are miserable. It’s sad because it’s a really small dose and helps me so much but some of the side effects suck. You just gotta see what’s worth it to you.	8	December 24, 2019	61
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	This medication does not work at all now.	1	December 2, 2019	49
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Not very effective; I took a  double dose which cause headaches and made me generally feel ill.  There are  better generics. Company should not be allowed to sell this medication.	1	November 17, 2019	13
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been on Adderal 10 mg for three months now. I have found it helps me so much in the morning. I need to talk to my doctor and see if I can get something for the afternoon. It's been a godsend but I don't have any anger issues just a lot of anxiety. I'm on Xanax as well three times a day and Ambien for sleep which really helps bed by 5 clock I'm wore out. And then my symptoms seem to return. I would recommend this to anyone that has concentration issues. I'm 41 years old and when I went to school they always called you slow. Which always made you look bad. I think my doctor he's wonderful and I'm going to get my Xanax upped and see if I can get something for the afternoon due to that I work many hours a day and I have to be on my toes.	9	November 2, 2019	6
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I got diagnosed with ADHD at the beginning of this school year, being my senior year of high school. Since 8th grade, I've struggled in school, been incredibly impulsive, had very strange eating habits, over-thought everything, and could never contain my anger or anxiety. Once prescribed, my life has changed. My grades went up, and in 3 months I've lost almost 30 pounds (I am still in the normal BMI range). I can control myself. I finally believe in myself because of Adderall.	9	October 29, 2019	80
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Well been on and off Adderall or Ritalin since I was 5. I'm 62 now, and take 60mg XR morning and two 30mg IR in the afternoon. For me it's a Godsend. I can pay attention now,  I'm more sociable, I'm just.......me.	8	October 23, 2019	22
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’m 48 yo woman that was diagnosed with ADHD in elementary.  When I began (on holiday) taking it I’m extremely fatigue/zombie the first 3 days, I am not nearly as engaged with anyone/anything around me (I talk 97% less when I’m on Adderall) and it makes me feel less cognitive.  I feel like it dumbs me down.  After the 3rd day I start to feel better and those “tranquilizer effects” go away. Adderall is an emotional regulator for me. It works wonders for my impulsivity, racing thoughts, fidgeting, feeling overwhelmed, anger, anxiety, zoning out, and my mouth. Yes, my mouth has always been my biggest challenge and has caused me tremendous social/professional problems.  While in a perfect world I’d be on no medication, I have to recommend Adderall for anyone whose suffering from ADHD, because  it has changed my overall quality of life for the best.  Sparkle on beautiful people! 	9	October 23, 2019	81
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I was diagnosed with both bipolar and ADHD. After trying multiple combinations, we finally tried adderall on top of Wellbutrin, Lamictal, and Fluvoxamine for OCD. At first, the adderall did wonders. Completely made me enjoy life again. However, as my tolerance increased, the adderall crash was very intense. It resulted in a bipolar low almost everyday around the same time. I recently just switched to Stratetta and is my second day taking it. Anxious to see how this works.	9	October 22, 2019	29
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’ve been taking meds for ADHD/ADD close to 8 years now.  Tried Adderall at many dosages, types and amount of times per day over a period of many years.  My biggest issue. I forgot to take them.  Tried Vyvanse. It helped but I got nauseous, dizzy every day.  Tried Adderall again and forgot to take them.  One day my doctor mentioned Mydayis. I wouldn’t have to remember taking more than one in the AM.  After a week I could tell that it was helpful but wasn’t able to tell if a BIG difference.  I ran out due to scheduling once & my brain went into hyper drive. I hadn’t felt that chaotic for awhile.  WHILE talking to my doctor she legit wrote out the prescription, handed it to me. ‘go fill it NOW.’ Even had others asking how long I would be without it.  It was clear it helped at that point.  I don’t notice any side effects.  My results with Mydayis are pretty good. No worries of forgetting it, which was the major factor in my switch.	8	October 20, 2019	11
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I'm making this review one year after trying Mydayis for only a week. I switched to this drug from Adderall IR 20's BID to the 37mg capsule, you don't really think your buzzing, but you indeed are, and more so than with Adderall for the same dose. What prompted me to write this review was that I noticed someone else who reviewed this mentioned that they would be returning the bottle to the pharmacy because they didn't want insurance to think they were keeping it. This is an effect of the drug, I too, even though I bought it on the $5 coupon, did not want the pharmacy (who does not care) to think that I wanted to keep this drug so I returned the remaining 23 capsules to them. It works well, puts you in a different state of mind, and doesn't provide the sense well being of some other ADHD products offer, but it does work better than some generics. Perhaps give this a try if you're on generics that don't work. It is pretty strong, but doesn't feel like it. if that makes sense.	7	October 14, 2019	12
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I was on 10MG XR for 3 months and it worked amazingly. This is a very good medication if you have trouble functioning like a normal person, although be prepared for really dark thoughts if you decide to stop taking it. Withdrawal from this drug is no joke, it can make you want to die...but if you keep taking it or taper off slowly you should be fine.		October 12, 2019	22
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I was diagnosed with ADD in 2005 after experiencing horrible distractibility in class while at college and not being able to focus on a single thought in my head.  I was prescribed Adderall IR and I remember feeling like I had drunk 5 Red Bulls or something!  My heart was pounding and I had horrible anxiety the whole day.  I only took it one time.  I decided to get off it immediately.  Soon after, I was prescribed Strattera, which didn't do ANYTHING.  I've gone for about 13 years without actual ADD medications because I really hated the idea of stimulants.  That all changed when I realized my ADD was getting out of control.  I saw my current psychiatrist last week who re-diagnosed me and we discussed my experiences.  I had read reviews from people here who say that Dexedrine works for them if Adderall made them too wired, so I asked if I could try that.  I just tried it today and I had no horrible side effects - no anxiety, no heart palpitations, no edginess, etc.  It is wonderful!	1	October 9, 2019	21
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have suffered my entire life with ADD.  For a while Adderal helped. Then as I turned 49 it seemed to make me more anxious, irritable,  short tempered, and I had No patience for stupidity! Upon trying the Mydayis,  I was immediately impressed. I was finishing projects.  Getting things done right! Able to focus for longer durations of time. Long enough to complete tasks at hand. I feel so much better.	10	October 3, 2019	30
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I will never give this to my child again!, I know all children are different but I'm sticking with Dyanavel XR. While he was on Adderall he was acting angry and violent, like he was on some kind of illegal drug, his facial expressions were intense, and he could not sit still, and was very emotional. so I have to give this a 1 star on my personal experience and my son's	1	October 2, 2019	35
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I've had a prescription for amphetamine with dextroamphetamine for  four years, and Teva used to work fairly well for me. Over the last year or so, it's become awful. I know it isn't me, because I still have old (2-3 years) pills laying around; I tried some of them and they work just fine.   Teva changed something in the manufacturing process. The new pills do almost nothing beneficial (I feel sleepy all day), but they have a ton of side effects. I feel very jittery, my stomach hurts, and I've been experiencing bloating.	1	September 30, 2019	23
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Overall, 20 mg Adderall XR for ADHD helps me to focus. The problem with adderall is it makes me sweat something awful. Anyone else annoyed with sweating while taking adderall?	9	September 28, 2019	62
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Well first off. Adderall is an Amphetamine  which assist with the production of dopamine. Very close  relation to meth. I am 21 years old and I started Adderall again. Previously I was on Adderall from age 8-13 and it worked great. Some say ADHD is not real and it just a symptom of bad health etc... I have been very very healthy and unhealthy which produced no changed in brain fog. Now that engineering is my main task in like I seem to have a hefty amount of brain fog. Adderall does in fact help with focus but the downside is the extreme crashes that happen when you stop taking it.	8	September 26, 2019	20
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been on Adderall for quite sometime. It has helped me focus and also being proactive. I recently got a new script and diff manufacturing teva  I noticed since I have taken it I'm extremely tired. Cannot focus at all I feel like a scatter brain..I had to call my dr to have him rewrite a new script and surrender the Teva (amphetamine with dextroamphetamine) Did anyone get the same reaction?	1	September 26, 2019	20
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I shared my experience recently on here and was going back over and reading others as well.  I believe we should all state the laboratory that producing the specific generic we are each taking. Doing so may help us all narrow down which ones to stay away from and which ones are truly therapeutic.  Eon lab  brand of amphetamine/dextroamphetamine was good until 9 months ago, now they are horrible (no therapeutic value and bad side effects).  I then I switched to Teva and they were decent for about 2 months and now they are giving me side effects.  Plus the pharmacy ran out of them and I had to wait for a new batch and when the new batch came in is when the bad side effect started.  I KNOW the drug manufacturer has changed something.  Hope that helps someone.	2	September 24, 2019	122
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	So, I have had ADHD since I was like young. I never liked the pills they gave me when I was younger because I was already a thin kid and then taking Adderall I would eat even less. So I stopped taking the medication. When I was taking this medication I got most improved student! I went without the drug for years, until just about 2 years ago I started taking it again and It has helped me so much! I am very thankful for this drug. I suffer from fatigue , and many, many other problems. This drug is one of many I NEED, To Think Straight and to not get outta control.  It also helps me BIG TIME with my anger issues. Hope this helps someone! Star Kid Is OUT!	9	September 11, 2019	47
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	This drug is one of the greatest formulas of all time. I went from down and depressed and unmotivated to organized and focused. Also from relatively poor to rich due the effect it had on me with my enthusiasm for work	10	September 11, 2019	57
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I cannot believe that the FDA allows AUROBINDO or TEVA to sale their lousy drugs through pharmacies in the US.  Neither of these generics have any affect on me at all!!  WASTE of money!   They are playing with people's minds and well being!!!!	2	September 6, 2019	110
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Have taken Adderall on and off for around 13 years for ADD and CFS. I was lucky enough to have tried the “real” brand Adderall by Barr laboratories. I’ve never taken over 20mg a day. This medicine has gone to TRASH.The only negative side affect from the Barr version was occasional jaw clinching.   I think Teva must’ve burned the patent formula or something because it has never worked liked the Barr, not even close.  So many negative side effects (migraine headaches, heartburn, nausea)! I keep hoping at some point they might magically start producing a decent version that actually helps instead of hurts.  The original Barr had true therapeutic value.  Eon labs produced a decent generic for a while, but BAM, it suddenly went to garbage at the end of 2018.  So switched back to Teva a couple months back and it started ok( not as good as Eon but better than everything else out there), then last months refill is feeling like they’re changing to something bad too.  Bring back real Adderall!	3	September 4, 2019	78
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I had taken Adderall for many years and was slowly on the decline.  I was deeply depressed and had an absolute hopeless and helpless outlook on life with no relief. I had psychosis, delusions and impulsive behavior which I never had. I began having issues with memory, thinking, reasoning, decision making, tasks, and  concentration.  I would become very agitated if being interrupted. I was very aggressive and agitated constantly, it was at least 98% of the time in 10 years.  I read horror stories about stimulants, namely the Amphetamine line of them. I subsequently tapered off of them and feel 100% better than before. I have no depressive symptoms, delusions, memory problems, agitation or aggressiveness. I was not happy with life and my personal relationships were very toxic. I wasted almost 10 years of my life feeling like this and have other personal complications that resulted from the use of these toxic drugs.	1	August 28, 2019	29
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I'm all shook up. But it works!	9	August 26, 2019	20
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Works well for my adult ADHD. It gets me motivated, and I can feel it kicking in. The perfect dosage for me is the 15mg tablet, morning, and another 15mg after lunchtime! I score the 30mg tablet in half.	9	August 22, 2019	6
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I've had ADHD since I was a kid and after a couple of years taking Ritalin I stopped and then tried it again once in my 20's and again in my 30's but never liked the way it made me feel. Starting in my late 30's I started to suffer from chronic fatigue syndrome which doesn't mix well with ADHD. It puts the body and mind in a bad place. I finally got around to going to the doctor and he recommended that I take Adderall 3 times a day. This has been such a benefit to my life. Not only do I have the energy to get out of bed I can now focus enough to get some daily life stuff done.	10	August 13, 2019	9
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	First prescribed it in grad school for ADD & depression. Worked wonders. Only downside is I became very reliant on it. Was stuck between the two evils of being a depressed zombie (w/o taking it) and feeling like a happy, motivated, focused person (on Adderall). Eventually stopped taking and failed out of grad school. Work was hard, always late, made stupid mistakes, & couldn’t complete tasks. 3 years & 3 jobs later, I broke down and went back to a doctor who rediagnosed me with ADD, Anxiety, & Depression. I was reluctant to start back on Adderall and tried a few alternatives first. Everything made me feel even MORE exhausted; back on Adderall 30mg day; feel normal again. I have the motivation, energy, & focus to complete tasks. Only complaint is anxiety which I resolve w/ a low benzo & exercise. Remember, there’s no reason to be miserable if there’s a pill out there that can change your life.	7	August 10, 2019	103
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	"I've finally found it. - Mydayis it is that little reminder I never had; the missing piece of my conscience that was never there before to tell me ""stop mucking and go do the stuff you should be getting on with"""	7	August 5, 2019	31
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	This medicine initially seemed to work very well for me with improved concentration but after taking it for only 6 months I discontinued it due to anxiety levels being through the roof to the point where I couldn’t function. This was enhanced during social interactions of which is ironic because I know many people say they experience increased desire for social activities. A month after stopping medicine, I started experience psychotic symptoms of which have not subsided. I do not suggest this medicine.	4	August 3, 2019	18
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I'm 19. I've tryed a lot of ADHD medication (I'm from Canada so I have less option than the US). Concerta, Biphentin, Vyvanse. With all these medication I've experienced sides effects, or, in the case of Vyvanse, I was not focused enough. And now I'm on Adderall XR and I can tell you than is the best ADHD medication I've tried. I feel like I can multi-task like Vyvanse but more focus, and this focus make all the difference. I don't feel a lot of sides effects, and they are nothing if I compare with Concerta or Biphentin. and Adderall XR is one of the only ADHD medication with generic availability in Canada!	9	August 2, 2019	23
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Adderall X R 30mg in the morning along with 5mg of Adderall in the early afternoon seem to help my mood and condition dramatically. If you are ADHD I recommend talking with your psychiatrist.	10	August 2, 2019	24
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Started off with  Adderall  5 mg IR twice daily.  Overall, this is a very low dose.  I have found it was more effective and safer to take it every couple of days.  At least for me.  I have tried 40mg and 60mg before so I am very aware of how intense it can be.  If you take it every day you will end up increasing the dosage.  Try to use it sparingly and try doing activities that produce dopamine naturally like exercise or walking and listening to music.  This will help you feel healthier while taking it.  Overall I think it is helpful but definitely feels unnatural and can't believe they give speed to children.  	5	July 30, 2019	35
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I asked my doctor about Mydayis because it lasts 16 hours.    The first week I was so calm, never been so calm in my life, even with antidepressants. I was able to focus during conversations. I organized my desk (a little). Cleaned my car out (a little). My second week i was still focusing but I couldn't eat. I was repulsed by anything other than fruits, vegetables, cereal. But then I felt dizzy...sick to my stomach. My eyes seem to move involuntarily   Nystagmus )mand I got the worst eye strain I've ever had. My neck muscles felt extremely tight and I just kept massaging my neck trying not to panic. I tried to tough it out for the next 2 days but could not. It's been day 2 days since I quit taking it and my eyes are still involuntarily moving a little. I had big hopes for this med but this is how it worked it for me and I was only taking 12.5 mg.  I just needed to let everyone know about this possibility because I couldn't find any info about it. It would probably be considered a tic.	3	July 27, 2019	28
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Diagnosed ADD 18 y/o, on and off Adderall IR since then. Too high a dose causes psychosis...be forewarned. I used to be on 30mg 3x/day, now I'm leary of taking more than 2.5mg 2x/day. Maybe it builds up in the brain, so be sure to take breaks from it often. I notice the side effects outweigh the benefits at higher doses....irritability, zombie-like come-down. My insurance only covers this and Ritalin, so I'm stuck with bad side-effects.	4	July 23, 2019	19
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	"Adderall is literally the only THING Period that I have tried that has improved my life in the slightest (I have ADD/Treatment-Resistant Depression ) - I got my Bachelors degree in Health & Psychology, I tried EVERY supplement herb, nootropic, etc. I'm commenting here is because of all the people saying how it drained them, or over time began making them feel worse - you need to educate yourself - one of the most important being, be SURE to be supplementing with TYROSINE, literally daily (tyrosine converts into Dopamine - like how 5-HTP converts to Serotonin) just like how SSRI's eventually ""poop out"" and just stop working (because they've used up the bodies natural serotonin) Adderall will eventually ""poop out"" on you, stop working, yet even worse when this happens, the more you take the WORSE you feel because its like revving an engine with no gasoline left in it!!! Theres plenty more to look into but even just taking Tyrosine makes a HUGE difference!"	8	July 19, 2019	97
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Adderall is all fun and games until you become addicted and try to stop taking it. I loved and still love Adderall, just like all of the positive reviews here - it works like nothing else, but I will never take it again.  I quit Adderall June of 2018 and it was the worst thing I ever went through - everything you read online about stimulant withdrawal is true x100. It’s almost impossible to successfully wean off of this medication. I went cold turkey 3x before I was finally successful.  It took me months to feel “normal” again.  During this time my life went downhill and I started up again December 2018 at a low dose, which before I knew it increased back to me 40mg dose.  I just quit Adderall again because I will be trying to get pregnant at the end of this year and it was once again a battle but I managed to do it. I will NEVER go back on this medication. Ever. It took me 2 hard lessons to realize how bad this medication is for you and your brain.	1	July 17, 2019	3
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I do not recommend anyone taking Adderall. I was unable to eat or sleep while taking this medication. It caused severe stunting of my growth.	1	July 17, 2019	8
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	"I have always known that I had ADD. However, I was in grad school, and I was studying for up to 10-12 hours a day. I found myself reading and re-reading and was having a hard time retaining information, because I couldn't stay focused. I would study for hours. Long story short, for my master's degree, I had to take practice timed test for NP boards, I failed it. My instructor told me to get tested for ADHD,  and get on medications. I did, and it was the best thing I have ever done, and wish I did it sooner, it cut my studying by half, because I'm very focused. I didn't have to request extra time for my NP boards, and I passed with time to spare. I have no side effects; incr. HR, BP, I eat and exercise, and don't take it late in afternoon to avoid insomnia. I only take it when I study and not everyday.  I believe it's about making the drug work for you and not let the drug control you.  Medication ""holidays"" are great to do."	10	July 13, 2019	36
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	If it wasn’t for Adderall I would be a basket case no questions asked. I'm 55 been on it since 2014 on an everyday basis. I'll take a day off every so often, but it's a rare occasion. My Blood Pressure is 122/74- pulse 64 when moving around normally. Resting my BP is lower along with the pulse rate. If you are relatively healthy heart wise no problems. I know one guy who's pushing 76 years old and he's still taking his prescribed dosage.	10	July 8, 2019	35
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	My son developed tics and we stopped the Adderall medication. Tics remain and one day he hit his head until no hair was there. He also now has blood in his stool no one can explain. Hmmm well permanent  damage isn’t worth the education we are providing now. I would rather buy a franchise than a college degree.	1	July 7, 2019	5
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been taking ADHD Medications for years. I have found that the Generic  Adderall ( Extended Release 20 mg) by Amneal Pharmaceuticals LLC. (CAPSULES STAMPED g454) ARE NOT as effective as other brands	2	July 2, 2019	7
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I've been on and off Adderall IR for the last year. When I'm on Adderall the first 3 months is amazing! I feel highly attentive and motivated. I have to take sleep meds because I'm so wired. The negative is the crash I feel by 6pm. It's like I transform into Angry Smurf - no longer talkative or cheerful and forgot about sex -- my libido shut down. My greatest battle is with food.  I am constantly hungry and when I eat the meds seem to lose its potency therefore causing me to skip meals. I built a tolerance rather quickly on this stuff and it lost its efficacy. IN ANY CASE, DO NOT INCREASE YOUR DOSAGES. Instead take a break from Adderall and try another drug for a couple of months.  This drug is not meant for long term use. Just few month. anything longer is just going to create a monster out of you.	6	July 1, 2019	17
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been taking 50mg of Mydayis for a few months now and I have been happy with my experience on this medicine. I have been on several regimens, including Vyvanse 70 + Dexedrine 10 booster, Adderall XR + Dexedrine 10 booster, Adderall xr + adderall 10 booster, Focalin XR, etc but I decided to give Mydayis a go since my new insurance has it covered on its formulary ($50 a month copay). Like others have said this drug runs in the background but I find it much more consistent and wayyyy longer acting than Adderall XR and even longer than Vyvanse, which only lasted 6 hours max for me. I take it at 5:30am and feel the medicine until about 5pm (~10 hours give or take). Mydayis less anxiety-provoking but I still feel like my ADHD symptoms are controlled around the clock and yet at the same time I feel more like myself than I did strung out on the other medicines. If you’re looking for an option that lasts a long while and your insurance will help pay for it I, think it’s a good option.	10	May 1, 2021	0
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have received my second refill of generic Adderall XR 20 mg made by Mallinckrodt and I am extremely unhappy with it. It is not at all effective. I have been on the non-generic Adderall XR for years without issue.	1	April 29, 2021	1
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have taken Adderall XR and short acting for 25 years and I got this new XR 30MG the other day Lannett and it made me tired, heart racing, BP accelerated and did NOTHING to help me focus. I contacted the pharmacy and my Dr and he's trying to switch me to another brand because this is a joke. awful..	1	April 26, 2021	6
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Just started taking adderall XR 10mg after learning I had been mis-diagnosed for 15+ years as either bi-polar, major depressive disorder and social anxiety. I finally found a psychiatrist that really dug deep and concluded I was not bi polar but I suffered from adult ADHD (33 year old male). It makes total sense as I read more about ADHD. I had been on every possible anti-depressant, anti psychotic MDD etc and was just done with meds. I was diagnosed as a child and teen but thought “ I’d grow out of it” and apparently never did it just got worse. I feel that so many people are mis-diagnosed it’s almost unbelievable. My theory and the doctor also said that if you take the medication and it calms you and your racing thoughts that that’s a tell tail sign that you do indeed suffer from ADHD, it’s not just a childhood/school era problem, it disrupts your life, marriage everything. I’m on day 2 and it’s like a light switch has been turned on and I can relax and not be manic.	9	April 25, 2021	4
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been on and off generic Adderall for many years. Currently, I have been prescribed 30 mg twice a day. For the last couple of months, it's been a nightmare. It's been on backorder and then changed the generic name from amphetamine salts combo to amphetamine/ dextroamphetamine combo. This is only because I have had severe headaches, extreme fatigue, and a loss of motivation. My ADHD has been out of the roof. It's frustrating because I feel like I did before taking any generic Adderall. I have even been concerned that maybe I was receiving a placebo rather than the actual medication. That's probably far-fetched, but it's been such a decline for me. There is something missing from this generic form and it is the essential thing that is needed to control my ADHD. I have even gained a lot of weight over the past two months. Hopefully, something will give, I can't imagine it affecting people like this and nothing changing.	3	April 19, 2021	8
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	This pill does not work like any Adderall that I have experienced. There is neither the focus or the energy bump that is typically associated with the two most therapeutic aspects of the formulation. The vast majority of time I feel equally as sleepy and unfocused as I did when I took it.    I am an experienced user of this positive life-changing medication. The patients that us this medication are in a bad position when company’s that make inferior generic medications are allowed distribution rights through equally as corrupt retail pharmaceutical outlets seeking to make a few pennies extra per script, on the back of patients whose experienced opinion is rarely considered.	2	April 17, 2021	2
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have taken ADHD meds many years. Adderall XR is the ADHD med that works the best for me. I am taking a generic manufactured by Lannett. It by far has worked the best for me with the reason(s) being is the smoothness, the come up is very quick, and it does it's job perfectly.   To reiterate, Lannett is very smooth with a quick come up, and last long enough most days.	9	April 15, 2021	4
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	If anyone else is having a terrible time with the new Lannett generic adderall you can report this to the FDA.  I have been having crippling headaches, stomach aches, and the medication doesn’t even feel like it works!!! I get tired after I take it and then can’t sleep all night because of it. HORRIBLE. Google fda medwatch online reporting to fill in the form	1	April 9, 2021	37
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Right now I take 50mg Lamictal for my Bipolar and 7.5mg twice a day Adderall for ADHD. At first I wasn't sure Adderall was going to work for me, I was initially prescribed 20mg twice a day.  That dose ended up being way too high for me, It made be become manic and I felt really wired all the time.  I now take 7.5mg twice a day and have found it to be much better. I feel alert and focused throughout the day.  Some of the side effects I have had are weight loss, jaw clenching, and mild insomnia (I usually just take melatonin). Overall, Adderall has helped me a lot, I just had to find the right dosage.	8	April 8, 2021	0
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been on Adderall for several years and the Sandoz brand is TOXIC and HORRIBLE! At first it is like a sugar pill no effect and then dizziness, headache, feeling more confused, spaced out and mind blank, extreme fatigue. I can't believe this is on the market. FDA honestly needs to step up their game and monitor the generics. It is a up and down roller coaster with different manufactures each month. This is insane. They are robbing us blind in the pharmaceutical business. They give us something toxic or a placebo. What is happening to the medications now. Please do not take the Sandoz. Read the court documents about reviews on them and they came from the company. Making themselves sound great as a pretend customer!! I can not believe how bad this medication from this manufacture is.	1	April 6, 2021	10
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Worked really well for the first week or so, but then really made me more irritable and gave me uncontrollable suicidal urges that ultimately sent me to the hospital. The suicidal urges stopped after dropping the medication.  I wouldn't recommend against the medication, I would just proceed with caution as the side effects can vary in intensity from person to person.	1	April 3, 2021	3
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been prescribed Amphetamine Salt Combo which has worked well(I have ADD and narcolepsy). Today I was given from RX, Amphetamine Aspertate, it make me fell kinda sickness. Was I given the wrong medicine. The prescription has not changed ?	7	April 1, 2021	3
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’ve been on Adderrall immediate release for at least 8 years, probably more. At first Adderrall gave me an intense high and made me very talkative. Very talkative. That lasted for a few days and after that each morning when I took it it gave me a euphoric feeling for about have the day. I wasn’t making impulsive decisions like I had in the past and my focus was razor sharp. I really enjoyed this drug for sometime but the last 3-5 years it’s just been the same old same old. I take it in the morning and have somewhat of a boost in energy and focus but after around 11am the effects of the medication just wears off. I wind up feeling irritable, decent level of focus if I’m busy at work, and just downright not very social with people. This week I’m going to see my P.A. and hopefully get on Vyvanse which I was encouraged by many to try before jumping on Adderrall. Vyvanse is more expensive but I’m ready to feel more focused and more myself.	5	March 28, 2021	4
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	This review is for generic Adderall XR - amphetamine/dextroamphetamine. I've experienced wildly different effects from different manufacturers. Some days it didn't work. Some days it worked great. But I got severe debilitating headaches that lasted 24/7 and didn't go away using ibuprofen. Went to neurologist and got an MRI. If I could push past the side effects it did work well but for only about 4-5 hours after kicking in (which took about an hour). Needed a booster of IR in the afternoon, so eventually I couldn't deal with the headaches and switched to IR completely. Headaches gone almost immediately. I still get them with IR but not anywhere near as often or as bad.	6	March 23, 2021	1
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	"I've tried several ADHD meds and Mydayis has definitely been the best for me. I'm on the lowest dose and it starts working 20-30 minutes after I take it. I'm then able to be productive and direct my focus easily, compared to other meds (eg-Adderall) which gave me a burst of intense focus that I had no control over. The transitions are barely noticeable and it really helps maintain consistent energy levels. After wearing off, it's a very natural ""I've worked all day and now I'm ready to relax before bed"" feeling (no crash). I also noticed it significantly helps manage my depression-something no other ADHD med has done. The only downsides: (1) it does reduce my appetite a lot and (2) it only lasts about 9-10 hours on my current dose (12.5mg), but higher doses (25mg+) give me headaches. It's not perfect, but the positives definitely outweigh the negatives for me. Lastly-you don't know how it'll affect you, so don't let reviews scare you away if you/your doc think it might help."	9	March 21, 2021	4
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I was diagnosed with ADHD at age 17 and only really started taking stimulant medication after I had turned 20 last year. I was originally trying out varying doses of IR but started trying XR in the past few months.  Overall: Hit or miss for me. It does help with my focus, but the side effects and how much it helps varies pretty drastically depending on the day. Biggest side effects are dehydration, lack of appetite, potentially crashing at night (normal). I also feel a bit uncomfortable sometimes (anxiety-ish twitchy feeling) but that's not very common.  The mallinckrodt brand I was switched to recently seems maybe a bit more hit or miss honestly I can't really tell that much of a difference (unlike people on opioids who swear that mallinckrodt is awful). I'm on 25mg for now and I'm gonna keep seeing how I feel in the coming weeks. Helps with ADHD no doubt, but do be weary of the side effects.	7	March 16, 2021	2
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I took Mydayis 37.5 mg for 2 years. I just recently ran out and decided to wait a week to refill. I cannot believe the change in myself! While on it I became withdrawn and too focused on 1 specific thing. I cut out people and ruined my small business. I didn't feel human! I can't explain the feeling but now that I haven't taken it in a week I feel like myself again! I was just flesh living day by day on mydayis! I will NEVER touch it again! Please tell me there's others out there with similar experiences	1	March 12, 2021	5
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	"I have been taking teva 20mg adderall from 06-19 when they disappeared. I had already suffered from side effects from other generics due to CVS giving me a different generic a few times without consent or being informed. I did the whole google wormhole for a few months before finally seeing a random comment about ""INACTIVE"" ingredients and how this person suffered terrible side effects across multiple generic medications with this same ""INACTIVE"" ingredient. Being on multiple meds myself and having autoimmune and neuro disorders it affected my mental health knowing something wasn't right and just not grasping why & not understanding. That random comment changed everything for me ""INACTIVE"" does not equal no effect.  Teva not being an option then and now not at all I use Mallinckrodt and Arubindo 20 mg. I find it helps to switch them every couple months or I take M in the morning and A in the afternoon depending on how my body is functioning. I tried SAndoz that was terrible side effects."	8	March 6, 2021	2
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	My 7 year old son is a first grader and was recently diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. He has been recommended Adderall for this but I am a bit reluctant to initiate its usage. I have a few reservations about how long it lasts in our system which I have heard can prove to be dangerous for a young kid. I have read multiple articles like these, but I am still not so sure. Seeing the number of experienced people here, please tell me if I should continue with it.		March 4, 2021	4
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	First time taking Alvogen generic amphetamine with dextroamphetamine 30mg. Been taking adderall for 2 years but always Teva generic. Oh my God, the Alvogen brand has made me feel so sick. All over severe headache, nauseous, vomiting, diarrhea. I feel awful. No focus, no energy, can't keep anything down, running to the bathroom.	1	February 27, 2021	8
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Been taking adderall for years. Until the had me try a white stop sign shaped one by mallinckrodt since there was an adderall shortage at my Walgreens. mallinckrodt amphetamine/dextroamphetamine shouldn’t even be labeled as amphetamine/dextroamphetamine it should just be sold as a caffeine pill because all it does is wake you up subtlety. It doesn’t help with focus whatsoever. I’ve already filed a complaint with the FDA and recommend everyone else do the same	1	February 25, 2021	20
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I take the 10 mg amphetamine with dextroamphetamine by Teva and it works great, better than the 15 mg.in my opinion. I see others mentioning generics by Alogen and Mallinckrodt here. Well I take a couple of other medications manufactured by these 2, on and off, most times it's Mallickrodt. Let me tell you, this is the WORST drug manufacturer on the market. The Alogen is junk too. I've been on a few medical chat sites just to see what I can find out about Mallinckrodt and see if others felt the same way and they absolutely do! Literally 100's of people have complained to the co. itself and to the FDA. This has been going on for a solid 5 years at least & the stuff is STILL pure unadulterated JUNK.	7	February 21, 2021	25
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Switched from Concerta to Mydayis for the longer duration mechanism Mydayis offers. Was started on 25mg of Mydayis. ADD symptoms improved but I experienced dry mouth, dizziness, heart increase, and appetite decrease which subsided after the first week. Second week I felt like the dose was not effective. Doc switched me to 37.5mg of the mydayis and so far symptoms of ADD improved but side effects are rough. Dry mouth, headache, dizziness, lack of appetite, increased anxiety. I’m on day 4 or 5 so hoping the side effects subside when my body adjusts to the higher dose... fingers crossed.	6	February 20, 2021	4
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I am currently on Adderall XR 30MG, and it has changed so many different aspects of my life, including depression.  I was prescribed Adderall because I was about to be terminated from my job. Back to the drug, I take it around 6am everyday, and found that my overall mood has changed. I am not as emotional as I was before, yet I am still able to express my feelings when necessary without the full breakdowns. I have been dealing with Major Depressive Disorder, and this medication has alleviated most of those feelings.  However, the medication has not been a miracle drug, and it contains no magic! For me, ADD has always been there. For me, it took me to be 36 years old to finally realize it was time to visit a psychiatrist, regardless of all the negative stigmas; I was glad I did, because it gave me many suspected answers, rather than self diagnosing situations.	9	February 15, 2021	17
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’ve taken adderall for years. I used to be on Lannett brand and Walgreens recently switched to TEVA. I had my script switched from CVS to Walgreens because it was closer to me. I have been on it for 3 months and the side effects are TERRIBLE.  I clench my teeth so bad my teeth have broken, I am severely depressed, I can’t find happiness in literally anything. I don’t feel motivated at all. If anything I feel less motivated to get out of bed. My skin is dry, my eyes are sinking in and I get terrible migraines. My anxiety is so bad I’m anti social, and I thought I had a stroke because of side effects. I’m 25. Just don’t take it		February 13, 2021	7
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I take two 30 mg pills a day for ADHD and it has really made a huge difference in my life. I am able to focus on one task at a time and complete it. Works great for giving me the motivation I sometimes lack. Only issue is that when I was given the white or peach ones, they did not seem to work as well as the pink ones. Talked to doctor about it and she added to my prescription to only receive the pink ones. Curious if anyone else has had this issue	9	February 10, 2021	37
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	ALVOGEN INC has got me all messed up. I've taken ADHD meds since 1st grade and I'm 32 now so I'm very confident in my ability to distinguish between generics that work & don't and why. For the past 4 years I've used the same CVS location to fill my Adderall tab 30mg generic the past two times though I received a pill that looked different thinking okay whatever this happens from time to time it is just a different manufacturer no big deal. I was wrong. I have had insanely high blood pressure increases, trouble sleeping, hardly any focus, SEVERE anxiety like where is feel like I can't breathe suddenly especially when I try to sleep, shaky hands, VERY noticeable heart palpitations, diarrhea, headaches and  weird emotional ups & downs. I've been vegan for 3 months now at first I was seeing a steady decrease in blood pressure but as soon as I started taking this new generic I'm topping out at 161/111 at the doctor a few days ago which is just absolutely bonkers and terrifying	2	February 9, 2021	9
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’ve taken TEVA adderall 20 mg IR for the past 2+ years. It worked greatly for my ADD & as an anti-depressant. HOWEVER, it has changed! Starting July 2020, the TEVA tablet was completely different. It was no longer sweet, the consistency was harder & the efficacy was compromised. I can take it & fall asleep hours later & there is ZERO anti-depressant effect. In fact, it deepens my depression.  I will submit a report to the FDA & I encourage everyone else to. Also, please research the complaints of TEVAs other generics. I’m not sure what to try next. I tried the Sandoz and it was actually worse. I received the hideous Zydus once-which gave me a migraine & intensely aching back.I believe it’s manufactured out of this country.  This experience has made me question ALL generic medications.   Please start researching yours & refuse to take these.  I tried switching to name brands but my ins. refuses to pay.	2	February 8, 2021	11
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Have used a generic for about 6 years now worked for me except it has turned me into a teeth grinder I do it all the time and now my teeth are worn to the point they are ruined.  My doctor said he never heard of that side effect but a recent visit to a dentist to try to fix my teeth I was told they see this all the time and this grinding may never go away.

ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’ve been in this medication for almost a year . And it change my life in good way.

ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been taking Teva amphetamine/dextroamphetamine (adderall generic) for quite sometime for ADHD. In the last year, I noticed right away something was off. First was the obvious color. The Teva that has always worked for me with no problems (that was being weaned out in 2019) was as follows..  peach color and sweet, easy to swallow and not gag on. Teva now, is orange. The sweet taste that made it bearable to take has changed completely. My focus, clarity, motivation, and concentration has been/is immensely effected by the new ingredient change. (I don't have it at all)  My overall mental health, has declined quickly. It has caused my mood to completely change, headaches are constant, and upset stomach. All of this, and they don't even work. I struggle everyday now. Less main ingredient and more fillers means more pills can be produced, which means more money in the manufacturer's pocket..... Mental health should be top priority, especially being consistent with and not changing the ingredients.	1	January 17, 2021	51
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	This month is the first time I received sandoz adderall ER and it doesn't seem to work very well for me. Mallinckrodt doesn't seem to work too well for me either. I think Teva seems to work the best for me; even better than the name brand for adderall.	6	January 17, 2021	2
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have suffered with ADHD since I was a young kid, I got diagnosed at the youngest age possible and I never got any help for it by my old doctor.  With my new doctor, he gave me Adderall XR to start out with 10 and than up it to 20 within a week if not effective.   I am on 20 MG now and it has changed my life, I failed school and life because I couldn't pay attention and now not only can I pay attention but this has also helped as my ADHD had caused Depression/Anxiety also OCD.	10	January 15, 2021	14
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Generic Adderall varies significantly depending on mfg. Reason being, the FDA says the mfg only has to “demonstrate” it “works in the same way “ as the brand-name. i.e. generic ingredients do  Not have to be same which is why so many don’t work and/or make people feel sick. My experience, the only generic that works like the brand-name is Prasco, which acquired Teva’s generic xr in 2016.  Few pharmacies use Prasco as their generic because it’s more expensive!  My Dr specifies “Prasco generic only” on my prescription for D-Amphetamine ER 30MG Salt combo. By law, the pharmacy must comply if Prasco is one of their overall suppliers. My insurance changed so I called Prasco to see if they sell to Costco. They do. Just takes a day or 2 for the pharmacist to order and fill my script. Walgreens used Prasco as their generic until recently. Now it’s Mallinckrodt which just filed for bankruptcy to settle a slew of opioid lawsuits. It’s all about $		January 8, 2021	60
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	The adderall name brand is 2-3 times better than generic adderall XR. The FDA should be inspecting these generic companies and make sure they are getting as high of quality ingredients. I urge anyone in generics to try real adderall for a month then decided for yourself. Decide to report the generics because we should be able to get a cheaper still 90$ for generic compared to $220+ for name brand.	10	January 7, 2021	18
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’m a doctor with ADHD. I’ve been on the generics to cut costs during tough times but I insist on the name brand adderall. No only is it smoother it lasts longer and helps even more than the generics. It’s a shame that cost is a bearing on necessary prescriptions and that generic are so much weaker and poorer quality. Generic adderall needs to step it up they have quality issues and their recipe is somehow flawed.	5	January 7, 2021	25
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I've only been taking it for 3 days but I can understand now when people say they feel it running in the background. So far no side effects other than appetite loss. I do feel energy from this but not like Adderall there's no anxiety tied to the energy its more like motivation than energy. One thing I've noticed is I like to always be doing something that is productive in some way. It's not the type of energy you get and use to dance or workout you feel driven to get things done.  It last for the whole 16 hours which surprised me I'm an ultra rapid metabolizer. I have no crash on this like I did with Adderall. I'm just waiting for my period now to see how the cramps are and giving the medicine more time to see if I do have any side effects, so far none but no appetite.	10	January 3, 2021	11
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I've been taking dextroamp-amphet ER 15mg once a day for roughly 3 months now and it's helped me greatly until 2 weeks ago and it's as if I cut my dose by 3/4! Is this normal and what dose, frequency, and type of adderall should I change to? I've heard about generic vs name brand, so what do the best ones look like?	6	December 30, 2020	1
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I've been prescribed adderall for 10yrs+ and without it mentally and physically I would be worse. I do have soreness, achy body, etc but have other health problems. Adderall has ROTTED MY TEETH OUT. Being 42 years old, fear ability to retain with out medicine as I age. I have severe withdrawal, to include extreme fatigue, severe constipation. I need the Adderral and helps some as without it life would be more difficult. All and all I would not manage without it very well but it is less effective as been taking for years. Take care and God Bless All. Be Safe!	7	December 24, 2020	10
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Regarding the post by DrKatz on 11/7/2020:.  I too take the 20 mg salt combo- manufactured by Teva, and have been on that specific brand for two and a half years.  I can definitely concur that something has changed with their product.   I am on a prescription of 80 mg a day and I too noticed a difference in taste, consistency of the pill itself, and it not working as well as it used to.  I am aware of a recall May 22nd by Teva for a few of their doses- the 20mg pill being one of them.   Thinking placebo, I inspected the pill closely: the depression level of the imprint is different, slight change in the oblong shape, the edging* (*like the cut/side profile of floor boards) and thickness + curvature.   The taste difference (bitter) I noticed in August. October back to normal but currently (Nov.) the taste changed again- however this time with a much greater chemical profile- like bactine or rubbing alcohol, more crumbly and not working as well for either my ADHD or narcolepsy.	8	November 15, 2020	29
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’ve been on Adderall XR 20 mg since October 6th 2020. I have to say this medication is life changing and your psychiatrist, doctor or whatever will try and find the right dosage for you. I’m 22 years old, Male and I noticed the medication working within an hour, I’m about 220 pounds 5’8 and despite that it still kicked in relatively fast. The side affects I notice the most are as follows dry mouth, appetite suppression, some irritability, and insomnia on occasion. Adderall XR for me last anywhere from 8-12 hours, if it wears off the medical professional in most cases will add Adderall IR to take in the afternoon, since upping the dose of XR will not increase duration only the intensity of the medication itself. ADHD medication is all about finding what’s right for YOU, don’t give up if it doesn’t get manageable or fixed after the first try.	9	November 8, 2020	42
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have always used Teva Adderall IR because I have had horrible experiences with other generic, including inconsistency and lack of potency.  Understand that I have taken Teva Adderall 20MG tablets over five years, thus it would less difficult for someone like me to detect subtle changes in its effects.  I have noticed the following, and this started around September 2020.  Teva generic Adderall tablets seem (and this is very subtle) smaller in size. Second: Teva is known for its slight sweet taste. It is almost as if that is completely  gone... I’m certainly not saying that added anything to it, but I’m saying it’s an indicator  of some sort of formula change.  Finally, although the 20MG tablet is small, it used to be easy to half the tablet. Recently they just crumble. To summarize, I have also noted a very marked decrease in efficacy.	7	November 7, 2020	26
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Adderall XR is Life changing (positively). I went from being massively distractable and procrastinate constantly to getting things done. I'm not just referring to school work or office work. I mean just showing up on time to meet up with friends. Not getting instantly bored with family.  I truly love it!   --- Quick warning, take it as your doctor recommends! So much of the bad press comes from people abusing the drug.  Likewise, if you're able, take a day off now and then. Perhaps on days when you don't need to work or do much. It's sort of like coffee/tea/caffeine in that sense. Fine if you do take it everyday, but probably best if you give your mind/body a rest from it now & then.

ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	My grades instantly went from the 60s and 70s to 90s and 100s and for once I felt like I had control over my life. The side effects were pretty bad and inconsistent though, so I had to go from 20 to 15 mg.	9	November 4, 2020	18
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	The Adderal dose my doctor prescribed didn't seem to work that great(20 mg twice a day)  One day I had it after my oatmeal and it was more effective so after that I just scrunched up the pill like I did with oatmeal, but I didn't put it on anything.  I just took it like that. Works great!  Much more motivation to get tasks done so I can finish more!  Maybe you could try that if it sees not enough to work.  I use Sandoz.	10	October 11, 2020	20
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Adderall XR was originally prescribed to me for ADD, but it worked best as a terrific antidepressant.  However, now that I've been on it for 20 straight years at 40-80 mg. Daily, it has very little antidepressant effect now. It's Adderall burnout -- apparently it strips the brain of dopamine -- the feel-good hormone.        I still have to take it just to do anything at all each day.  The worst effect is insomnia -- no matter how early I take it.  It keeps me up for 24 hours unless I finally have to take Seroquel for sleep.  Seroquel is the only thing that will knock out Adderall XR.  But I hate it because it makes me so damn sluggish in the morning, awful.        I cannot believe it's 2020, and there is still no decent antidep medication available,	8	October 1, 2020	31
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	The last 9 months generic “Zydus” was the only brand of amphetamine/dextroamphetamine available in my area. I noticed pretty nasty side effects beginning 45 minutes after consumption. I’ve never felt depression so severely before taking Zydus. Teva/Barr has returned. Felt a night and day difference the first day. Hope Zydus gets banned for the safety of us all.	1	September 23, 2020	20

ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I switched over to Mydayis in hope of finding something that could last the entire day. My days are usually nonstop for approx 16 hours. I started at the lowest dose and went up to the 50mg after 3 weeks. Gave it a few more weeks in hopes that it would work like how we wanted it to. The negative side effects outweigh the positives. The first thing I noticed was ejaculatory anhedonia. It led to an unplanned pregnancy before I caught it. The rest included falling behind in classes and not being able to keep up at work. Felt lazy and not wanting to do anything. It was like being unmedicated all over again!	4	September 21, 2020	8
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Generic Adderall:  TEVA vs. ALVOGEN “All generic adderall is NOT the same trust me!...... I don’t care what your physician or pharmacist may say.“  I’ve taken Adderall for nearly 25 plus years for ADD.  WHY? it works twice as good ask anyone whose taken different brands before. For the BEST quality and most potent adderall on the market is made by a company called TEVA.  Even pharmacist tell me when they run out of TEVA and must use ALVOGEN their patients complain because the pharmacies cannot keep TEVA in stock because the consumers know it’s the best and most effective for ADD and ADHD.	1	September 15, 2020	133
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have taken both Adderall and its generic(amphetamine/dextroamphetamine) for over 16 years for my Adult Attention Deficit Disorder. I have found that the original Adderall has the best effectiveness and in these last 4 tears Teva [still oval, peach/orange color] working the best for my A.D.D. Pills made by Mallinkrodt I only get by mistake, and still act like a placebo in May 2020. Dose: 20mg. X 2 daily.		August 25, 2020	24
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I do not like this formula. I have been on various generics for years and did not feel like this 10 mg did anything. Unfortunately, I've already filled this prescription and am stuck with this medication.	1	August 24, 2020	7
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been taking Adderall for most of my adult life and Walgreens always carried the generic version that worked best for me but recently they changed who they get it from now and the new amphetamine / dextroamphetamine from Lannett MFG SUCK!  They do not work at all - actually the worst next to the  YELLOW ROUND Mp 447's, PINK ROUND Cor 136's, or OCTAGON WHITE ONES.   The TEVA amphetamine/dextroamphetamine Peach Oval B 974's are the ones that work best for me and now I don' t know how to get them - Help..	10	June 16, 2020	94
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	My concern in taking generic Adderall IR for several years is the effect is has on my heart  When I take it, at the prescribed dose,  I most always have sinus tachycardia  (a heart rate above 100 beats per minute)  I also have noticed that it effects bladder emptying....and my urinary stream seems slower (and I am fairly young) and I am not usually able to completely empty my bladder.	6	June 10, 2020	26
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Since the shortage for about 3 months I've been taking generic Zydus 20mg. How do these drugs pass inspection? I think a couple pixie sticks would work better. I wonder if generic adderall from any manufacturer will ever get better. I think charging over $5.00 for this rubbish should be criminal.	1	June 7, 2020	40
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	This medication amphetamine/dextroamphetamine has made me feel VERY JITTERY and sick to my stomach! I take generic TEVA brand orange tab 30 mg. The pharmacy didn’t have any of the TEVA brand so they gave me generic U31 tablet - Aurolife Pharma, LLC brand. This is horrible! People take time off work to be seen by doctor, get put on meds for a reason, spend money for the appointment and meds, all the time you spend doing this & it can’t be returned back to Walmart to get my right medicine because “it’s against the law” supposedly! Even when I have the entire prescription (minus one) to give them back. Why make people feel like this when they do so much to try and make life easier being on their meds. I don’t have insurance so my doc visit is almost $100 & medicine is around $60 every month. My 7 year old daughters meds were switched as well. I’m scared to even give her medicine! How can Walmart just give you a different brand that you’ve never taken and not tell me before I leave it’s different!?	1	June 5, 2020	67
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I am a male in my thirties. Adderall is the third drug I tried to tread ADHD after doing trials on Vyvanse and Concerta. Vyvanse worked but did not last long enough and I had bad crashing (headache, exhaustion). Concerta did not work for me at all, made me lethargic and even more distracted.  Adderall at 20mg a day gives me energy to focus on work and my kids. It lasts me until sometime in the evening. I have trouble sleeping some nights on it, other than that the side effects are negligible.	8	May 3, 2020	43
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Activist Dextramp-amphet ER (30 mg.) [ generic for Adderall ]  is HORRIBLE. NOT effective. Causes nausea. HORRIBLE. I have taken this drug for over 3 years and I know what it is supposed to do.	1	April 30, 2020	40
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Adderall is very useful but recently I was ignorant and thought it would be okay to take a little extra at night to help clean my house. I took a bigger extra dose then I should have and a few hours later I felt pretty awful. I am very productive and more positive on the right dose of this med, so I recommend trying it or Desoxyn, because it is said to have fewer side effects like anxiety and panic and irritability post dose. Like all meds, Adderall is a blessing when dosed right and a curse when dosed incorrectly. I noticed that I paced around a bit when on it but I didn’t feel that anxious. It isn’t fun and enjoyable to take a big dose, don’t do it. God made everything to be used in moderation and it is much better for the whole society when we obey the wise instructions of our doctors and leaders. Be careful, obey your doctor, and may God bless you all to succeed in your treatment plans and in your lives. Amen	8	March 18, 2020	74
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	These batches have to improve. I can't even focus on anything and have narcolepsy.	1	March 10, 2020	35
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Recently changed pharmacies and didn't realize that there can be quite a difference between generics. For 4 years I’ve taken adderall 2x day, 10 mg. Never any problems until I switched pharmacies to save $.  Elite Pharma is who makes this new one and it is NOT GOOD.   I am lethargic, unable to focus, quite sleepy.  It’s as if I haven’t even taken anything.  Incredibly frustrating as I am not even half way through this months supply.	1	March 7, 2020	50
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	The generic manufacturer of amphetamine & dextroamphetamine, Sandoz, is the only one that works for me. This month the manufacturer is Northstar and last month Aurobindo, and they are garbage. They don’t help AT ALL with my focus. Zero.  I am irritable. I am getting nothing done and my anxiety is sky high. I am going to stop taking these brands and ask pharmacy for Sandoz.  I complained to the FDA and urge others to do so as well. This is ridiculous.	1	March 3, 2020	70
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Adderall has worked great for me when taken as needed. When I was in my early 20’s and taking it daily I built up a dependence that lead to terrible withdrawals as it is very addictive. (Learned the hard way and never want to go through that again!)  I will usually only take this when my ADHD symptoms are unbearable and my work/personal life starts to become affected. We are talking maybe 1-4 tablets max per month.  It really does help with focus and energy, and I find that one 10-20mg dose is usually enough and I feel good for several days after the dose without any withdrawals or dependence issues.

ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Laura, CVS in Kansas City and probably elsewhere exclusively carry SANDOZ. With goodrx my 60 tablets of 20mg are 28$	9	February 22, 2020	32
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	If you're taking for ADHD please note there are a lot of side effects, having said this, they are sometimes serious so take note to talk to your doctor. If you get cold fingers or toes, make sure to consult your doctor as it's a syndrome that can be prevented.  It does help with focus, it helps with impulse control, it helps with a general overall euphoric feeling and it can cause you to lose a lot of weight. Be sure to eat, EAT, don't shake your head, you know I'm talking to you. Eat and stay hydrated it causes you to urinate a LOT, make sure to supplement what you are losing. It will cause tremors, shakes, and irritability, again, eat food. Make sure to stick to a 2000 calorie diet AT LEAST. May cause muscle fatigue and extreme soreness, stay hydrated, make sure of this.  Some say it causes better grades in school, well, to an extent. It just makes you write a lot. Eat Eat Hydrate And maybe take melatonin to help promote rest. I warned and entertained you.	7	February 21, 2020	97
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	My daughter developed tardive dyskinesia, a permanent drug-induced movement disorder, while on Adderall. If your kid has ODD, stay away from all stimulates; they are most at-risk.	1	February 19, 2020	26
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I totally agree that the new A 79 generics are no good.  I mean they work a little bit, but I feel taking the same amount of the other oblong orange ones that taste like sweet we’re way better.  These taste like nasty chalk.    I’ve never had adderal brand though so I wouldn’t that difference.	3	February 19, 2020	25
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been on  adderal 15mg 2×daily  for 7 yrs it has completely change my life.  I  was always down, depressed, unmotivated, impulsive, always day dreaming, short attention span, no focus and couldn't sitting still. Adderal has given me a new happy life that I can enjoy and appreciate. Starting to think I need to go up to 20mg. I can feel I'm getting used to them. But without them I wouldn't get out of bed and would waste my life.I  think adderal is my miracle drug I have never been so grateful for a prescription drug	10	February 17, 2020	111
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I was diagnosed with ADHD combined type and have tried Ritalin and Focalin. Both weren't that great for me so my doctor prescribed me 10 mg of Adderall XR. Adderall has made me have better multitasking skills and helped me pay attention. It hasn't really helped with being hyper or being impulsive and has given me bad twitching eyes. It also has made my sleep schedule weird so watch out for that.	6	February 6, 2020	23
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Picked up amphetamine with dextroamphetamine medicine 1/24/20, bottle said Barr brand? But Teva tabs were inside. Teva bought Barr in 07. Before Teva bought out multiple companies and started using their ingredients within the last 2-3 years, they were great. Sandoz and Corepharma have been the only other decent makers, before they were bought out. I haven’t noticed a thing from picking these up 1/24. The worst medicine I’ve had from Teva in 8 years.	1	February 4, 2020	36
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	On 1/24/2020 I received Teva generic IR Adderall like I usually have for the last 7 years off and on (used to be good.) Except Barr was labeled on the bottle for the first time ever. Not sure why since Teva bought Barr in 07. Regardless it isn’t any better, by far the worst I’ve had of Teva. But every other company is pathetic. Brand works 10X better but 10X pricier. If the FDA enforced the rule of not less than 80% and no more than 125% concentrated effectiveness, that would be a first! The right MG of each dose might be regulated, but the fillers/inactive ingredients added is the big issue. 1-3 used to be in the old Barr/ Shire/ Sandoz/ Core and those worked fantastic. Every generic now has 5-8 fillers that make it less effective but also cause severe side effects. FDA could care less about small market drugs.	1	February 3, 2020	50
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Game changer. First DX by A pdoc: ADHD. What, no?  Yes.  I felt like I was only working with one puzzle piece and finding out about ADHD was like being given the other 999 pieces. At first Adderall IR didn’t seem to do much but I slowly realized it was like putting emotional and mental blinders on where I could see the rest of the world but mainly focus on the task at hand. Job saver for sure.  Since I have a high tolerance to meds XR saved me from constantly trying to remember to take next dose when I started crashing. Tops.	10	February 3, 2020	30
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have found the generic brand for Adderall is not effective as the brand name. The Epic brand caused me to have severe depression, blurred vision, headaches, very tired and no focus at all.  I’m trying to find a brand that is much like the name brand. Looking for suggestions if anyone can share please. Thanks	1	January 29, 2020	97
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I went to pharmacy to pick up my Adderall generic brand Zydus. I was told they was out of my brand. I was given the Epic brand. The Epic brand caused me to have severe depression and I stayed in bed, I’ve always been very energetic. I stopped taking it. I called the Pharmacist and reported the side effects I had. Pharmacist didn’t act surprised at all, stated we are out of your regular brand and probably won’t get it back in.	1	January 28, 2020	18
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Generics make me feel ill, sometimes headache, sometimes itching or hives.  Google where generics are made.	1	January 24, 2020	45
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	"I was so glad to see these posts.  Pharmacies are so rude to me. I switched to so many brands, but they say they are all alike, and say it doesn't matter which generic I get, because they're all the same.  My doctor, unfortunately, thinks the same.  I finally said to the pharmacy tech one day, ""I'm sure I'm not the only one, who would like certain generics."" She said, no, I'm the only one. I know this sounds crazy, but the blue 10mg of teva, don't seem to work like the 15mg of the peach teva, even if I cut one of the blue in half to make it 15mg."	8	January 23, 2020	92
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I was taking 15mg of generic Adderall  amphetamine / dextroamphetamine  for 3 months and by the end of the 3rd month I had 3 separate people tell me I didn't seem myself. I'm a regularly joyful and excited person but every emotion I had felt muted or stunted while on amphetamine/dextroamphetamine. I stopped talking it and 3 days later felt so much better. I was joyful again! Back to pinging all over the place but at least I'm happy doing it lol. I'm trying Concerta next.	4	January 21, 2020	3
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Ok so I have Both Narcolepsy/Extreme Fatigue & ADD. The generic forms of Adderall (amphetamine and dextroamphetamine) seem to be getting worse and worse. They are making them with obviously cheaper so-called similar ingredients but the new generic amphetamine and dextroamphetamine drugs just have bad side effects and don’t work for me at all or are far less effective. I don’t know if it is Teva brand that is making these cheap ineffective knock-offs that cause migraines & other side effects but they are definitely not working or decent. The generic form Amphetamine Salts works just fine for me but again I think when Teva took over and apparently used far cheaper Ingres there is definitely a disconnect because I don’t think Dextroamp-Amphetamin is a worthy generic form of Adderall but maybe just because Teva brand seems to be using incredibly cheap ingredients,	10	January 20, 2020	21
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I've had ONE DOSE.  Let me be clear.  I took one 25mg pill 6 hours ago and I'm so sleepy I can't see straight.  I slept 7.5 hours last night so I don't understand the drowsiness.	5	January 9, 2020	33
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’ve been on adderall for a few years now and it was life changing. I’ve always been prescribed a generic and have never had a problem until recently. I noticed that I was not getting the same benefit as I was previously and for months, tried to convince myself that it was in my head and then one month, I noticed everyday that I felt great! Looked at the pill imprint and what do you know - it was a different manufacture (Amneal) than the one I was taking. I started googling it and saw a lot of complaints for generic Adderall from Global Pharmaceutical. I’m talking to pharmacist today about it and requesting the generic by Amneal Pharmaceuticals. I thought they were all the same and it’s a shame that global can make these any less effective than what they should be. Is it so people go to their dr, say they don’t feel the effects of it and get an increase? Sounds like a big pharma thing to do. Trust your gut instinct because you’re the person who knows you best.	1	January 8, 2020	17
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	"I recently was given this new form of adderall from the pharmacy which was circular with just an ""A"" on one side... I did not like this new form of Adderall at all!! I assumed it would have the same effect as the typical oval shaped and it was completely different which is a little scary. It was very bitter and gross tasting unlike the football shaped one has a sweet note. It also disintegrated turning to powder immediately, as I attempted to break it in half (waste of product). I did not get any focus from it nor did I feel any different at all?? It did nothing! Then the next day got a horrible headache! I was talking with a friend who also mentioned getting the same thing recently. He mentioned having an extremely bad headache too the following day, so we now know it's from this form of adderall. I DO NOT LIKE IT. It should be pulled from the market honestly I don't know what the heck this rubbish  is but it is not adderall."	2	January 2, 2020	79
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Was first diagnosed with ADD(inattentive type) by multiple doctors at 18 years old. Out of the gate they prescribed me 60mg IR amphetamine with dextroamphetamine. I am now 26, taking 80mg/day, and have learned a substantial amount about this drug. No it won't make you any smarter or develop hidden talents, most believe this. The generic (dextroamphetamine-amphetamine IR) is cheaper than its brand (Adderall xr.) Obviously brand is set to higher standards of quality than generics, so yes brand name anything works better than generics, it's common sense. If you use it correctly and find the right manufacturer like Teva, you most likely won't find as many negatives as most people.	8	December 30, 2019	9
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’ve been taking the generic version of Adderall for about 2 years now. I was tired all the time and couldn’t focus. I felt like a slug and when I had energy I still had brain fog, and had a hard time studying. In class, I would fidget in my chair, doodle, and listen to lectures, but nothing would stick in my head. No matter how long I studied.  I was prescribed the 7.5 mg tablet once a day and just the small dose did wonders for my energy levels and let me focus and actually get things done. It helped me talk in social situations and gave me a mood boost.  That being said, The generics changed a couple times. And I’m not sure, but I think I can tell a difference between them. After the pill wears off, my head aches, my legs throb, my body aches, and I’m nauseous and feel sick. I have flu like symptoms, which are miserable. It’s sad because it’s a really small dose and helps me so much but some of the side effects suck. You just gotta see what’s worth it to you.	8	December 24, 2019	61
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	This medication does not work at all now.	1	December 2, 2019	49
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Not very effective; I took a  double dose which cause headaches and made me generally feel ill.  There are  better generics. Company should not be allowed to sell this medication.	1	November 17, 2019	13
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been on Adderal 10 mg for three months now. I have found it helps me so much in the morning. I need to talk to my doctor and see if I can get something for the afternoon. It's been a godsend but I don't have any anger issues just a lot of anxiety. I'm on Xanax as well three times a day and Ambien for sleep which really helps bed by 5 clock I'm wore out. And then my symptoms seem to return. I would recommend this to anyone that has concentration issues. I'm 41 years old and when I went to school they always called you slow. Which always made you look bad. I think my doctor he's wonderful and I'm going to get my Xanax upped and see if I can get something for the afternoon due to that I work many hours a day and I have to be on my toes.	9	November 2, 2019	6
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I got diagnosed with ADHD at the beginning of this school year, being my senior year of high school. Since 8th grade, I've struggled in school, been incredibly impulsive, had very strange eating habits, over-thought everything, and could never contain my anger or anxiety. Once prescribed, my life has changed. My grades went up, and in 3 months I've lost almost 30 pounds (I am still in the normal BMI range). I can control myself. I finally believe in myself because of Adderall.	9	October 29, 2019	80
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Well been on and off Adderall or Ritalin since I was 5. I'm 62 now, and take 60mg XR morning and two 30mg IR in the afternoon. For me it's a Godsend. I can pay attention now,  I'm more sociable, I'm just.......me.	8	October 23, 2019	22
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’m 48 yo woman that was diagnosed with ADHD in elementary.  When I began (on holiday) taking it I’m extremely fatigue/zombie the first 3 days, I am not nearly as engaged with anyone/anything around me (I talk 97% less when I’m on Adderall) and it makes me feel less cognitive.  I feel like it dumbs me down.  After the 3rd day I start to feel better and those “tranquilizer effects” go away. Adderall is an emotional regulator for me. It works wonders for my impulsivity, racing thoughts, fidgeting, feeling overwhelmed, anger, anxiety, zoning out, and my mouth. Yes, my mouth has always been my biggest challenge and has caused me tremendous social/professional problems.  While in a perfect world I’d be on no medication, I have to recommend Adderall for anyone whose suffering from ADHD, because  it has changed my overall quality of life for the best.  Sparkle on beautiful people! 	9	October 23, 2019	81
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I was diagnosed with both bipolar and ADHD. After trying multiple combinations, we finally tried adderall on top of Wellbutrin, Lamictal, and Fluvoxamine for OCD. At first, the adderall did wonders. Completely made me enjoy life again. However, as my tolerance increased, the adderall crash was very intense. It resulted in a bipolar low almost everyday around the same time. I recently just switched to Stratetta and is my second day taking it. Anxious to see how this works.	9	October 22, 2019	29
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’ve been taking meds for ADHD/ADD close to 8 years now.  Tried Adderall at many dosages, types and amount of times per day over a period of many years.  My biggest issue. I forgot to take them.  Tried Vyvanse. It helped but I got nauseous, dizzy every day.  Tried Adderall again and forgot to take them.  One day my doctor mentioned Mydayis. I wouldn’t have to remember taking more than one in the AM.  After a week I could tell that it was helpful but wasn’t able to tell if a BIG difference.  I ran out due to scheduling once & my brain went into hyper drive. I hadn’t felt that chaotic for awhile.  WHILE talking to my doctor she legit wrote out the prescription, handed it to me. ‘go fill it NOW.’ Even had others asking how long I would be without it.  It was clear it helped at that point.  I don’t notice any side effects.  My results with Mydayis are pretty good. No worries of forgetting it, which was the major factor in my switch.	8	October 20, 2019	11
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I'm making this review one year after trying Mydayis for only a week. I switched to this drug from Adderall IR 20's BID to the 37mg capsule, you don't really think your buzzing, but you indeed are, and more so than with Adderall for the same dose. What prompted me to write this review was that I noticed someone else who reviewed this mentioned that they would be returning the bottle to the pharmacy because they didn't want insurance to think they were keeping it. This is an effect of the drug, I too, even though I bought it on the $5 coupon, did not want the pharmacy (who does not care) to think that I wanted to keep this drug so I returned the remaining 23 capsules to them. It works well, puts you in a different state of mind, and doesn't provide the sense well being of some other ADHD products offer, but it does work better than some generics. Perhaps give this a try if you're on generics that don't work. It is pretty strong, but doesn't feel like it. if that makes sense.	7	October 14, 2019	12
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I was on 10MG XR for 3 months and it worked amazingly. This is a very good medication if you have trouble functioning like a normal person, although be prepared for really dark thoughts if you decide to stop taking it. Withdrawal from this drug is no joke, it can make you want to die...but if you keep taking it or taper off slowly you should be fine.		October 12, 2019	22
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I was diagnosed with ADD in 2005 after experiencing horrible distractibility in class while at college and not being able to focus on a single thought in my head.  I was prescribed Adderall IR and I remember feeling like I had drunk 5 Red Bulls or something!  My heart was pounding and I had horrible anxiety the whole day.  I only took it one time.  I decided to get off it immediately.  Soon after, I was prescribed Strattera, which didn't do ANYTHING.  I've gone for about 13 years without actual ADD medications because I really hated the idea of stimulants.  That all changed when I realized my ADD was getting out of control.  I saw my current psychiatrist last week who re-diagnosed me and we discussed my experiences.  I had read reviews from people here who say that Dexedrine works for them if Adderall made them too wired, so I asked if I could try that.  I just tried it today and I had no horrible side effects - no anxiety, no heart palpitations, no edginess, etc.  It is wonderful!	1	October 9, 2019	21
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have suffered my entire life with ADD.  For a while Adderal helped. Then as I turned 49 it seemed to make me more anxious, irritable,  short tempered, and I had No patience for stupidity! Upon trying the Mydayis,  I was immediately impressed. I was finishing projects.  Getting things done right! Able to focus for longer durations of time. Long enough to complete tasks at hand. I feel so much better.	10	October 3, 2019	30
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I will never give this to my child again!, I know all children are different but I'm sticking with Dyanavel XR. While he was on Adderall he was acting angry and violent, like he was on some kind of illegal drug, his facial expressions were intense, and he could not sit still, and was very emotional. so I have to give this a 1 star on my personal experience and my son's	1	October 2, 2019	35
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I've had a prescription for amphetamine with dextroamphetamine for  four years, and Teva used to work fairly well for me. Over the last year or so, it's become awful. I know it isn't me, because I still have old (2-3 years) pills laying around; I tried some of them and they work just fine.   Teva changed something in the manufacturing process. The new pills do almost nothing beneficial (I feel sleepy all day), but they have a ton of side effects. I feel very jittery, my stomach hurts, and I've been experiencing bloating.	1	September 30, 2019	23
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Overall, 20 mg Adderall XR for ADHD helps me to focus. The problem with adderall is it makes me sweat something awful. Anyone else annoyed with sweating while taking adderall?	9	September 28, 2019	62
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Well first off. Adderall is an Amphetamine  which assist with the production of dopamine. Very close  relation to meth. I am 21 years old and I started Adderall again. Previously I was on Adderall from age 8-13 and it worked great. Some say ADHD is not real and it just a symptom of bad health etc... I have been very very healthy and unhealthy which produced no changed in brain fog. Now that engineering is my main task in like I seem to have a hefty amount of brain fog. Adderall does in fact help with focus but the downside is the extreme crashes that happen when you stop taking it.	8	September 26, 2019	20
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been on Adderall for quite sometime. It has helped me focus and also being proactive. I recently got a new script and diff manufacturing teva  I noticed since I have taken it I'm extremely tired. Cannot focus at all I feel like a scatter brain..I had to call my dr to have him rewrite a new script and surrender the Teva (amphetamine with dextroamphetamine) Did anyone get the same reaction?	1	September 26, 2019	20
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I shared my experience recently on here and was going back over and reading others as well.  I believe we should all state the laboratory that producing the specific generic we are each taking. Doing so may help us all narrow down which ones to stay away from and which ones are truly therapeutic.  Eon lab  brand of amphetamine/dextroamphetamine was good until 9 months ago, now they are horrible (no therapeutic value and bad side effects).  I then I switched to Teva and they were decent for about 2 months and now they are giving me side effects.  Plus the pharmacy ran out of them and I had to wait for a new batch and when the new batch came in is when the bad side effect started.  I KNOW the drug manufacturer has changed something.  Hope that helps someone.	2	September 24, 2019	122
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	So, I have had ADHD since I was like young. I never liked the pills they gave me when I was younger because I was already a thin kid and then taking Adderall I would eat even less. So I stopped taking the medication. When I was taking this medication I got most improved student! I went without the drug for years, until just about 2 years ago I started taking it again and It has helped me so much! I am very thankful for this drug. I suffer from fatigue , and many, many other problems. This drug is one of many I NEED, To Think Straight and to not get outta control.  It also helps me BIG TIME with my anger issues. Hope this helps someone! Star Kid Is OUT!	9	September 11, 2019	47
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	This drug is one of the greatest formulas of all time. I went from down and depressed and unmotivated to organized and focused. Also from relatively poor to rich due the effect it had on me with my enthusiasm for work	10	September 11, 2019	57
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I cannot believe that the FDA allows AUROBINDO or TEVA to sale their lousy drugs through pharmacies in the US.  Neither of these generics have any affect on me at all!!  WASTE of money!   They are playing with people's minds and well being!!!!	2	September 6, 2019	110
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Have taken Adderall on and off for around 13 years for ADD and CFS. I was lucky enough to have tried the “real” brand Adderall by Barr laboratories. I’ve never taken over 20mg a day. This medicine has gone to TRASH.The only negative side affect from the Barr version was occasional jaw clinching.   I think Teva must’ve burned the patent formula or something because it has never worked liked the Barr, not even close.  So many negative side effects (migraine headaches, heartburn, nausea)! I keep hoping at some point they might magically start producing a decent version that actually helps instead of hurts.  The original Barr had true therapeutic value.  Eon labs produced a decent generic for a while, but BAM, it suddenly went to garbage at the end of 2018.  So switched back to Teva a couple months back and it started ok( not as good as Eon but better than everything else out there), then last months refill is feeling like they’re changing to something bad too.  Bring back real Adderall!	3	September 4, 2019	78
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I had taken Adderall for many years and was slowly on the decline.  I was deeply depressed and had an absolute hopeless and helpless outlook on life with no relief. I had psychosis, delusions and impulsive behavior which I never had. I began having issues with memory, thinking, reasoning, decision making, tasks, and  concentration.  I would become very agitated if being interrupted. I was very aggressive and agitated constantly, it was at least 98% of the time in 10 years.  I read horror stories about stimulants, namely the Amphetamine line of them. I subsequently tapered off of them and feel 100% better than before. I have no depressive symptoms, delusions, memory problems, agitation or aggressiveness. I was not happy with life and my personal relationships were very toxic. I wasted almost 10 years of my life feeling like this and have other personal complications that resulted from the use of these toxic drugs.	1	August 28, 2019	29
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I'm all shook up. But it works!	9	August 26, 2019	20
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Works well for my adult ADHD. It gets me motivated, and I can feel it kicking in. The perfect dosage for me is the 15mg tablet, morning, and another 15mg after lunchtime! I score the 30mg tablet in half.	9	August 22, 2019	6
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I've had ADHD since I was a kid and after a couple of years taking Ritalin I stopped and then tried it again once in my 20's and again in my 30's but never liked the way it made me feel. Starting in my late 30's I started to suffer from chronic fatigue syndrome which doesn't mix well with ADHD. It puts the body and mind in a bad place. I finally got around to going to the doctor and he recommended that I take Adderall 3 times a day. This has been such a benefit to my life. Not only do I have the energy to get out of bed I can now focus enough to get some daily life stuff done.	10	August 13, 2019	9
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	First prescribed it in grad school for ADD & depression. Worked wonders. Only downside is I became very reliant on it. Was stuck between the two evils of being a depressed zombie (w/o taking it) and feeling like a happy, motivated, focused person (on Adderall). Eventually stopped taking and failed out of grad school. Work was hard, always late, made stupid mistakes, & couldn’t complete tasks. 3 years & 3 jobs later, I broke down and went back to a doctor who rediagnosed me with ADD, Anxiety, & Depression. I was reluctant to start back on Adderall and tried a few alternatives first. Everything made me feel even MORE exhausted; back on Adderall 30mg day; feel normal again. I have the motivation, energy, & focus to complete tasks. Only complaint is anxiety which I resolve w/ a low benzo & exercise. Remember, there’s no reason to be miserable if there’s a pill out there that can change your life.	7	August 10, 2019	103
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	"I've finally found it. - Mydayis it is that little reminder I never had; the missing piece of my conscience that was never there before to tell me ""stop mucking and go do the stuff you should be getting on with"""	7	August 5, 2019	31
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	This medicine initially seemed to work very well for me with improved concentration but after taking it for only 6 months I discontinued it due to anxiety levels being through the roof to the point where I couldn’t function. This was enhanced during social interactions of which is ironic because I know many people say they experience increased desire for social activities. A month after stopping medicine, I started experience psychotic symptoms of which have not subsided. I do not suggest this medicine.	4	August 3, 2019	18
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I'm 19. I've tryed a lot of ADHD medication (I'm from Canada so I have less option than the US). Concerta, Biphentin, Vyvanse. With all these medication I've experienced sides effects, or, in the case of Vyvanse, I was not focused enough. And now I'm on Adderall XR and I can tell you than is the best ADHD medication I've tried. I feel like I can multi-task like Vyvanse but more focus, and this focus make all the difference. I don't feel a lot of sides effects, and they are nothing if I compare with Concerta or Biphentin. and Adderall XR is one of the only ADHD medication with generic availability in Canada!	9	August 2, 2019	23
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Adderall X R 30mg in the morning along with 5mg of Adderall in the early afternoon seem to help my mood and condition dramatically. If you are ADHD I recommend talking with your psychiatrist.	10	August 2, 2019	24
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Started off with  Adderall  5 mg IR twice daily.  Overall, this is a very low dose.  I have found it was more effective and safer to take it every couple of days.  At least for me.  I have tried 40mg and 60mg before so I am very aware of how intense it can be.  If you take it every day you will end up increasing the dosage.  Try to use it sparingly and try doing activities that produce dopamine naturally like exercise or walking and listening to music.  This will help you feel healthier while taking it.  Overall I think it is helpful but definitely feels unnatural and can't believe they give speed to children.  	5	July 30, 2019	35
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I asked my doctor about Mydayis because it lasts 16 hours.    The first week I was so calm, never been so calm in my life, even with antidepressants. I was able to focus during conversations. I organized my desk (a little). Cleaned my car out (a little). My second week i was still focusing but I couldn't eat. I was repulsed by anything other than fruits, vegetables, cereal. But then I felt dizzy...sick to my stomach. My eyes seem to move involuntarily   Nystagmus )mand I got the worst eye strain I've ever had. My neck muscles felt extremely tight and I just kept massaging my neck trying not to panic. I tried to tough it out for the next 2 days but could not. It's been day 2 days since I quit taking it and my eyes are still involuntarily moving a little. I had big hopes for this med but this is how it worked it for me and I was only taking 12.5 mg.  I just needed to let everyone know about this possibility because I couldn't find any info about it. It would probably be considered a tic.	3	July 27, 2019	28
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Diagnosed ADD 18 y/o, on and off Adderall IR since then. Too high a dose causes psychosis...be forewarned. I used to be on 30mg 3x/day, now I'm leary of taking more than 2.5mg 2x/day. Maybe it builds up in the brain, so be sure to take breaks from it often. I notice the side effects outweigh the benefits at higher doses....irritability, zombie-like come-down. My insurance only covers this and Ritalin, so I'm stuck with bad side-effects.	4	July 23, 2019	19
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	"Adderall is literally the only THING Period that I have tried that has improved my life in the slightest (I have ADD/Treatment-Resistant Depression ) - I got my Bachelors degree in Health & Psychology, I tried EVERY supplement herb, nootropic, etc. I'm commenting here is because of all the people saying how it drained them, or over time began making them feel worse - you need to educate yourself - one of the most important being, be SURE to be supplementing with TYROSINE, literally daily (tyrosine converts into Dopamine - like how 5-HTP converts to Serotonin) just like how SSRI's eventually ""poop out"" and just stop working (because they've used up the bodies natural serotonin) Adderall will eventually ""poop out"" on you, stop working, yet even worse when this happens, the more you take the WORSE you feel because its like revving an engine with no gasoline left in it!!! Theres plenty more to look into but even just taking Tyrosine makes a HUGE difference!"	8	July 19, 2019	97
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Adderall is all fun and games until you become addicted and try to stop taking it. I loved and still love Adderall, just like all of the positive reviews here - it works like nothing else, but I will never take it again.  I quit Adderall June of 2018 and it was the worst thing I ever went through - everything you read online about stimulant withdrawal is true x100. It’s almost impossible to successfully wean off of this medication. I went cold turkey 3x before I was finally successful.  It took me months to feel “normal” again.  During this time my life went downhill and I started up again December 2018 at a low dose, which before I knew it increased back to me 40mg dose.  I just quit Adderall again because I will be trying to get pregnant at the end of this year and it was once again a battle but I managed to do it. I will NEVER go back on this medication. Ever. It took me 2 hard lessons to realize how bad this medication is for you and your brain.	1	July 17, 2019	3
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I do not recommend anyone taking Adderall. I was unable to eat or sleep while taking this medication. It caused severe stunting of my growth.	1	July 17, 2019	8
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	"I have always known that I had ADD. However, I was in grad school, and I was studying for up to 10-12 hours a day. I found myself reading and re-reading and was having a hard time retaining information, because I couldn't stay focused. I would study for hours. Long story short, for my master's degree, I had to take practice timed test for NP boards, I failed it. My instructor told me to get tested for ADHD,  and get on medications. I did, and it was the best thing I have ever done, and wish I did it sooner, it cut my studying by half, because I'm very focused. I didn't have to request extra time for my NP boards, and I passed with time to spare. I have no side effects; incr. HR, BP, I eat and exercise, and don't take it late in afternoon to avoid insomnia. I only take it when I study and not everyday.  I believe it's about making the drug work for you and not let the drug control you.  Medication ""holidays"" are great to do."	10	July 13, 2019	36
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	If it wasn’t for Adderall I would be a basket case no questions asked. I'm 55 been on it since 2014 on an everyday basis. I'll take a day off every so often, but it's a rare occasion. My Blood Pressure is 122/74- pulse 64 when moving around normally. Resting my BP is lower along with the pulse rate. If you are relatively healthy heart wise no problems. I know one guy who's pushing 76 years old and he's still taking his prescribed dosage.	10	July 8, 2019	35
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	My son developed tics and we stopped the Adderall medication. Tics remain and one day he hit his head until no hair was there. He also now has blood in his stool no one can explain. Hmmm well permanent  damage isn’t worth the education we are providing now. I would rather buy a franchise than a college degree.	1	July 7, 2019	5
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been taking ADHD Medications for years. I have found that the Generic  Adderall ( Extended Release 20 mg) by Amneal Pharmaceuticals LLC. (CAPSULES STAMPED g454) ARE NOT as effective as other brands	2	July 2, 2019	7
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I've been on and off Adderall IR for the last year. When I'm on Adderall the first 3 months is amazing! I feel highly attentive and motivated. I have to take sleep meds because I'm so wired. The negative is the crash I feel by 6pm. It's like I transform into Angry Smurf - no longer talkative or cheerful and forgot about sex -- my libido shut down. My greatest battle is with food.  I am constantly hungry and when I eat the meds seem to lose its potency therefore causing me to skip meals. I built a tolerance rather quickly on this stuff and it lost its efficacy. IN ANY CASE, DO NOT INCREASE YOUR DOSAGES. Instead take a break from Adderall and try another drug for a couple of months.  This drug is not meant for long term use. Just few month. anything longer is just going to create a monster out of you.	6	July 1, 2019	17
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been taking 50mg of Mydayis for a few months now and I have been happy with my experience on this medicine. I have been on several regimens, including Vyvanse 70 + Dexedrine 10 booster, Adderall XR + Dexedrine 10 booster, Adderall xr + adderall 10 booster, Focalin XR, etc but I decided to give Mydayis a go since my new insurance has it covered on its formulary ($50 a month copay). Like others have said this drug runs in the background but I find it much more consistent and wayyyy longer acting than Adderall XR and even longer than Vyvanse, which only lasted 6 hours max for me. I take it at 5:30am and feel the medicine until about 5pm (~10 hours give or take). Mydayis less anxiety-provoking but I still feel like my ADHD symptoms are controlled around the clock and yet at the same time I feel more like myself than I did strung out on the other medicines. If you’re looking for an option that lasts a long while and your insurance will help pay for it I, think it’s a good option.	10	May 1, 2021	0
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have received my second refill of generic Adderall XR 20 mg made by Mallinckrodt and I am extremely unhappy with it. It is not at all effective. I have been on the non-generic Adderall XR for years without issue.	1	April 29, 2021	1
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have taken Adderall XR and short acting for 25 years and I got this new XR 30MG the other day Lannett and it made me tired, heart racing, BP accelerated and did NOTHING to help me focus. I contacted the pharmacy and my Dr and he's trying to switch me to another brand because this is a joke. awful..	1	April 26, 2021	6
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Just started taking adderall XR 10mg after learning I had been mis-diagnosed for 15+ years as either bi-polar, major depressive disorder and social anxiety. I finally found a psychiatrist that really dug deep and concluded I was not bi polar but I suffered from adult ADHD (33 year old male). It makes total sense as I read more about ADHD. I had been on every possible anti-depressant, anti psychotic MDD etc and was just done with meds. I was diagnosed as a child and teen but thought “ I’d grow out of it” and apparently never did it just got worse. I feel that so many people are mis-diagnosed it’s almost unbelievable. My theory and the doctor also said that if you take the medication and it calms you and your racing thoughts that that’s a tell tail sign that you do indeed suffer from ADHD, it’s not just a childhood/school era problem, it disrupts your life, marriage everything. I’m on day 2 and it’s like a light switch has been turned on and I can relax and not be manic.	9	April 25, 2021	4
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been on and off generic Adderall for many years. Currently, I have been prescribed 30 mg twice a day. For the last couple of months, it's been a nightmare. It's been on backorder and then changed the generic name from amphetamine salts combo to amphetamine/ dextroamphetamine combo. This is only because I have had severe headaches, extreme fatigue, and a loss of motivation. My ADHD has been out of the roof. It's frustrating because I feel like I did before taking any generic Adderall. I have even been concerned that maybe I was receiving a placebo rather than the actual medication. That's probably far-fetched, but it's been such a decline for me. There is something missing from this generic form and it is the essential thing that is needed to control my ADHD. I have even gained a lot of weight over the past two months. Hopefully, something will give, I can't imagine it affecting people like this and nothing changing.	3	April 19, 2021	8
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	This pill does not work like any Adderall that I have experienced. There is neither the focus or the energy bump that is typically associated with the two most therapeutic aspects of the formulation. The vast majority of time I feel equally as sleepy and unfocused as I did when I took it.    I am an experienced user of this positive life-changing medication. The patients that us this medication are in a bad position when company’s that make inferior generic medications are allowed distribution rights through equally as corrupt retail pharmaceutical outlets seeking to make a few pennies extra per script, on the back of patients whose experienced opinion is rarely considered.	2	April 17, 2021	2
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have taken ADHD meds many years. Adderall XR is the ADHD med that works the best for me. I am taking a generic manufactured by Lannett. It by far has worked the best for me with the reason(s) being is the smoothness, the come up is very quick, and it does it's job perfectly.   To reiterate, Lannett is very smooth with a quick come up, and last long enough most days.	9	April 15, 2021	4
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	If anyone else is having a terrible time with the new Lannett generic adderall you can report this to the FDA.  I have been having crippling headaches, stomach aches, and the medication doesn’t even feel like it works!!! I get tired after I take it and then can’t sleep all night because of it. HORRIBLE.

ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Right now I take 50mg Lamictal for my Bipolar and 7.5mg twice a day Adderall for ADHD. At first I wasn't sure Adderall was going to work for me, I was initially prescribed 20mg twice a day.  That dose ended up being way too high for me, It made be become manic and I felt really wired all the time.  I now take 7.5mg twice a day and have found it to be much better. I feel alert and focused throughout the day.  Some of the side effects I have had are weight loss, jaw clenching, and mild insomnia (I usually just take melatonin). Overall, Adderall has helped me a lot, I just had to find the right dosage.	8	April 8, 2021	0
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been on Adderall for several years and the Sandoz brand is TOXIC and HORRIBLE! At first it is like a sugar pill no effect and then dizziness, headache, feeling more confused, spaced out and mind blank, extreme fatigue. I can't believe this is on the market. FDA honestly needs to step up their game and monitor the generics. It is a up and down roller coaster with different manufactures each month. This is insane. They are robbing us blind in the pharmaceutical business. They give us something toxic or a placebo. What is happening to the medications now. Please do not take the Sandoz. Read the court documents about reviews on them and they came from the company. Making themselves sound great as a pretend customer!! I can not believe how bad this medication from this manufacture is.	1	April 6, 2021	10
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Worked really well for the first week or so, but then really made me more irritable and gave me uncontrollable suicidal urges that ultimately sent me to the hospital. The suicidal urges stopped after dropping the medication.  I wouldn't recommend against the medication, I would just proceed with caution as the side effects can vary in intensity from person to person.	1	April 3, 2021	3
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been prescribed Amphetamine Salt Combo which has worked well(I have ADD and narcolepsy).

ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’ve been on Adderrall immediate release for at least 8 years, probably more. At first Adderrall gave me an intense high and made me very talkative. Very talkative. That lasted for a few days and after that each morning when I took it it gave me a euphoric feeling for about have the day. I wasn’t making impulsive decisions like I had in the past and my focus was razor sharp. I really enjoyed this drug for sometime but the last 3-5 years it’s just been the same old same old. I take it in the morning and have somewhat of a boost in energy and focus but after around 11am the effects of the medication just wears off. I wind up feeling irritable, decent level of focus if I’m busy at work, and just downright not very social with people. This week I’m going to see my P.A. and hopefully get on Vyvanse which I was encouraged by many to try before jumping on Adderrall. Vyvanse is more expensive but I’m ready to feel more focused and more myself.	5	March 28, 2021	4
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	This review is for generic Adderall XR - amphetamine/dextroamphetamine. I've experienced wildly different effects from different manufacturers. Some days it didn't work. Some days it worked great. But I got severe debilitating headaches that lasted 24/7 and didn't go away using ibuprofen. Went to neurologist and got an MRI. If I could push past the side effects it did work well but for only about 4-5 hours after kicking in (which took about an hour). Needed a booster of IR in the afternoon, so eventually I couldn't deal with the headaches and switched to IR completely. Headaches gone almost immediately. I still get them with IR but not anywhere near as often or as bad.	6	March 23, 2021	1
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	"I've tried several ADHD meds and Mydayis has definitely been the best for me. I'm on the lowest dose and it starts working 20-30 minutes after I take it. I'm then able to be productive and direct my focus easily, compared to other meds (eg-Adderall) which gave me a burst of intense focus that I had no control over. The transitions are barely noticeable and it really helps maintain consistent energy levels. After wearing off, it's a very natural ""I've worked all day and now I'm ready to relax before bed"" feeling (no crash). I also noticed it significantly helps manage my depression-something no other ADHD med has done. The only downsides: (1) it does reduce my appetite a lot and (2) it only lasts about 9-10 hours on my current dose (12.5mg), but higher doses (25mg+) give me headaches. It's not perfect, but the positives definitely outweigh the negatives for me. Lastly-you don't know how it'll affect you, so don't let reviews scare you away if you/your doc think it might help."	9	March 21, 2021	4
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I was diagnosed with ADHD at age 17 and only really started taking stimulant medication after I had turned 20 last year. I was originally trying out varying doses of IR but started trying XR in the past few months.  Overall: Hit or miss for me. It does help with my focus, but the side effects and how much it helps varies pretty drastically depending on the day. Biggest side effects are dehydration, lack of appetite, potentially crashing at night (normal). I also feel a bit uncomfortable sometimes (anxiety-ish twitchy feeling) but that's not very common.  The mallinckrodt brand I was switched to recently seems maybe a bit more hit or miss honestly I can't really tell that much of a difference (unlike people on opioids who swear that mallinckrodt is awful). I'm on 25mg for now and I'm gonna keep seeing how I feel in the coming weeks. Helps with ADHD no doubt, but do be weary of the side effects.	7	March 16, 2021	2
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I took Mydayis 37.5 mg for 2 years. I just recently ran out and decided to wait a week to refill. I cannot believe the change in myself! While on it I became withdrawn and too focused on 1 specific thing. I cut out people and ruined my small business. I didn't feel human! I can't explain the feeling but now that I haven't taken it in a week I feel like myself again! I was just flesh living day by day on mydayis! I will NEVER touch it again! Please tell me there's others out there with similar experiences	1	March 12, 2021	5
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	"I have been taking teva 20mg adderall from 06-19 when they disappeared. I had already suffered from side effects from other generics due to CVS giving me a different generic a few times without consent or being informed. I did the whole google wormhole for a few months before finally seeing a random comment about ""INACTIVE"" ingredients and how this person suffered terrible side effects across multiple generic medications with this same ""INACTIVE"" ingredient. Being on multiple meds myself and having autoimmune and neuro disorders it affected my mental health knowing something wasn't right and just not grasping why & not understanding. That random comment changed everything for me ""INACTIVE"" does not equal no effect.  Teva not being an option then and now not at all I use Mallinckrodt and Arubindo 20 mg. I find it helps to switch them every couple months or I take M in the morning and A in the afternoon depending on how my body is functioning. I tried SAndoz that was terrible side effects."	8	March 6, 2021	2
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	My 7 year old son is a first grader and was recently diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. He has been recommended Adderall for this but I am a bit reluctant to initiate its usage. I have a few reservations about how long it lasts in our system which I have heard can prove to be dangerous for a young kid. I have read multiple articles like these, but I am still not so sure. Seeing the number of experienced people here, please tell me if I should continue with it.		March 4, 2021	4
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	First time taking Alvogen generic amphetamine with dextroamphetamine 30mg. Been taking adderall for 2 years but always Teva generic. Oh my God, the Alvogen brand has made me feel so sick. All over severe headache, nauseous, vomiting, diarrhea. I feel awful. No focus, no energy, can't keep anything down, running to the bathroom.	1	February 27, 2021	8
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Been taking adderall for years. Until the had me try a white stop sign shaped one by mallinckrodt since there was an adderall shortage at my Walgreens. mallinckrodt amphetamine/dextroamphetamine shouldn’t even be labeled as amphetamine/dextroamphetamine it should just be sold as a caffeine pill because all it does is wake you up subtlety. It doesn’t help with focus whatsoever. I’ve already filed a complaint with the FDA and recommend everyone else do the same	1	February 25, 2021	20
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I take the 10 mg amphetamine with dextroamphetamine by Teva and it works great, better than the 15 mg.in my opinion. I see others mentioning generics by Alogen and Mallinckrodt here. Well I take a couple of other medications manufactured by these 2, on and off, most times it's Mallickrodt. Let me tell you, this is the WORST drug manufacturer on the market. The Alogen is junk too. I've been on a few medical chat sites just to see what I can find out about Mallinckrodt and see if others felt the same way and they absolutely do! Literally 100's of people have complained to the co. itself and to the FDA. This has been going on for a solid 5 years at least & the stuff is STILL pure unadulterated JUNK.	7	February 21, 2021	25
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Switched from Concerta to Mydayis for the longer duration mechanism Mydayis offers. Was started on 25mg of Mydayis. ADD symptoms improved but I experienced dry mouth, dizziness, heart increase, and appetite decrease which subsided after the first week. Second week I felt like the dose was not effective. Doc switched me to 37.5mg of the mydayis and so far symptoms of ADD improved but side effects are rough. Dry mouth, headache, dizziness, lack of appetite, increased anxiety. I’m on day 4 or 5 so hoping the side effects subside when my body adjusts to the higher dose... fingers crossed.	6	February 20, 2021	4
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I am currently on Adderall XR 30MG, and it has changed so many different aspects of my life, including depression.  I was prescribed Adderall because I was about to be terminated from my job. Back to the drug, I take it around 6am everyday, and found that my overall mood has changed. I am not as emotional as I was before, yet I am still able to express my feelings when necessary without the full breakdowns. I have been dealing with Major Depressive Disorder, and this medication has alleviated most of those feelings.  However, the medication has not been a miracle drug, and it contains no magic! For me, ADD has always been there. For me, it took me to be 36 years old to finally realize it was time to visit a psychiatrist, regardless of all the negative stigmas; I was glad I did, because it gave me many suspected answers, rather than self diagnosing situations.	9	February 15, 2021	17
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’ve taken adderall for years. I used to be on Lannett brand and Walgreens recently switched to TEVA. I had my script switched from CVS to Walgreens because it was closer to me. I have been on it for 3 months and the side effects are TERRIBLE.  I clench my teeth so bad my teeth have broken, I am severely depressed, I can’t find happiness in literally anything. I don’t feel motivated at all. If anything I feel less motivated to get out of bed. My skin is dry, my eyes are sinking in and I get terrible migraines. My anxiety is so bad I’m anti social, and I thought I had a stroke because of side effects. I’m 25. Just don’t take it		February 13, 2021	7
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I take two 30 mg pills a day for ADHD and it has really made a huge difference in my life. I am able to focus on one task at a time and complete it. Works great for giving me the motivation I sometimes lack. Only issue is that when I was given the white or peach ones, they did not seem to work as well as the pink ones. Talked to doctor about it and she added to my prescription to only receive the pink ones. Curious if anyone else has had this issue	9	February 10, 2021	37
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	ALVOGEN INC has got me all messed up. I've taken ADHD meds since 1st grade and I'm 32 now so I'm very confident in my ability to distinguish between generics that work & don't and why. For the past 4 years I've used the same CVS location to fill my Adderall tab 30mg generic the past two times though I received a pill that looked different thinking okay whatever this happens from time to time it is just a different manufacturer no big deal. I was wrong. I have had insanely high blood pressure increases, trouble sleeping, hardly any focus, SEVERE anxiety like where is feel like I can't breathe suddenly especially when I try to sleep, shaky hands, VERY noticeable heart palpitations, diarrhea, headaches and  weird emotional ups & downs. I've been vegan for 3 months now at first I was seeing a steady decrease in blood pressure but as soon as I started taking this new generic I'm topping out at 161/111 at the doctor a few days ago which is just absolutely bonkers and terrifying	2	February 9, 2021	9
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’ve taken TEVA adderall 20 mg IR for the past 2+ years. It worked greatly for my ADD & as an anti-depressant. HOWEVER, it has changed! Starting July 2020, the TEVA tablet was completely different. It was no longer sweet, the consistency was harder & the efficacy was compromised. I can take it & fall asleep hours later & there is ZERO anti-depressant effect. In fact, it deepens my depression.  I will submit a report to the FDA & I encourage everyone else to. Also, please research the complaints of TEVAs other generics. I’m not sure what to try next. I tried the Sandoz and it was actually worse. I received the hideous Zydus once-which gave me a migraine & intensely aching back.I believe it’s manufactured out of this country.  This experience has made me question ALL generic medications.   Please start researching yours & refuse to take these.  I tried switching to name brands but my ins. refuses to pay.	2	February 8, 2021	11
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Have used a generic for about 6 years now worked for me except it has turned me into a teeth grinder I do it all the time and now my teeth are worn to the point they are ruined.  My doctor said he never heard of that side effect but a recent visit to a dentist to try to fix my teeth I was told they see this all the time and this grinding may never go away. I need to find something that works without these side effects	6	February 4, 2021	9
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’ve been in this medication for almost a year . And it change my life in good way.

ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been taking Teva amphetamine/dextroamphetamine (adderall generic) for quite sometime for ADHD. In the last year, I noticed right away something was off. First was the obvious color. The Teva that has always worked for me with no problems (that was being weaned out in 2019) was as follows..  peach color and sweet, easy to swallow and not gag on. Teva now, is orange. The sweet taste that made it bearable to take has changed completely. My focus, clarity, motivation, and concentration has been/is immensely effected by the new ingredient change. (I don't have it at all)  My overall mental health, has declined quickly. It has caused my mood to completely change, headaches are constant, and upset stomach. All of this, and they don't even work. I struggle everyday now. Less main ingredient and more fillers means more pills can be produced, which means more money in the manufacturer's pocket..... Mental health should be top priority, especially being consistent with and not changing the ingredients.	1	January 17, 2021	51
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	This month is the first time I received sandoz adderall ER and it doesn't seem to work very well for me. Mallinckrodt doesn't seem to work too well for me either. I think Teva seems to work the best for me; even better than the name brand for adderall.	6	January 17, 2021	2
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have suffered with ADHD since I was a young kid, I got diagnosed at the youngest age possible and I never got any help for it by my old doctor.  With my new doctor, he gave me Adderall XR to start out with 10 and than up it to 20 within a week if not effective.   I am on 20 MG now and it has changed my life, I failed school and life because I couldn't pay attention and now not only can I pay attention but this has also helped as my ADHD had caused Depression/Anxiety also OCD.	10	January 15, 2021	14
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Generic Adderall varies significantly depending on mfg. Reason being, the FDA says the mfg only has to “demonstrate” it “works in the same way “ as the brand-name. i.e. generic ingredients do  Not have to be same which is why so many don’t work and/or make people feel sick. My experience, the only generic that works like the brand-name is Prasco, which acquired Teva’s generic xr in 2016.  Few pharmacies use Prasco as their generic because it’s more expensive!  My Dr specifies “Prasco generic only” on my prescription for D-Amphetamine ER 30MG Salt combo. By law, the pharmacy must comply if Prasco is one of their overall suppliers. My insurance changed so I called Prasco to see if they sell to Costco. They do. Just takes a day or 2 for the pharmacist to order and fill my script. Walgreens used Prasco as their generic until recently. Now it’s Mallinckrodt which just filed for bankruptcy to settle a slew of opioid lawsuits. It’s all about $		January 8, 2021	60
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	The adderall name brand is 2-3 times better than generic adderall XR. The FDA should be inspecting these generic companies and make sure they are getting as high of quality ingredients. I urge anyone in generics to try real adderall for a month then decided for yourself. Decide to report the generics because we should be able to get a cheaper still 90$ for generic compared to $220+ for name brand.	10	January 7, 2021	18
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’m a doctor with ADHD. I’ve been on the generics to cut costs during tough times but I insist on the name brand adderall. No only is it smoother it lasts longer and helps even more than the generics. It’s a shame that cost is a bearing on necessary prescriptions and that generic are so much weaker and poorer quality. Generic adderall needs to step it up they have quality issues and their recipe is somehow flawed.	5	January 7, 2021	25
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I've only been taking it for 3 days but I can understand now when people say they feel it running in the background. So far no side effects other than appetite loss. I do feel energy from this but not like Adderall there's no anxiety tied to the energy its more like motivation than energy. One thing I've noticed is I like to always be doing something that is productive in some way. It's not the type of energy you get and use to dance or workout you feel driven to get things done.  It last for the whole 16 hours which surprised me I'm an ultra rapid metabolizer. I have no crash on this like I did with Adderall. I'm just waiting for my period now to see how the cramps are and giving the medicine more time to see if I do have any side effects, so far none but no appetite.	10	January 3, 2021	11
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I've been taking dextroamp-amphet ER 15mg once a day for roughly 3 months now and it's helped me greatly until 2 weeks ago and it's as if I cut my dose by 3/4! Is this normal and what dose, frequency, and type of adderall should I change to? I've heard about generic vs name brand, so what do the best ones look like?	6	December 30, 2020	1
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I've been prescribed adderall for 10yrs+ and without it mentally and physically I would be worse. I do have soreness, achy body, etc but have other health problems. Adderall has ROTTED MY TEETH OUT. Being 42 years old, fear ability to retain with out medicine as I age. I have severe withdrawal, to include extreme fatigue, severe constipation. I need the Adderral and helps some as without it life would be more difficult. All and all I would not manage without it very well but it is less effective as been taking for years. Take care and God Bless All. Be Safe!	7	December 24, 2020	10
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Regarding the post by DrKatz on 11/7/2020:.  I too take the 20 mg salt combo- manufactured by Teva, and have been on that specific brand for two and a half years.  I can definitely concur that something has changed with their product.   I am on a prescription of 80 mg a day and I too noticed a difference in taste, consistency of the pill itself, and it not working as well as it used to.  I am aware of a recall May 22nd by Teva for a few of their doses- the 20mg pill being one of them.   Thinking placebo, I inspected the pill closely: the depression level of the imprint is different, slight change in the oblong shape, the edging* (*like the cut/side profile of floor boards) and thickness + curvature.   The taste difference (bitter) I noticed in August. October back to normal but currently (Nov.) the taste changed again- however this time with a much greater chemical profile- like bactine or rubbing alcohol, more crumbly and not working as well for either my ADHD or narcolepsy.	8	November 15, 2020	29
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’ve been on Adderall XR 20 mg since October 6th 2020. I have to say this medication is life changing and your psychiatrist, doctor or whatever will try and find the right dosage for you. I’m 22 years old, Male and I noticed the medication working within an hour, I’m about 220 pounds 5’8 and despite that it still kicked in relatively fast. The side affects I notice the most are as follows dry mouth, appetite suppression, some irritability, and insomnia on occasion. Adderall XR for me last anywhere from 8-12 hours, if it wears off the medical professional in most cases will add Adderall IR to take in the afternoon, since upping the dose of XR will not increase duration only the intensity of the medication itself. ADHD medication is all about finding what’s right for YOU, don’t give up if it doesn’t get manageable or fixed after the first try.	9	November 8, 2020	42
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have always used Teva Adderall IR because I have had horrible experiences with other generic, including inconsistency and lack of potency.  Understand that I have taken Teva Adderall 20MG tablets over five years, thus it would less difficult for someone like me to detect subtle changes in its effects.  I have noticed the following, and this started around September 2020.  Teva generic Adderall tablets seem (and this is very subtle) smaller in size. Second: Teva is known for its slight sweet taste. It is almost as if that is completely  gone... I’m certainly not saying that added anything to it, but I’m saying it’s an indicator  of some sort of formula change.  Finally, although the 20MG tablet is small, it used to be easy to half the tablet. Recently they just crumble. To summarize, I have also noted a very marked decrease in efficacy.	7	November 7, 2020	26
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Adderall XR is Life changing (positively). I went from being massively distractable and procrastinate constantly to getting things done. I'm not just referring to school work or office work. I mean just showing up on time to meet up with friends. Not getting instantly bored with family.  I truly love it!   --- Quick warning, take it as your doctor recommends! So much of the bad press comes from people abusing the drug.  Likewise, if you're able, take a day off now and then. Perhaps on days when you don't need to work or do much. It's sort of like coffee/tea/caffeine in that sense. Fine if you do take it everyday, but probably best if you give your mind/body a rest from it now & then.  Just like running or exercise, you need light or rest days each week to really get the most from the workout.	10	November 6, 2020	34
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	My grades instantly went from the 60s and 70s to 90s and 100s and for once I felt like I had control over my life. The side effects were pretty bad and inconsistent though, so I had to go from 20 to 15 mg.	9	November 4, 2020	18
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	The Adderal dose my doctor prescribed didn't seem to work that great(20 mg twice a day)  One day I had it after my oatmeal and it was more effective so after that I just scrunched up the pill like I did with oatmeal, but I didn't put it on anything.  I just took it like that. Works great!  Much more motivation to get tasks done so I can finish more!  Maybe you could try that if it sees not enough to work.  I use Sandoz.	10	October 11, 2020	20
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Adderall XR was originally prescribed to me for ADD, but it worked best as a terrific antidepressant.  However, now that I've been on it for 20 straight years at 40-80 mg. Daily, it has very little antidepressant effect now. It's Adderall burnout -- apparently it strips the brain of dopamine -- the feel-good hormone.        I still have to take it just to do anything at all each day.  The worst effect is insomnia -- no matter how early I take it.  It keeps me up for 24 hours unless I finally have to take Seroquel for sleep.  Seroquel is the only thing that will knock out Adderall XR.  But I hate it because it makes me so damn sluggish in the morning, awful.        I cannot believe it's 2020, and there is still no decent antidep medication available,	8	October 1, 2020	31
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	The last 9 months generic “Zydus” was the only brand of amphetamine/dextroamphetamine available in my area. I noticed pretty nasty side effects beginning 45 minutes after consumption. I’ve never felt depression so severely before taking Zydus. Teva/Barr has returned. Felt a night and day difference the first day. Hope Zydus gets banned for the safety of us all.	1	September 23, 2020	20

ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I switched over to Mydayis in hope of finding something that could last the entire day. My days are usually nonstop for approx 16 hours. I started at the lowest dose and went up to the 50mg after 3 weeks. Gave it a few more weeks in hopes that it would work like how we wanted it to. The negative side effects outweigh the positives. The first thing I noticed was ejaculatory anhedonia. It led to an unplanned pregnancy before I caught it. The rest included falling behind in classes and not being able to keep up at work. Felt lazy and not wanting to do anything. It was like being unmedicated all over again!	4	September 21, 2020	8
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Generic Adderall:  TEVA vs. ALVOGEN “All generic adderall is NOT the same trust me!...... I don’t care what your physician or pharmacist may say.“  I’ve taken Adderall for nearly 25 plus years for ADD.  WHY? it works twice as good ask anyone whose taken different brands before. For the BEST quality and most potent adderall on the market is made by a company called TEVA.  Even pharmacist tell me when they run out of TEVA and must use ALVOGEN their patients complain because the pharmacies cannot keep TEVA in stock because the consumers know it’s the best and most effective for ADD and ADHD.	1	September 15, 2020	133
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have taken both Adderall and its generic(amphetamine/dextroamphetamine) for over 16 years for my Adult Attention Deficit Disorder. I have found that the original Adderall has the best effectiveness and in these last 4 tears Teva [still oval, peach/orange color] working the best for my A.D.D. Pills made by Mallinkrodt I only get by mistake, and still act like a placebo in May 2020. Dose: 20mg. X 2 daily.		August 25, 2020	24
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I do not like this formula. I have been on various generics for years and did not feel like this 10 mg did anything. Unfortunately, I've already filled this prescription and am stuck with this medication.	1	August 24, 2020	7
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been taking Adderall for most of my adult life and Walgreens always carried the generic version that worked best for me but recently they changed who they get it from now and the new amphetamine / dextroamphetamine from Lannett MFG SUCK!  They do not work at all - actually the worst next to the  YELLOW ROUND Mp 447's, PINK ROUND Cor 136's, or OCTAGON WHITE ONES.   The TEVA amphetamine/dextroamphetamine Peach Oval B 974's are the ones that work best for me and now I don' t know how to get them - Help..	10	June 16, 2020	94
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	My concern in taking generic Adderall IR for several years is the effect is has on my heart  When I take it, at the prescribed dose,  I most always have sinus tachycardia  (a heart rate above 100 beats per minute)  I also have noticed that it effects bladder emptying....and my urinary stream seems slower (and I am fairly young) and I am not usually able to completely empty my bladder.	6	June 10, 2020	26
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Since the shortage for about 3 months I've been taking generic Zydus 20mg. How do these drugs pass inspection? I think a couple pixie sticks would work better. I wonder if generic adderall from any manufacturer will ever get better. I think charging over $5.00 for this rubbish should be criminal.	1	June 7, 2020	40
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	This medication amphetamine/dextroamphetamine has made me feel VERY JITTERY and sick to my stomach! I take generic TEVA brand orange tab 30 mg. The pharmacy didn’t have any of the TEVA brand so they gave me generic U31 tablet - Aurolife Pharma, LLC brand. This is horrible! People take time off work to be seen by doctor, get put on meds for a reason, spend money for the appointment and meds, all the time you spend doing this & it can’t be returned back to Walmart to get my right medicine because “it’s against the law” supposedly! Even when I have the entire prescription (minus one) to give them back. Why make people feel like this when they do so much to try and make life easier being on their meds. I don’t have insurance so my doc visit is almost $100 & medicine is around $60 every month. My 7 year old daughters meds were switched as well. I’m scared to even give her medicine! How can Walmart just give you a different brand that you’ve never taken and not tell me before I leave it’s different!?	1	June 5, 2020	67
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I am a male in my thirties. Adderall is the third drug I tried to tread ADHD after doing trials on Vyvanse and Concerta. Vyvanse worked but did not last long enough and I had bad crashing (headache, exhaustion). Concerta did not work for me at all, made me lethargic and even more distracted.  Adderall at 20mg a day gives me energy to focus on work and my kids. It lasts me until sometime in the evening. I have trouble sleeping some nights on it, other than that the side effects are negligible.	8	May 3, 2020	43
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Activist Dextramp-amphet ER (30 mg.) [ generic for Adderall ]  is HORRIBLE. NOT effective. Causes nausea. HORRIBLE. I have taken this drug for over 3 years and I know what it is supposed to do.	1	April 30, 2020	40
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Adderall is very useful but recently I was ignorant and thought it would be okay to take a little extra at night to help clean my house. I took a bigger extra dose then I should have and a few hours later I felt pretty awful. I am very productive and more positive on the right dose of this med, so I recommend trying it or Desoxyn, because it is said to have fewer side effects like anxiety and panic and irritability post dose. Like all meds, Adderall is a blessing when dosed right and a curse when dosed incorrectly. I noticed that I paced around a bit when on it but I didn’t feel that anxious. It isn’t fun and enjoyable to take a big dose, don’t do it. God made everything to be used in moderation and it is much better for the whole society when we obey the wise instructions of our doctors and leaders. Be careful, obey your doctor, and may God bless you all to succeed in your treatment plans and in your lives. Amen	8	March 18, 2020	74

ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Recently changed pharmacies and didn't realize that there can be quite a difference between generics. For 4 years I’ve taken adderall 2x day, 10 mg. Never any problems until I switched pharmacies to save $.  Elite Pharma is who makes this new one and it is NOT GOOD.   I am lethargic, unable to focus, quite sleepy.  It’s as if I haven’t even taken anything.  Incredibly frustrating as I am not even half way through this months supply.	1	March 7, 2020	50
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	The generic manufacturer of amphetamine & dextroamphetamine, Sandoz, is the only one that works for me. This month the manufacturer is Northstar and last month Aurobindo, and they are garbage. They don’t help AT ALL with my focus. Zero.  I am irritable. I am getting nothing done and my anxiety is sky high. I am going to stop taking these brands and ask pharmacy for Sandoz.  I complained to the FDA and urge others to do so as well. This is ridiculous.	1	March 3, 2020	70
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Adderall has worked great for me when taken as needed. When I was in my early 20’s and taking it daily I built up a dependence that lead to terrible withdrawals as it is very addictive. (Learned the hard way and never want to go through that again!)  I will usually only take this when my ADHD symptoms are unbearable and my work/personal life starts to become affected. We are talking maybe 1-4 tablets max per month.  It really does help with focus and energy, and I find that one 10-20mg dose is usually enough and I feel good for several days after the dose without any withdrawals or dependence issues.

ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Laura, CVS in Kansas City and probably elsewhere exclusively carry SANDOZ. With goodrx my 60 tablets of 20mg are 28$	9	February 22, 2020	32
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	If you're taking for ADHD please note there are a lot of side effects, having said this, they are sometimes serious so take note to talk to your doctor. If you get cold fingers or toes, make sure to consult your doctor as it's a syndrome that can be prevented.  It does help with focus, it helps with impulse control, it helps with a general overall euphoric feeling and it can cause you to lose a lot of weight. Be sure to eat, EAT, don't shake your head, you know I'm talking to you. Eat and stay hydrated it causes you to urinate a LOT, make sure to supplement what you are losing. It will cause tremors, shakes, and irritability, again, eat food. Make sure to stick to a 2000 calorie diet AT LEAST. May cause muscle fatigue and extreme soreness, stay hydrated, make sure of this.  Some say it causes better grades in school, well, to an extent. It just makes you write a lot. Eat Eat Hydrate And maybe take melatonin to help promote rest. I warned and entertained you.	7	February 21, 2020	97
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	My daughter developed tardive dyskinesia, a permanent drug-induced movement disorder, while on Adderall. If your kid has ODD, stay away from all stimulates; they are most at-risk.	1	February 19, 2020	26
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I totally agree that the new A 79 generics are no good.  I mean they work a little bit, but I feel taking the same amount of the other oblong orange ones that taste like sweet we’re way better.  These taste like nasty chalk.    I’ve never had adderal brand though so I wouldn’t that difference.	3	February 19, 2020	25
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been on  adderal 15mg 2×daily  for 7 yrs it has completely change my life.  I  was always down, depressed, unmotivated, impulsive, always day dreaming, short attention span, no focus and couldn't sitting still. Adderal has given me a new happy life that I can enjoy and appreciate. Starting to think I need to go up to 20mg. I can feel I'm getting used to them. But without them I wouldn't get out of bed and would waste my life.I  think adderal is my miracle drug I have never been so grateful for a prescription drug	10	February 17, 2020	111
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I was diagnosed with ADHD combined type and have tried Ritalin and Focalin. Both weren't that great for me so my doctor prescribed me 10 mg of Adderall XR. Adderall has made me have better multitasking skills and helped me pay attention. It hasn't really helped with being hyper or being impulsive and has given me bad twitching eyes. It also has made my sleep schedule weird so watch out for that.	6	February 6, 2020	23
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Picked up amphetamine with dextroamphetamine medicine 1/24/20, bottle said Barr brand? But Teva tabs were inside. Teva bought Barr in 07. Before Teva bought out multiple companies and started using their ingredients within the last 2-3 years, they were great. Sandoz and Corepharma have been the only other decent makers, before they were bought out. I haven’t noticed a thing from picking these up 1/24. The worst medicine I’ve had from Teva in 8 years.	1	February 4, 2020	36
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	On 1/24/2020 I received Teva generic IR Adderall like I usually have for the last 7 years off and on (used to be good.) Except Barr was labeled on the bottle for the first time ever. Not sure why since Teva bought Barr in 07. Regardless it isn’t any better, by far the worst I’ve had of Teva. But every other company is pathetic. Brand works 10X better but 10X pricier. If the FDA enforced the rule of not less than 80% and no more than 125% concentrated effectiveness, that would be a first! The right MG of each dose might be regulated, but the fillers/inactive ingredients added is the big issue. 1-3 used to be in the old Barr/ Shire/ Sandoz/ Core and those worked fantastic. Every generic now has 5-8 fillers that make it less effective but also cause severe side effects. FDA could care less about small market drugs.	1	February 3, 2020	50
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Game changer. First DX by A pdoc: ADHD. What, no?  Yes.  I felt like I was only working with one puzzle piece and finding out about ADHD was like being given the other 999 pieces. At first Adderall IR didn’t seem to do much but I slowly realized it was like putting emotional and mental blinders on where I could see the rest of the world but mainly focus on the task at hand. Job saver for sure.  Since I have a high tolerance to meds XR saved me from constantly trying to remember to take next dose when I started crashing. Tops.	10	February 3, 2020	30
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have found the generic brand for Adderall is not effective as the brand name. The Epic brand caused me to have severe depression, blurred vision, headaches, very tired and no focus at all.  I’m trying to find a brand that is much like the name brand. Looking for suggestions if anyone can share please. Thanks	1	January 29, 2020	97
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I went to pharmacy to pick up my Adderall generic brand Zydus. I was told they was out of my brand. I was given the Epic brand. The Epic brand caused me to have severe depression and I stayed in bed, I’ve always been very energetic. I stopped taking it. I called the Pharmacist and reported the side effects I had. Pharmacist didn’t act surprised at all, stated we are out of your regular brand and probably won’t get it back in.	1	January 28, 2020	18
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Generics make me feel ill, sometimes headache, sometimes itching or hives.  Google where generics are made.	1	January 24, 2020	45
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	"I was so glad to see these posts.  Pharmacies are so rude to me. I switched to so many brands, but they say they are all alike, and say it doesn't matter which generic I get, because they're all the same.  My doctor, unfortunately, thinks the same.  I finally said to the pharmacy tech one day, ""I'm sure I'm not the only one, who would like certain generics."" She said, no, I'm the only one. I know this sounds crazy, but the blue 10mg of teva, don't seem to work like the 15mg of the peach teva, even if I cut one of the blue in half to make it 15mg."	8	January 23, 2020	92
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I was taking 15mg of generic Adderall  amphetamine / dextroamphetamine  for 3 months and by the end of the 3rd month I had 3 separate people tell me I didn't seem myself. I'm a regularly joyful and excited person but every emotion I had felt muted or stunted while on amphetamine/dextroamphetamine. I stopped talking it and 3 days later felt so much better. I was joyful again! Back to pinging all over the place but at least I'm happy doing it lol. I'm trying Concerta next.	4	January 21, 2020	3
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Ok so I have Both Narcolepsy/Extreme Fatigue & ADD. The generic forms of Adderall (amphetamine and dextroamphetamine) seem to be getting worse and worse. They are making them with obviously cheaper so-called similar ingredients but the new generic amphetamine and dextroamphetamine drugs just have bad side effects and don’t work for me at all or are far less effective. I don’t know if it is Teva brand that is making these cheap ineffective knock-offs that cause migraines & other side effects but they are definitely not working or decent. The generic form Amphetamine Salts works just fine for me but again I think when Teva took over and apparently used far cheaper Ingres there is definitely a disconnect because I don’t think Dextroamp-Amphetamin is a worthy generic form of Adderall but maybe just because Teva brand seems to be using incredibly cheap ingredients,	10	January 20, 2020	21
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I've had ONE DOSE.  Let me be clear.  I took one 25mg pill 6 hours ago and I'm so sleepy I can't see straight.  I slept 7.5 hours last night so I don't understand the drowsiness.	5	January 9, 2020	33
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’ve been on adderall for a few years now and it was life changing. I’ve always been prescribed a generic and have never had a problem until recently. I noticed that I was not getting the same benefit as I was previously and for months, tried to convince myself that it was in my head and then one month, I noticed everyday that I felt great! Looked at the pill imprint and what do you know - it was a different manufacture (Amneal) than the one I was taking. I started googling it and saw a lot of complaints for generic Adderall from Global Pharmaceutical. I’m talking to pharmacist today about it and requesting the generic by Amneal Pharmaceuticals. I thought they were all the same and it’s a shame that global can make these any less effective than what they should be. Is it so people go to their dr, say they don’t feel the effects of it and get an increase? Sounds like a big pharma thing to do. Trust your gut instinct because you’re the person who knows you best.	1	January 8, 2020	17
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	"I recently was given this new form of adderall from the pharmacy which was circular with just an ""A"" on one side... I did not like this new form of Adderall at all!! I assumed it would have the same effect as the typical oval shaped and it was completely different which is a little scary. It was very bitter and gross tasting unlike the football shaped one has a sweet note. It also disintegrated turning to powder immediately, as I attempted to break it in half (waste of product). I did not get any focus from it nor did I feel any different at all?? It did nothing! Then the next day got a horrible headache! I was talking with a friend who also mentioned getting the same thing recently. He mentioned having an extremely bad headache too the following day, so we now know it's from this form of adderall. I DO NOT LIKE IT. It should be pulled from the market honestly I don't know what the heck this rubbish  is but it is not adderall."	2	January 2, 2020	79
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Was first diagnosed with ADD(inattentive type) by multiple doctors at 18 years old. Out of the gate they prescribed me 60mg IR amphetamine with dextroamphetamine. I am now 26, taking 80mg/day, and have learned a substantial amount about this drug. No it won't make you any smarter or develop hidden talents, most believe this. The generic (dextroamphetamine-amphetamine IR) is cheaper than its brand (Adderall xr.) Obviously brand is set to higher standards of quality than generics, so yes brand name anything works better than generics, it's common sense. If you use it correctly and find the right manufacturer like Teva, you most likely won't find as many negatives as most people.	8	December 30, 2019	9
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’ve been taking the generic version of Adderall for about 2 years now. I was tired all the time and couldn’t focus. I felt like a slug and when I had energy I still had brain fog, and had a hard time studying. In class, I would fidget in my chair, doodle, and listen to lectures, but nothing would stick in my head. No matter how long I studied.  I was prescribed the 7.5 mg tablet once a day and just the small dose did wonders for my energy levels and let me focus and actually get things done. It helped me talk in social situations and gave me a mood boost.  That being said, The generics changed a couple times. And I’m not sure, but I think I can tell a difference between them. After the pill wears off, my head aches, my legs throb, my body aches, and I’m nauseous and feel sick. I have flu like symptoms, which are miserable. It’s sad because it’s a really small dose and helps me so much but some of the side effects suck. You just gotta see what’s worth it to you.	8	December 24, 2019	61
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	This medication does not work at all now.	1	December 2, 2019	49
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Not very effective; I took a  double dose which cause headaches and made me generally feel ill.  There are  better generics. Company should not be allowed to sell this medication.	1	November 17, 2019	13
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been on Adderal 10 mg for three months now. I have found it helps me so much in the morning. I need to talk to my doctor and see if I can get something for the afternoon. It's been a godsend but I don't have any anger issues just a lot of anxiety. I'm on Xanax as well three times a day and Ambien for sleep which really helps bed by 5 clock I'm wore out. And then my symptoms seem to return. I would recommend this to anyone that has concentration issues. I'm 41 years old and when I went to school they always called you slow. Which always made you look bad. I think my doctor he's wonderful and I'm going to get my Xanax upped and see if I can get something for the afternoon due to that I work many hours a day and I have to be on my toes.	9	November 2, 2019	6
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I got diagnosed with ADHD at the beginning of this school year, being my senior year of high school. Since 8th grade, I've struggled in school, been incredibly impulsive, had very strange eating habits, over-thought everything, and could never contain my anger or anxiety. Once prescribed, my life has changed. My grades went up, and in 3 months I've lost almost 30 pounds (I am still in the normal BMI range). I can control myself. I finally believe in myself because of Adderall.	9	October 29, 2019	80
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Well been on and off Adderall or Ritalin since I was 5. I'm 62 now, and take 60mg XR morning and two 30mg IR in the afternoon. For me it's a Godsend. I can pay attention now,  I'm more sociable, I'm just.......me.	8	October 23, 2019	22
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’m 48 yo woman that was diagnosed with ADHD in elementary.  When I began (on holiday) taking it I’m extremely fatigue/zombie the first 3 days, I am not nearly as engaged with anyone/anything around me (I talk 97% less when I’m on Adderall) and it makes me feel less cognitive.  I feel like it dumbs me down.  After the 3rd day I start to feel better and those “tranquilizer effects” go away. Adderall is an emotional regulator for me. It works wonders for my impulsivity, racing thoughts, fidgeting, feeling overwhelmed, anger, anxiety, zoning out, and my mouth. Yes, my mouth has always been my biggest challenge and has caused me tremendous social/professional problems.  While in a perfect world I’d be on no medication, I have to recommend Adderall for anyone whose suffering from ADHD, because  it has changed my overall quality of life for the best.  Sparkle on beautiful people! 	9	October 23, 2019	81
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I was diagnosed with both bipolar and ADHD. After trying multiple combinations, we finally tried adderall on top of Wellbutrin, Lamictal, and Fluvoxamine for OCD. At first, the adderall did wonders. Completely made me enjoy life again. However, as my tolerance increased, the adderall crash was very intense. It resulted in a bipolar low almost everyday around the same time. I recently just switched to Stratetta and is my second day taking it. Anxious to see how this works.	9	October 22, 2019	29
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’ve been taking meds for ADHD/ADD close to 8 years now.  Tried Adderall at many dosages, types and amount of times per day over a period of many years.  My biggest issue. I forgot to take them.  Tried Vyvanse. It helped but I got nauseous, dizzy every day.  Tried Adderall again and forgot to take them.  One day my doctor mentioned Mydayis. I wouldn’t have to remember taking more than one in the AM.  After a week I could tell that it was helpful but wasn’t able to tell if a BIG difference.  I ran out due to scheduling once & my brain went into hyper drive. I hadn’t felt that chaotic for awhile.  WHILE talking to my doctor she legit wrote out the prescription, handed it to me. ‘go fill it NOW.’ Even had others asking how long I would be without it.  It was clear it helped at that point.  I don’t notice any side effects.  My results with Mydayis are pretty good. No worries of forgetting it, which was the major factor in my switch.	8	October 20, 2019	11
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I'm making this review one year after trying Mydayis for only a week. I switched to this drug from Adderall IR 20's BID to the 37mg capsule, you don't really think your buzzing, but you indeed are, and more so than with Adderall for the same dose. What prompted me to write this review was that I noticed someone else who reviewed this mentioned that they would be returning the bottle to the pharmacy because they didn't want insurance to think they were keeping it. This is an effect of the drug, I too, even though I bought it on the $5 coupon, did not want the pharmacy (who does not care) to think that I wanted to keep this drug so I returned the remaining 23 capsules to them. It works well, puts you in a different state of mind, and doesn't provide the sense well being of some other ADHD products offer, but it does work better than some generics. Perhaps give this a try if you're on generics that don't work. It is pretty strong, but doesn't feel like it. if that makes sense.	7	October 14, 2019	12
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I was on 10MG XR for 3 months and it worked amazingly. This is a very good medication if you have trouble functioning like a normal person, although be prepared for really dark thoughts if you decide to stop taking it. Withdrawal from this drug is no joke, it can make you want to die...but if you keep taking it or taper off slowly you should be fine.		October 12, 2019	22
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I was diagnosed with ADD in 2005 after experiencing horrible distractibility in class while at college and not being able to focus on a single thought in my head.  I was prescribed Adderall IR and I remember feeling like I had drunk 5 Red Bulls or something!  My heart was pounding and I had horrible anxiety the whole day.  I only took it one time.  I decided to get off it immediately.  Soon after, I was prescribed Strattera, which didn't do ANYTHING.  I've gone for about 13 years without actual ADD medications because I really hated the idea of stimulants.  That all changed when I realized my ADD was getting out of control.  I saw my current psychiatrist last week who re-diagnosed me and we discussed my experiences.  I had read reviews from people here who say that Dexedrine works for them if Adderall made them too wired, so I asked if I could try that.  I just tried it today and I had no horrible side effects - no anxiety, no heart palpitations, no edginess, etc.  It is wonderful!	1	October 9, 2019	21
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have suffered my entire life with ADD.  For a while Adderal helped. Then as I turned 49 it seemed to make me more anxious, irritable,  short tempered, and I had No patience for stupidity! Upon trying the Mydayis,  I was immediately impressed. I was finishing projects.  Getting things done right! Able to focus for longer durations of time. Long enough to complete tasks at hand. I feel so much better.	10	October 3, 2019	30
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I will never give this to my child again!, I know all children are different but I'm sticking with Dyanavel XR. While he was on Adderall he was acting angry and violent, like he was on some kind of illegal drug, his facial expressions were intense, and he could not sit still, and was very emotional. so I have to give this a 1 star on my personal experience and my son's	1	October 2, 2019	35
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I've had a prescription for amphetamine with dextroamphetamine for  four years, and Teva used to work fairly well for me. Over the last year or so, it's become awful. I know it isn't me, because I still have old (2-3 years) pills laying around; I tried some of them and they work just fine.   Teva changed something in the manufacturing process. The new pills do almost nothing beneficial (I feel sleepy all day), but they have a ton of side effects. I feel very jittery, my stomach hurts, and I've been experiencing bloating.	1	September 30, 2019	23
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Overall, 20 mg Adderall XR for ADHD helps me to focus. The problem with adderall is it makes me sweat something awful. Anyone else annoyed with sweating while taking adderall?	9	September 28, 2019	62
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Well first off. Adderall is an Amphetamine  which assist with the production of dopamine. Very close  relation to meth. I am 21 years old and I started Adderall again. Previously I was on Adderall from age 8-13 and it worked great. Some say ADHD is not real and it just a symptom of bad health etc... I have been very very healthy and unhealthy which produced no changed in brain fog. Now that engineering is my main task in like I seem to have a hefty amount of brain fog. Adderall does in fact help with focus but the downside is the extreme crashes that happen when you stop taking it.	8	September 26, 2019	20
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been on Adderall for quite sometime. It has helped me focus and also being proactive. I recently got a new script and diff manufacturing teva  I noticed since I have taken it I'm extremely tired. Cannot focus at all I feel like a scatter brain..I had to call my dr to have him rewrite a new script and surrender the Teva (amphetamine with dextroamphetamine) Did anyone get the same reaction?	1	September 26, 2019	20
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I shared my experience recently on here and was going back over and reading others as well.  I believe we should all state the laboratory that producing the specific generic we are each taking. Doing so may help us all narrow down which ones to stay away from and which ones are truly therapeutic.  Eon lab  brand of amphetamine/dextroamphetamine was good until 9 months ago, now they are horrible (no therapeutic value and bad side effects).  I then I switched to Teva and they were decent for about 2 months and now they are giving me side effects.  Plus the pharmacy ran out of them and I had to wait for a new batch and when the new batch came in is when the bad side effect started.  I KNOW the drug manufacturer has changed something.  Hope that helps someone.	2	September 24, 2019	122
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	So, I have had ADHD since I was like young. I never liked the pills they gave me when I was younger because I was already a thin kid and then taking Adderall I would eat even less. So I stopped taking the medication. When I was taking this medication I got most improved student! I went without the drug for years, until just about 2 years ago I started taking it again and It has helped me so much! I am very thankful for this drug. I suffer from fatigue , and many, many other problems. This drug is one of many I NEED, To Think Straight and to not get outta control.  It also helps me BIG TIME with my anger issues. Hope this helps someone! Star Kid Is OUT!	9	September 11, 2019	47
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	This drug is one of the greatest formulas of all time. I went from down and depressed and unmotivated to organized and focused. Also from relatively poor to rich due the effect it had on me with my enthusiasm for work	10	September 11, 2019	57
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I cannot believe that the FDA allows AUROBINDO or TEVA to sale their lousy drugs through pharmacies in the US.  Neither of these generics have any affect on me at all!!  WASTE of money!   They are playing with people's minds and well being!!!!	2	September 6, 2019	110
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Have taken Adderall on and off for around 13 years for ADD and CFS. I was lucky enough to have tried the “real” brand Adderall by Barr laboratories. I’ve never taken over 20mg a day. This medicine has gone to TRASH.The only negative side affect from the Barr version was occasional jaw clinching.   I think Teva must’ve burned the patent formula or something because it has never worked liked the Barr, not even close.  So many negative side effects (migraine headaches, heartburn, nausea)! I keep hoping at some point they might magically start producing a decent version that actually helps instead of hurts.  The original Barr had true therapeutic value.  Eon labs produced a decent generic for a while, but BAM, it suddenly went to garbage at the end of 2018.  So switched back to Teva a couple months back and it started ok( not as good as Eon but better than everything else out there), then last months refill is feeling like they’re changing to something bad too.  Bring back real Adderall!	3	September 4, 2019	78
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I had taken Adderall for many years and was slowly on the decline.  I was deeply depressed and had an absolute hopeless and helpless outlook on life with no relief. I had psychosis, delusions and impulsive behavior which I never had. I began having issues with memory, thinking, reasoning, decision making, tasks, and  concentration.  I would become very agitated if being interrupted. I was very aggressive and agitated constantly, it was at least 98% of the time in 10 years.  I read horror stories about stimulants, namely the Amphetamine line of them. I subsequently tapered off of them and feel 100% better than before. I have no depressive symptoms, delusions, memory problems, agitation or aggressiveness. I was not happy with life and my personal relationships were very toxic. I wasted almost 10 years of my life feeling like this and have other personal complications that resulted from the use of these toxic drugs.	1	August 28, 2019	29

ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Works well for my adult ADHD. It gets me motivated, and I can feel it kicking in. The perfect dosage for me is the 15mg tablet, morning, and another 15mg after lunchtime! I score the 30mg tablet in half.	9	August 22, 2019	6
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I've had ADHD since I was a kid and after a couple of years taking Ritalin I stopped and then tried it again once in my 20's and again in my 30's but never liked the way it made me feel. Starting in my late 30's I started to suffer from chronic fatigue syndrome which doesn't mix well with ADHD. It puts the body and mind in a bad place. I finally got around to going to the doctor and he recommended that I take Adderall 3 times a day. This has been such a benefit to my life. Not only do I have the energy to get out of bed I can now focus enough to get some daily life stuff done.	10	August 13, 2019	9
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	First prescribed it in grad school for ADD & depression. Worked wonders. Only downside is I became very reliant on it. Was stuck between the two evils of being a depressed zombie (w/o taking it) and feeling like a happy, motivated, focused person (on Adderall). Eventually stopped taking and failed out of grad school. Work was hard, always late, made stupid mistakes, & couldn’t complete tasks. 3 years & 3 jobs later, I broke down and went back to a doctor who rediagnosed me with ADD, Anxiety, & Depression. I was reluctant to start back on Adderall and tried a few alternatives first. Everything made me feel even MORE exhausted; back on Adderall 30mg day; feel normal again. I have the motivation, energy, & focus to complete tasks. Only complaint is anxiety which I resolve w/ a low benzo & exercise. Remember, there’s no reason to be miserable if there’s a pill out there that can change your life.	7	August 10, 2019	103
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	"I've finally found it. - Mydayis it is that little reminder I never had; the missing piece of my conscience that was never there before to tell me ""stop mucking and go do the stuff you should be getting on with"""	7	August 5, 2019	31
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	This medicine initially seemed to work very well for me with improved concentration but after taking it for only 6 months I discontinued it due to anxiety levels being through the roof to the point where I couldn’t function. This was enhanced during social interactions of which is ironic because I know many people say they experience increased desire for social activities. A month after stopping medicine, I started experience psychotic symptoms of which have not subsided. I do not suggest this medicine.	4	August 3, 2019	18
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I'm 19. I've tryed a lot of ADHD medication (I'm from Canada so I have less option than the US). Concerta, Biphentin, Vyvanse. With all these medication I've experienced sides effects, or, in the case of Vyvanse, I was not focused enough. And now I'm on Adderall XR and I can tell you than is the best ADHD medication I've tried. I feel like I can multi-task like Vyvanse but more focus, and this focus make all the difference. I don't feel a lot of sides effects, and they are nothing if I compare with Concerta or Biphentin. and Adderall XR is one of the only ADHD medication with generic availability in Canada!	9	August 2, 2019	23
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Adderall X R 30mg in the morning along with 5mg of Adderall in the early afternoon seem to help my mood and condition dramatically. If you are ADHD I recommend talking with your psychiatrist.	10	August 2, 2019	24
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Started off with  Adderall  5 mg IR twice daily.  Overall, this is a very low dose.  I have found it was more effective and safer to take it every couple of days.  At least for me.  I have tried 40mg and 60mg before so I am very aware of how intense it can be.  If you take it every day you will end up increasing the dosage.  Try to use it sparingly and try doing activities that produce dopamine naturally like exercise or walking and listening to music.  This will help you feel healthier while taking it.  Overall I think it is helpful but definitely feels unnatural and can't believe they give speed to children.  	5	July 30, 2019	35
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I asked my doctor about Mydayis because it lasts 16 hours.    The first week I was so calm, never been so calm in my life, even with antidepressants. I was able to focus during conversations. I organized my desk (a little). Cleaned my car out (a little). My second week i was still focusing but I couldn't eat. I was repulsed by anything other than fruits, vegetables, cereal. But then I felt dizzy...sick to my stomach. My eyes seem to move involuntarily   Nystagmus )mand I got the worst eye strain I've ever had. My neck muscles felt extremely tight and I just kept massaging my neck trying not to panic. I tried to tough it out for the next 2 days but could not. It's been day 2 days since I quit taking it and my eyes are still involuntarily moving a little. I had big hopes for this med but this is how it worked it for me and I was only taking 12.5 mg.  I just needed to let everyone know about this possibility because I couldn't find any info about it. It would probably be considered a tic.	3	July 27, 2019	28
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Diagnosed ADD 18 y/o, on and off Adderall IR since then. Too high a dose causes psychosis...be forewarned. I used to be on 30mg 3x/day, now I'm leary of taking more than 2.5mg 2x/day. Maybe it builds up in the brain, so be sure to take breaks from it often. I notice the side effects outweigh the benefits at higher doses....irritability, zombie-like come-down. My insurance only covers this and Ritalin, so I'm stuck with bad side-effects.	4	July 23, 2019	19
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	"Adderall is literally the only THING Period that I have tried that has improved my life in the slightest (I have ADD/Treatment-Resistant Depression ) - I got my Bachelors degree in Health & Psychology, I tried EVERY supplement herb, nootropic, etc. I'm commenting here is because of all the people saying how it drained them, or over time began making them feel worse - you need to educate yourself - one of the most important being, be SURE to be supplementing with TYROSINE, literally daily (tyrosine converts into Dopamine - like how 5-HTP converts to Serotonin) just like how SSRI's eventually ""poop out"" and just stop working (because they've used up the bodies natural serotonin) Adderall will eventually ""poop out"" on you, stop working, yet even worse when this happens, the more you take the WORSE you feel because its like revving an engine with no gasoline left in it!!! Theres plenty more to look into but even just taking Tyrosine makes a HUGE difference!"	8	July 19, 2019	97
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Adderall is all fun and games until you become addicted and try to stop taking it. I loved and still love Adderall, just like all of the positive reviews here - it works like nothing else, but I will never take it again.  I quit Adderall June of 2018 and it was the worst thing I ever went through - everything you read online about stimulant withdrawal is true x100. It’s almost impossible to successfully wean off of this medication. I went cold turkey 3x before I was finally successful.  It took me months to feel “normal” again.  During this time my life went downhill and I started up again December 2018 at a low dose, which before I knew it increased back to me 40mg dose.  I just quit Adderall again because I will be trying to get pregnant at the end of this year and it was once again a battle but I managed to do it. I will NEVER go back on this medication. Ever. It took me 2 hard lessons to realize how bad this medication is for you and your brain.	1	July 17, 2019	3
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I do not recommend anyone taking Adderall. I was unable to eat or sleep while taking this medication. It caused severe stunting of my growth.	1	July 17, 2019	8
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	"I have always known that I had ADD. However, I was in grad school, and I was studying for up to 10-12 hours a day. I found myself reading and re-reading and was having a hard time retaining information, because I couldn't stay focused. I would study for hours. Long story short, for my master's degree, I had to take practice timed test for NP boards, I failed it. My instructor told me to get tested for ADHD,  and get on medications. I did, and it was the best thing I have ever done, and wish I did it sooner, it cut my studying by half, because I'm very focused. I didn't have to request extra time for my NP boards, and I passed with time to spare. I have no side effects; incr. HR, BP, I eat and exercise, and don't take it late in afternoon to avoid insomnia. I only take it when I study and not everyday.  I believe it's about making the drug work for you and not let the drug control you.  Medication ""holidays"" are great to do."	10	July 13, 2019	36
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	If it wasn’t for Adderall I would be a basket case no questions asked. I'm 55 been on it since 2014 on an everyday basis. I'll take a day off every so often, but it's a rare occasion. My Blood Pressure is 122/74- pulse 64 when moving around normally. Resting my BP is lower along with the pulse rate. If you are relatively healthy heart wise no problems. I know one guy who's pushing 76 years old and he's still taking his prescribed dosage.	10	July 8, 2019	35
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	My son developed tics and we stopped the Adderall medication. Tics remain and one day he hit his head until no hair was there. He also now has blood in his stool no one can explain. Hmmm well permanent  damage isn’t worth the education we are providing now. I would rather buy a franchise than a college degree.	1	July 7, 2019	5
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been taking ADHD Medications for years. I have found that the Generic  Adderall ( Extended Release 20 mg) by Amneal Pharmaceuticals LLC. (CAPSULES STAMPED g454) ARE NOT as effective as other brands	2	July 2, 2019	7
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I've been on and off Adderall IR for the last year. When I'm on Adderall the first 3 months is amazing! I feel highly attentive and motivated. I have to take sleep meds because I'm so wired. The negative is the crash I feel by 6pm. It's like I transform into Angry Smurf - no longer talkative or cheerful and forgot about sex -- my libido shut down. My greatest battle is with food.  I am constantly hungry and when I eat the meds seem to lose its potency therefore causing me to skip meals. I built a tolerance rather quickly on this stuff and it lost its efficacy. IN ANY CASE, DO NOT INCREASE YOUR DOSAGES. Instead take a break from Adderall and try another drug for a couple of months.  This drug is not meant for long term use. Just few month. anything longer is just going to create a monster out of you.	6	July 1, 2019	17
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been taking 50mg of Mydayis for a few months now and I have been happy with my experience on this medicine. I have been on several regimens, including Vyvanse 70 + Dexedrine 10 booster, Adderall XR + Dexedrine 10 booster, Adderall xr + adderall 10 booster, Focalin XR, etc but I decided to give Mydayis a go since my new insurance has it covered on its formulary ($50 a month copay). Like others have said this drug runs in the background but I find it much more consistent and wayyyy longer acting than Adderall XR and even longer than Vyvanse, which only lasted 6 hours max for me. I take it at 5:30am and feel the medicine until about 5pm (~10 hours give or take). Mydayis less anxiety-provoking but I still feel like my ADHD symptoms are controlled around the clock and yet at the same time I feel more like myself than I did strung out on the other medicines. If you’re looking for an option that lasts a long while and your insurance will help pay for it I, think it’s a good option.	10	May 1, 2021	0
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have received my second refill of generic Adderall XR 20 mg made by Mallinckrodt and I am extremely unhappy with it. It is not at all effective. I have been on the non-generic Adderall XR for years without issue.	1	April 29, 2021	1
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have taken Adderall XR and short acting for 25 years and I got this new XR 30MG the other day Lannett and it made me tired, heart racing, BP accelerated and did NOTHING to help me focus. I contacted the pharmacy and my Dr and he's trying to switch me to another brand because this is a joke. awful..	1	April 26, 2021	6
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Just started taking adderall XR 10mg after learning I had been mis-diagnosed for 15+ years as either bi-polar, major depressive disorder and social anxiety. I finally found a psychiatrist that really dug deep and concluded I was not bi polar but I suffered from adult ADHD (33 year old male). It makes total sense as I read more about ADHD. I had been on every possible anti-depressant, anti psychotic MDD etc and was just done with meds. I was diagnosed as a child and teen but thought “ I’d grow out of it” and apparently never did it just got worse. I feel that so many people are mis-diagnosed it’s almost unbelievable. My theory and the doctor also said that if you take the medication and it calms you and your racing thoughts that that’s a tell tail sign that you do indeed suffer from ADHD, it’s not just a childhood/school era problem, it disrupts your life, marriage everything. I’m on day 2 and it’s like a light switch has been turned on and I can relax and not be manic.	9	April 25, 2021	4
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been on and off generic Adderall for many years. Currently, I have been prescribed 30 mg twice a day. For the last couple of months, it's been a nightmare. It's been on backorder and then changed the generic name from amphetamine salts combo to amphetamine/ dextroamphetamine combo. This is only because I have had severe headaches, extreme fatigue, and a loss of motivation. My ADHD has been out of the roof. It's frustrating because I feel like I did before taking any generic Adderall. I have even been concerned that maybe I was receiving a placebo rather than the actual medication. That's probably far-fetched, but it's been such a decline for me. There is something missing from this generic form and it is the essential thing that is needed to control my ADHD. I have even gained a lot of weight over the past two months. Hopefully, something will give, I can't imagine it affecting people like this and nothing changing.	3	April 19, 2021	8
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	This pill does not work like any Adderall that I have experienced. There is neither the focus or the energy bump that is typically associated with the two most therapeutic aspects of the formulation. The vast majority of time I feel equally as sleepy and unfocused as I did when I took it.    I am an experienced user of this positive life-changing medication. The patients that us this medication are in a bad position when company’s that make inferior generic medications are allowed distribution rights through equally as corrupt retail pharmaceutical outlets seeking to make a few pennies extra per script, on the back of patients whose experienced opinion is rarely considered.	2	April 17, 2021	2
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have taken ADHD meds many years. Adderall XR is the ADHD med that works the best for me. I am taking a generic manufactured by Lannett. It by far has worked the best for me with the reason(s) being is the smoothness, the come up is very quick, and it does it's job perfectly.   To reiterate, Lannett is very smooth with a quick come up, and last long enough most days.	9	April 15, 2021	4
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	If anyone else is having a terrible time with the new Lannett generic adderall you can report this to the FDA.  I have been having crippling headaches, stomach aches, and the medication doesn’t even feel like it works!!! I get tired after I take it and then can’t sleep all night because of it. HORRIBLE. Google fda medwatch online reporting to fill in the form	1	April 9, 2021	37
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Right now I take 50mg Lamictal for my Bipolar and 7.5mg twice a day Adderall for ADHD. At first I wasn't sure Adderall was going to work for me, I was initially prescribed 20mg twice a day.  That dose ended up being way too high for me, It made be become manic and I felt really wired all the time.  I now take 7.5mg twice a day and have found it to be much better. I feel alert and focused throughout the day.  Some of the side effects I have had are weight loss, jaw clenching, and mild insomnia (I usually just take melatonin). Overall, Adderall has helped me a lot, I just had to find the right dosage.	8	April 8, 2021	0
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been on Adderall for several years and the Sandoz brand is TOXIC and HORRIBLE! At first it is like a sugar pill no effect and then dizziness, headache, feeling more confused, spaced out and mind blank, extreme fatigue. I can't believe this is on the market. FDA honestly needs to step up their game and monitor the generics. It is a up and down roller coaster with different manufactures each month. This is insane. They are robbing us blind in the pharmaceutical business. They give us something toxic or a placebo. What is happening to the medications now. Please do not take the Sandoz. Read the court documents about reviews on them and they came from the company. Making themselves sound great as a pretend customer!! I can not believe how bad this medication from this manufacture is.	1	April 6, 2021	10
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Worked really well for the first week or so, but then really made me more irritable and gave me uncontrollable suicidal urges that ultimately sent me to the hospital. The suicidal urges stopped after dropping the medication.  I wouldn't recommend against the medication, I would just proceed with caution as the side effects can vary in intensity from person to person.	1	April 3, 2021	3
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been prescribed Amphetamine Salt Combo which has worked well(I have ADD and narcolepsy). Today I was given from RX, Amphetamine Aspertate, it make me fell kinda sickness. Was I given the wrong medicine. The prescription has not changed ?	7	April 1, 2021	3
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’ve been on Adderrall immediate release for at least 8 years, probably more. At first Adderrall gave me an intense high and made me very talkative. Very talkative. That lasted for a few days and after that each morning when I took it it gave me a euphoric feeling for about have the day. I wasn’t making impulsive decisions like I had in the past and my focus was razor sharp. I really enjoyed this drug for sometime but the last 3-5 years it’s just been the same old same old. I take it in the morning and have somewhat of a boost in energy and focus but after around 11am the effects of the medication just wears off. I wind up feeling irritable, decent level of focus if I’m busy at work, and just downright not very social with people. This week I’m going to see my P.A. and hopefully get on Vyvanse which I was encouraged by many to try before jumping on Adderrall. Vyvanse is more expensive but I’m ready to feel more focused and more myself.	5	March 28, 2021	4
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	This review is for generic Adderall XR - amphetamine/dextroamphetamine. I've experienced wildly different effects from different manufacturers. Some days it didn't work. Some days it worked great. But I got severe debilitating headaches that lasted 24/7 and didn't go away using ibuprofen. Went to neurologist and got an MRI. If I could push past the side effects it did work well but for only about 4-5 hours after kicking in (which took about an hour). Needed a booster of IR in the afternoon, so eventually I couldn't deal with the headaches and switched to IR completely. Headaches gone almost immediately. I still get them with IR but not anywhere near as often or as bad.	6	March 23, 2021	1
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	"I've tried several ADHD meds and Mydayis has definitely been the best for me. I'm on the lowest dose and it starts working 20-30 minutes after I take it. I'm then able to be productive and direct my focus easily, compared to other meds (eg-Adderall) which gave me a burst of intense focus that I had no control over. The transitions are barely noticeable and it really helps maintain consistent energy levels. After wearing off, it's a very natural ""I've worked all day and now I'm ready to relax before bed"" feeling (no crash). I also noticed it significantly helps manage my depression-something no other ADHD med has done. The only downsides: (1) it does reduce my appetite a lot and (2) it only lasts about 9-10 hours on my current dose (12.5mg), but higher doses (25mg+) give me headaches. It's not perfect, but the positives definitely outweigh the negatives for me. Lastly-you don't know how it'll affect you, so don't let reviews scare you away if you/your doc think it might help."	9	March 21, 2021	4
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I was diagnosed with ADHD at age 17 and only really started taking stimulant medication after I had turned 20 last year. I was originally trying out varying doses of IR but started trying XR in the past few months.  Overall: Hit or miss for me. It does help with my focus, but the side effects and how much it helps varies pretty drastically depending on the day. Biggest side effects are dehydration, lack of appetite, potentially crashing at night (normal). I also feel a bit uncomfortable sometimes (anxiety-ish twitchy feeling) but that's not very common.  The mallinckrodt brand I was switched to recently seems maybe a bit more hit or miss honestly I can't really tell that much of a difference (unlike people on opioids who swear that mallinckrodt is awful). I'm on 25mg for now and I'm gonna keep seeing how I feel in the coming weeks. Helps with ADHD no doubt, but do be weary of the side effects.	7	March 16, 2021	2
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I took Mydayis 37.5 mg for 2 years. I just recently ran out and decided to wait a week to refill. I cannot believe the change in myself! While on it I became withdrawn and too focused on 1 specific thing. I cut out people and ruined my small business. I didn't feel human! I can't explain the feeling but now that I haven't taken it in a week I feel like myself again! I was just flesh living day by day on mydayis! I will NEVER touch it again! Please tell me there's others out there with similar experiences	1	March 12, 2021	5
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	"I have been taking teva 20mg adderall from 06-19 when they disappeared. I had already suffered from side effects from other generics due to CVS giving me a different generic a few times without consent or being informed. I did the whole google wormhole for a few months before finally seeing a random comment about ""INACTIVE"" ingredients and how this person suffered terrible side effects across multiple generic medications with this same ""INACTIVE"" ingredient. Being on multiple meds myself and having autoimmune and neuro disorders it affected my mental health knowing something wasn't right and just not grasping why & not understanding. That random comment changed everything for me ""INACTIVE"" does not equal no effect.  Teva not being an option then and now not at all I use Mallinckrodt and Arubindo 20 mg. I find it helps to switch them every couple months or I take M in the morning and A in the afternoon depending on how my body is functioning. I tried SAndoz that was terrible side effects."	8	March 6, 2021	2
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	My 7 year old son is a first grader and was recently diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. He has been recommended Adderall for this but I am a bit reluctant to initiate its usage. I have a few reservations about how long it lasts in our system which I have heard can prove to be dangerous for a young kid. I have read multiple articles like these, but I am still not so sure. Seeing the number of experienced people here, please tell me if I should continue with it.		March 4, 2021	4
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	First time taking Alvogen generic amphetamine with dextroamphetamine 30mg. Been taking adderall for 2 years but always Teva generic. Oh my God, the Alvogen brand has made me feel so sick. All over severe headache, nauseous, vomiting, diarrhea. I feel awful.

ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Been taking adderall for years. Until the had me try a white stop sign shaped one by mallinckrodt since there was an adderall shortage at my Walgreens. mallinckrodt amphetamine/dextroamphetamine shouldn’t even be labeled as amphetamine/dextroamphetamine it should just be sold as a caffeine pill because all it does is wake you up subtlety. It doesn’t help with focus whatsoever. I’ve already filed a complaint with the FDA and recommend everyone else do the same	1	February 25, 2021	20
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I take the 10 mg amphetamine with dextroamphetamine by Teva and it works great, better than the 15 mg.in my opinion. I see others mentioning generics by Alogen and Mallinckrodt here. Well I take a couple of other medications manufactured by these 2, on and off, most times it's Mallickrodt. Let me tell you, this is the WORST drug manufacturer on the market. The Alogen is junk too. I've been on a few medical chat sites just to see what I can find out about Mallinckrodt and see if others felt the same way and they absolutely do! Literally 100's of people have complained to the co. itself and to the FDA. This has been going on for a solid 5 years at least & the stuff is STILL pure unadulterated JUNK.	7	February 21, 2021	25
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Switched from Concerta to Mydayis for the longer duration mechanism Mydayis offers. Was started on 25mg of Mydayis. ADD symptoms improved but I experienced dry mouth, dizziness, heart increase, and appetite decrease which subsided after the first week. Second week I felt like the dose was not effective. Doc switched me to 37.5mg of the mydayis and so far symptoms of ADD improved but side effects are rough. Dry mouth, headache, dizziness, lack of appetite, increased anxiety. I’m on day 4 or 5 so hoping the side effects subside when my body adjusts to the higher dose... fingers crossed.	6	February 20, 2021	4
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I am currently on Adderall XR 30MG, and it has changed so many different aspects of my life, including depression.  I was prescribed Adderall because I was about to be terminated from my job. Back to the drug, I take it around 6am everyday, and found that my overall mood has changed. I am not as emotional as I was before, yet I am still able to express my feelings when necessary without the full breakdowns. I have been dealing with Major Depressive Disorder, and this medication has alleviated most of those feelings.  However, the medication has not been a miracle drug, and it contains no magic! For me, ADD has always been there. For me, it took me to be 36 years old to finally realize it was time to visit a psychiatrist, regardless of all the negative stigmas; I was glad I did, because it gave me many suspected answers, rather than self diagnosing situations.	9	February 15, 2021	17
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’ve taken adderall for years. I used to be on Lannett brand and Walgreens recently switched to TEVA. I had my script switched from CVS to Walgreens because it was closer to me. I have been on it for 3 months and the side effects are TERRIBLE.  I clench my teeth so bad my teeth have broken, I am severely depressed, I can’t find happiness in literally anything. I don’t feel motivated at all. If anything I feel less motivated to get out of bed. My skin is dry, my eyes are sinking in and I get terrible migraines. My anxiety is so bad I’m anti social, and I thought I had a stroke because of side effects. I’m 25. Just don’t take it		February 13, 2021	7
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I take two 30 mg pills a day for ADHD and it has really made a huge difference in my life. I am able to focus on one task at a time and complete it. Works great for giving me the motivation I sometimes lack. Only issue is that when I was given the white or peach ones, they did not seem to work as well as the pink ones. Talked to doctor about it and she added to my prescription to only receive the pink ones. Curious if anyone else has had this issue	9	February 10, 2021	37
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	ALVOGEN INC has got me all messed up. I've taken ADHD meds since 1st grade and I'm 32 now so I'm very confident in my ability to distinguish between generics that work & don't and why. For the past 4 years I've used the same CVS location to fill my Adderall tab 30mg generic the past two times though I received a pill that looked different thinking okay whatever this happens from time to time it is just a different manufacturer no big deal. I was wrong. I have had insanely high blood pressure increases, trouble sleeping, hardly any focus, SEVERE anxiety like where is feel like I can't breathe suddenly especially when I try to sleep, shaky hands, VERY noticeable heart palpitations, diarrhea, headaches and  weird emotional ups & downs. I've been vegan for 3 months now at first I was seeing a steady decrease in blood pressure but as soon as I started taking this new generic I'm topping out at 161/111 at the doctor a few days ago which is just absolutely bonkers and terrifying	2	February 9, 2021	9
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’ve taken TEVA adderall 20 mg IR for the past 2+ years. It worked greatly for my ADD & as an anti-depressant. HOWEVER, it has changed! Starting July 2020, the TEVA tablet was completely different. It was no longer sweet, the consistency was harder & the efficacy was compromised. I can take it & fall asleep hours later & there is ZERO anti-depressant effect. In fact, it deepens my depression.  I will submit a report to the FDA & I encourage everyone else to. Also, please research the complaints of TEVAs other generics. I’m not sure what to try next. I tried the Sandoz and it was actually worse. I received the hideous Zydus once-which gave me a migraine & intensely aching back.I believe it’s manufactured out of this country.  This experience has made me question ALL generic medications.   Please start researching yours & refuse to take these.  I tried switching to name brands but my ins. refuses to pay.	2	February 8, 2021	11
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Have used a generic for about 6 years now worked for me except it has turned me into a teeth grinder I do it all the time and now my teeth are worn to the point they are ruined.  My doctor said he never heard of that side effect but a recent visit to a dentist to try to fix my teeth I was told they see this all the time and this grinding may never go away. I need to find something that works without these side effects	6	February 4, 2021	9
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’ve been in this medication for almost a year . And it change my life in good way. Made me focus on my goals and I want to achieve and increased my motivation to become better person also balance my mood and decreased my depression.	9	January 19, 2021	14
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been taking Teva amphetamine/dextroamphetamine (adderall generic) for quite sometime for ADHD. In the last year, I noticed right away something was off. First was the obvious color. The Teva that has always worked for me with no problems (that was being weaned out in 2019) was as follows..  peach color and sweet, easy to swallow and not gag on. Teva now, is orange. The sweet taste that made it bearable to take has changed completely. My focus, clarity, motivation, and concentration has been/is immensely effected by the new ingredient change. (I don't have it at all)  My overall mental health, has declined quickly. It has caused my mood to completely change, headaches are constant, and upset stomach. All of this, and they don't even work. I struggle everyday now. Less main ingredient and more fillers means more pills can be produced, which means more money in the manufacturer's pocket..... Mental health should be top priority, especially being consistent with and not changing the ingredients.	1	January 17, 2021	51
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	This month is the first time I received sandoz adderall ER and it doesn't seem to work very well for me. Mallinckrodt doesn't seem to work too well for me either. I think Teva seems to work the best for me; even better than the name brand for adderall.	6	January 17, 2021	2
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have suffered with ADHD since I was a young kid, I got diagnosed at the youngest age possible and I never got any help for it by my old doctor.  With my new doctor, he gave me Adderall XR to start out with 10 and than up it to 20 within a week if not effective.   I am on 20 MG now and it has changed my life, I failed school and life because I couldn't pay attention and now not only can I pay attention but this has also helped as my ADHD had caused Depression/Anxiety also OCD.	10	January 15, 2021	14
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Generic Adderall varies significantly depending on mfg. Reason being, the FDA says the mfg only has to “demonstrate” it “works in the same way “ as the brand-name. i.e. generic ingredients do  Not have to be same which is why so many don’t work and/or make people feel sick. My experience, the only generic that works like the brand-name is Prasco, which acquired Teva’s generic xr in 2016.  Few pharmacies use Prasco as their generic because it’s more expensive!  My Dr specifies “Prasco generic only” on my prescription for D-Amphetamine ER 30MG Salt combo. By law, the pharmacy must comply if Prasco is one of their overall suppliers. My insurance changed so I called Prasco to see if they sell to Costco. They do. Just takes a day or 2 for the pharmacist to order and fill my script. Walgreens used Prasco as their generic until recently. Now it’s Mallinckrodt which just filed for bankruptcy to settle a slew of opioid lawsuits. It’s all about $		January 8, 2021	60
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	The adderall name brand is 2-3 times better than generic adderall XR. The FDA should be inspecting these generic companies and make sure they are getting as high of quality ingredients. I urge anyone in generics to try real adderall for a month then decided for yourself. Decide to report the generics because we should be able to get a cheaper still 90$ for generic compared to $220+ for name brand.	10	January 7, 2021	18
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’m a doctor with ADHD. I’ve been on the generics to cut costs during tough times but I insist on the name brand adderall. No only is it smoother it lasts longer and helps even more than the generics. It’s a shame that cost is a bearing on necessary prescriptions and that generic are so much weaker and poorer quality. Generic adderall needs to step it up they have quality issues and their recipe is somehow flawed.	5	January 7, 2021	25
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I've only been taking it for 3 days but I can understand now when people say they feel it running in the background. So far no side effects other than appetite loss. I do feel energy from this but not like Adderall there's no anxiety tied to the energy its more like motivation than energy. One thing I've noticed is I like to always be doing something that is productive in some way. It's not the type of energy you get and use to dance or workout you feel driven to get things done.  It last for the whole 16 hours which surprised me I'm an ultra rapid metabolizer. I have no crash on this like I did with Adderall. I'm just waiting for my period now to see how the cramps are and giving the medicine more time to see if I do have any side effects, so far none but no appetite.	10	January 3, 2021	11
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I've been taking dextroamp-amphet ER 15mg once a day for roughly 3 months now and it's helped me greatly until 2 weeks ago and it's as if I cut my dose by 3/4! Is this normal and what dose, frequency, and type of adderall should I change to? I've heard about generic vs name brand, so what do the best ones look like?	6	December 30, 2020	1
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I've been prescribed adderall for 10yrs+ and without it mentally and physically I would be worse. I do have soreness, achy body, etc but have other health problems. Adderall has ROTTED MY TEETH OUT. Being 42 years old, fear ability to retain with out medicine as I age. I have severe withdrawal, to include extreme fatigue, severe constipation. I need the Adderral and helps some as without it life would be more difficult. All and all I would not manage without it very well but it is less effective as been taking for years. Take care and God Bless All. Be Safe!	7	December 24, 2020	10
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Regarding the post by DrKatz on 11/7/2020:.  I too take the 20 mg salt combo- manufactured by Teva, and have been on that specific brand for two and a half years.  I can definitely concur that something has changed with their product.   I am on a prescription of 80 mg a day and I too noticed a difference in taste, consistency of the pill itself, and it not working as well as it used to.  I am aware of a recall May 22nd by Teva for a few of their doses- the 20mg pill being one of them.   Thinking placebo, I inspected the pill closely: the depression level of the imprint is different, slight change in the oblong shape, the edging* (*like the cut/side profile of floor boards) and thickness + curvature.   The taste difference (bitter) I noticed in August. October back to normal but currently (Nov.) the taste changed again- however this time with a much greater chemical profile- like bactine or rubbing alcohol, more crumbly and not working as well for either my ADHD or narcolepsy.	8	November 15, 2020	29
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’ve been on Adderall XR 20 mg since October 6th 2020. I have to say this medication is life changing and your psychiatrist, doctor or whatever will try and find the right dosage for you. I’m 22 years old, Male and I noticed the medication working within an hour, I’m about 220 pounds 5’8 and despite that it still kicked in relatively fast. The side affects I notice the most are as follows dry mouth, appetite suppression, some irritability, and insomnia on occasion. Adderall XR for me last anywhere from 8-12 hours, if it wears off the medical professional in most cases will add Adderall IR to take in the afternoon, since upping the dose of XR will not increase duration only the intensity of the medication itself. ADHD medication is all about finding what’s right for YOU, don’t give up if it doesn’t get manageable or fixed after the first try.	9	November 8, 2020	42
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have always used Teva Adderall IR because I have had horrible experiences with other generic, including inconsistency and lack of potency.  Understand that I have taken Teva Adderall 20MG tablets over five years, thus it would less difficult for someone like me to detect subtle changes in its effects.  I have noticed the following, and this started around September 2020.  Teva generic Adderall tablets seem (and this is very subtle) smaller in size. Second: Teva is known for its slight sweet taste. It is almost as if that is completely  gone... I’m certainly not saying that added anything to it, but I’m saying it’s an indicator  of some sort of formula change.  Finally, although the 20MG tablet is small, it used to be easy to half the tablet. Recently they just crumble. To summarize, I have also noted a very marked decrease in efficacy.	7	November 7, 2020	26
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Adderall XR is Life changing (positively). I went from being massively distractable and procrastinate constantly to getting things done. I'm not just referring to school work or office work. I mean just showing up on time to meet up with friends. Not getting instantly bored with family.  I truly love it!   --- Quick warning, take it as your doctor recommends! So much of the bad press comes from people abusing the drug.  Likewise, if you're able, take a day off now and then. Perhaps on days when you don't need to work or do much. It's sort of like coffee/tea/caffeine in that sense. Fine if you do take it everyday, but probably best if you give your mind/body a rest from it now & then.  Just like running or exercise, you need light or rest days each week to really get the most from the workout.	10	November 6, 2020	34
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	My grades instantly went from the 60s and 70s to 90s and 100s and for once I felt like I had control over my life. The side effects were pretty bad and inconsistent though, so I had to go from 20 to 15 mg.	9	November 4, 2020	18
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	The Adderal dose my doctor prescribed didn't seem to work that great(20 mg twice a day)  One day I had it after my oatmeal and it was more effective so after that I just scrunched up the pill like I did with oatmeal, but I didn't put it on anything.  I just took it like that. Works great!  Much more motivation to get tasks done so I can finish more!  Maybe you could try that if it sees not enough to work.  I use Sandoz.	10	October 11, 2020	20
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Adderall XR was originally prescribed to me for ADD, but it worked best as a terrific antidepressant.  However, now that I've been on it for 20 straight years at 40-80 mg. Daily, it has very little antidepressant effect now. It's Adderall burnout -- apparently it strips the brain of dopamine -- the feel-good hormone.        I still have to take it just to do anything at all each day.  The worst effect is insomnia -- no matter how early I take it.  It keeps me up for 24 hours unless I finally have to take Seroquel for sleep.  Seroquel is the only thing that will knock out Adderall XR.  But I hate it because it makes me so damn sluggish in the morning, awful.        I cannot believe it's 2020, and there is still no decent antidep medication available,	8	October 1, 2020	31
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	The last 9 months generic “Zydus” was the only brand of amphetamine/dextroamphetamine available in my area. I noticed pretty nasty side effects beginning 45 minutes after consumption. I’ve never felt depression so severely before taking Zydus. Teva/Barr has returned. Felt a night and day difference the first day. Hope Zydus gets banned for the safety of us all.	1	September 23, 2020	20

ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I switched over to Mydayis in hope of finding something that could last the entire day. My days are usually nonstop for approx 16 hours. I started at the lowest dose and went up to the 50mg after 3 weeks. Gave it a few more weeks in hopes that it would work like how we wanted it to. The negative side effects outweigh the positives. The first thing I noticed was ejaculatory anhedonia. It led to an unplanned pregnancy before I caught it. The rest included falling behind in classes and not being able to keep up at work. Felt lazy and not wanting to do anything. It was like being unmedicated all over again!	4	September 21, 2020	8
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Generic Adderall:  TEVA vs. ALVOGEN “All generic adderall is NOT the same trust me!...... I don’t care what your physician or pharmacist may say.“  I’ve taken Adderall for nearly 25 plus years for ADD.  WHY? it works twice as good ask anyone whose taken different brands before. For the BEST quality and most potent adderall on the market is made by a company called TEVA.  Even pharmacist tell me when they run out of TEVA and must use ALVOGEN their patients complain because the pharmacies cannot keep TEVA in stock because the consumers know it’s the best and most effective for ADD and ADHD.	1	September 15, 2020	133
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have taken both Adderall and its generic(amphetamine/dextroamphetamine) for over 16 years for my Adult Attention Deficit Disorder. I have found that the original Adderall has the best effectiveness and in these last 4 tears Teva [still oval, peach/orange color] working the best for my A.D.D. Pills made by Mallinkrodt I only get by mistake, and still act like a placebo in May 2020. Dose: 20mg. X 2 daily.		August 25, 2020	24
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I do not like this formula. I have been on various generics for years and did not feel like this 10 mg did anything. Unfortunately, I've already filled this prescription and am stuck with this medication.	1	August 24, 2020	7
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been taking Adderall for most of my adult life and Walgreens always carried the generic version that worked best for me but recently they changed who they get it from now and the new amphetamine / dextroamphetamine from Lannett MFG SUCK!  They do not work at all - actually the worst next to the  YELLOW ROUND Mp 447's, PINK ROUND Cor 136's, or OCTAGON WHITE ONES.   The TEVA amphetamine/dextroamphetamine Peach Oval B 974's are the ones that work best for me and now I don' t know how to get them - Help..	10	June 16, 2020	94
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	My concern in taking generic Adderall IR for several years is the effect is has on my heart  When I take it, at the prescribed dose,  I most always have sinus tachycardia  (a heart rate above 100 beats per minute)  I also have noticed that it effects bladder emptying....and my urinary stream seems slower (and I am fairly young) and I am not usually able to completely empty my bladder.	6	June 10, 2020	26
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Since the shortage for about 3 months I've been taking generic Zydus 20mg. How do these drugs pass inspection? I think a couple pixie sticks would work better. I wonder if generic adderall from any manufacturer will ever get better. I think charging over $5.00 for this rubbish should be criminal.	1	June 7, 2020	40
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	This medication amphetamine/dextroamphetamine has made me feel VERY JITTERY and sick to my stomach! I take generic TEVA brand orange tab 30 mg. The pharmacy didn’t have any of the TEVA brand so they gave me generic U31 tablet - Aurolife Pharma, LLC brand. This is horrible! People take time off work to be seen by doctor, get put on meds for a reason, spend money for the appointment and meds, all the time you spend doing this & it can’t be returned back to Walmart to get my right medicine because “it’s against the law” supposedly! Even when I have the entire prescription (minus one) to give them back. Why make people feel like this when they do so much to try and make life easier being on their meds. I don’t have insurance so my doc visit is almost $100 & medicine is around $60 every month. My 7 year old daughters meds were switched as well. I’m scared to even give her medicine! How can Walmart just give you a different brand that you’ve never taken and not tell me before I leave it’s different!?	1	June 5, 2020	67
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I am a male in my thirties. Adderall is the third drug I tried to tread ADHD after doing trials on Vyvanse and Concerta. Vyvanse worked but did not last long enough and I had bad crashing (headache, exhaustion). Concerta did not work for me at all, made me lethargic and even more distracted.  Adderall at 20mg a day gives me energy to focus on work and my kids. It lasts me until sometime in the evening. I have trouble sleeping some nights on it, other than that the side effects are negligible.	8	May 3, 2020	43
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Activist Dextramp-amphet ER (30 mg.) [ generic for Adderall ]  is HORRIBLE. NOT effective. Causes nausea. HORRIBLE. I have taken this drug for over 3 years and I know what it is supposed to do.	1	April 30, 2020	40
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Adderall is very useful but recently I was ignorant and thought it would be okay to take a little extra at night to help clean my house. I took a bigger extra dose then I should have and a few hours later I felt pretty awful. I am very productive and more positive on the right dose of this med, so I recommend trying it or Desoxyn, because it is said to have fewer side effects like anxiety and panic and irritability post dose. Like all meds, Adderall is a blessing when dosed right and a curse when dosed incorrectly. I noticed that I paced around a bit when on it but I didn’t feel that anxious. It isn’t fun and enjoyable to take a big dose, don’t do it. God made everything to be used in moderation and it is much better for the whole society when we obey the wise instructions of our doctors and leaders. Be careful, obey your doctor, and may God bless you all to succeed in your treatment plans and in your lives. Amen	8	March 18, 2020	74

ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Recently changed pharmacies and didn't realize that there can be quite a difference between generics. For 4 years I’ve taken adderall 2x day, 10 mg. Never any problems until I switched pharmacies to save $.  Elite Pharma is who makes this new one and it is NOT GOOD.   I am lethargic, unable to focus, quite sleepy.  It’s as if I haven’t even taken anything.  Incredibly frustrating as I am not even half way through this months supply.	1	March 7, 2020	50
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	The generic manufacturer of amphetamine & dextroamphetamine, Sandoz, is the only one that works for me. This month the manufacturer is Northstar and last month Aurobindo, and they are garbage. They don’t help AT ALL with my focus. Zero.  I am irritable. I am getting nothing done and my anxiety is sky high. I am going to stop taking these brands and ask pharmacy for Sandoz.  I complained to the FDA and urge others to do so as well. This is ridiculous.	1	March 3, 2020	70
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Adderall has worked great for me when taken as needed. When I was in my early 20’s and taking it daily I built up a dependence that lead to terrible withdrawals as it is very addictive. (Learned the hard way and never want to go through that again!)  I will usually only take this when my ADHD symptoms are unbearable and my work/personal life starts to become affected. We are talking maybe 1-4 tablets max per month.  It really does help with focus and energy, and I find that one 10-20mg dose is usually enough and I feel good for several days after the dose without any withdrawals or dependence issues.

ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	If you're taking for ADHD please note there are a lot of side effects, having said this, they are sometimes serious so take note to talk to your doctor. If you get cold fingers or toes, make sure to consult your doctor as it's a syndrome that can be prevented.  It does help with focus, it helps with impulse control, it helps with a general overall euphoric feeling and it can cause you to lose a lot of weight. Be sure to eat, EAT, don't shake your head, you know I'm talking to you. Eat and stay hydrated it causes you to urinate a LOT, make sure to supplement what you are losing. It will cause tremors, shakes, and irritability, again, eat food. Make sure to stick to a 2000 calorie diet AT LEAST. May cause muscle fatigue and extreme soreness, stay hydrated, make sure of this.  Some say it causes better grades in school, well, to an extent. It just makes you write a lot. Eat Eat Hydrate And maybe take melatonin to help promote rest. I warned and entertained you.	7	February 21, 2020	97
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	My daughter developed tardive dyskinesia, a permanent drug-induced movement disorder, while on Adderall. If your kid has ODD, stay away from all stimulates; they are most at-risk.	1	February 19, 2020	26
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I totally agree that the new A 79 generics are no good.  I mean they work a little bit, but I feel taking the same amount of the other oblong orange ones that taste like sweet we’re way better.  These taste like nasty chalk.    I’ve never had adderal brand though so I wouldn’t that difference.	3	February 19, 2020	25
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been on  adderal 15mg 2×daily  for 7 yrs it has completely change my life.  I  was always down, depressed, unmotivated, impulsive, always day dreaming, short attention span, no focus and couldn't sitting still. Adderal has given me a new happy life that I can enjoy and appreciate. Starting to think I need to go up to 20mg. I can feel I'm getting used to them. But without them I wouldn't get out of bed and would waste my life.I  think adderal is my miracle drug I have never been so grateful for a prescription drug	10	February 17, 2020	111
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I was diagnosed with ADHD combined type and have tried Ritalin and Focalin. Both weren't that great for me so my doctor prescribed me 10 mg of Adderall XR. Adderall has made me have better multitasking skills and helped me pay attention. It hasn't really helped with being hyper or being impulsive and has given me bad twitching eyes. It also has made my sleep schedule weird so watch out for that.	6	February 6, 2020	23
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Picked up amphetamine with dextroamphetamine medicine 1/24/20, bottle said Barr brand? But Teva tabs were inside. Teva bought Barr in 07. Before Teva bought out multiple companies and started using their ingredients within the last 2-3 years, they were great. Sandoz and Corepharma have been the only other decent makers, before they were bought out. I haven’t noticed a thing from picking these up 1/24. The worst medicine I’ve had from Teva in 8 years.	1	February 4, 2020	36
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	On 1/24/2020 I received Teva generic IR Adderall like I usually have for the last 7 years off and on (used to be good.) Except Barr was labeled on the bottle for the first time ever. Not sure why since Teva bought Barr in 07. Regardless it isn’t any better, by far the worst I’ve had of Teva. But every other company is pathetic. Brand works 10X better but 10X pricier. If the FDA enforced the rule of not less than 80% and no more than 125% concentrated effectiveness, that would be a first! The right MG of each dose might be regulated, but the fillers/inactive ingredients added is the big issue. 1-3 used to be in the old Barr/ Shire/ Sandoz/ Core and those worked fantastic. Every generic now has 5-8 fillers that make it less effective but also cause severe side effects. FDA could care less about small market drugs.	1	February 3, 2020	50
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Game changer. First DX by A pdoc: ADHD. What, no?  Yes.  I felt like I was only working with one puzzle piece and finding out about ADHD was like being given the other 999 pieces. At first Adderall IR didn’t seem to do much but I slowly realized it was like putting emotional and mental blinders on where I could see the rest of the world but mainly focus on the task at hand. Job saver for sure.  Since I have a high tolerance to meds XR saved me from constantly trying to remember to take next dose when I started crashing. Tops.	10	February 3, 2020	30
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have found the generic brand for Adderall is not effective as the brand name. The Epic brand caused me to have severe depression, blurred vision, headaches, very tired and no focus at all.  I’m trying to find a brand that is much like the name brand. Looking for suggestions if anyone can share please. Thanks	1	January 29, 2020	97
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I went to pharmacy to pick up my Adderall generic brand Zydus. I was told they was out of my brand. I was given the Epic brand. The Epic brand caused me to have severe depression and I stayed in bed, I’ve always been very energetic. I stopped taking it. I called the Pharmacist and reported the side effects I had. Pharmacist didn’t act surprised at all, stated we are out of your regular brand and probably won’t get it back in.	1	January 28, 2020	18

ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	"I was so glad to see these posts.  Pharmacies are so rude to me. I switched to so many brands, but they say they are all alike, and say it doesn't matter which generic I get, because they're all the same.  My doctor, unfortunately, thinks the same.  I finally said to the pharmacy tech one day, ""I'm sure I'm not the only one, who would like certain generics."" She said, no, I'm the only one. I know this sounds crazy, but the blue 10mg of teva, don't seem to work like the 15mg of the peach teva, even if I cut one of the blue in half to make it 15mg."	8	January 23, 2020	92

I'm a regularly joyful and excited person but every emotion I had felt muted or stunted while on amphetamine/dextroamphetamine. I stopped talking it and 3 days later felt so much better. I was joyful again! Back to pinging all over the place but at least I'm happy doing it lol. I'm trying Concerta next.	4	January 21, 2020	3
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Ok so I have Both Narcolepsy/Extreme Fatigue & ADD. The generic forms of Adderall (amphetamine and dextroamphetamine) seem to be getting worse and worse. They are making them with obviously cheaper so-called similar ingredients but the new generic amphetamine and dextroamphetamine drugs just have bad side effects and don’t work for me at all or are far less effective. I don’t know if it is Teva brand that is making these cheap ineffective knock-offs that cause migraines & other side effects but they are definitely not working or decent. The generic form Amphetamine Salts works just fine for me but again I think when Teva took over and apparently used far cheaper Ingres there is definitely a disconnect because I don’t think Dextroamp-Amphetamin is a worthy generic form of Adderall but maybe just because Teva brand seems to be using incredibly cheap ingredients,	10	January 20, 2020	21
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I've had ONE DOSE.  Let me be clear.  I took one 25mg pill 6 hours ago and I'm so sleepy I can't see straight.  I slept 7.5 hours last night so I don't understand the drowsiness.	5	January 9, 2020	33
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’ve been on adderall for a few years now and it was life changing. I’ve always been prescribed a generic and have never had a problem until recently. I noticed that I was not getting the same benefit as I was previously and for months, tried to convince myself that it was in my head and then one month, I noticed everyday that I felt great! Looked at the pill imprint and what do you know - it was a different manufacture (Amneal) than the one I was taking. I started googling it and saw a lot of complaints for generic Adderall from Global Pharmaceutical. I’m talking to pharmacist today about it and requesting the generic by Amneal Pharmaceuticals. I thought they were all the same and it’s a shame that global can make these any less effective than what they should be. Is it so people go to their dr, say they don’t feel the effects of it and get an increase? Sounds like a big pharma thing to do. Trust your gut instinct because you’re the person who knows you best.	1	January 8, 2020	17
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	"I recently was given this new form of adderall from the pharmacy which was circular with just an ""A"" on one side... I did not like this new form of Adderall at all!! I assumed it would have the same effect as the typical oval shaped and it was completely different which is a little scary. It was very bitter and gross tasting unlike the football shaped one has a sweet note. It also disintegrated turning to powder immediately, as I attempted to break it in half (waste of product). I did not get any focus from it nor did I feel any different at all?? It did nothing! Then the next day got a horrible headache! I was talking with a friend who also mentioned getting the same thing recently. He mentioned having an extremely bad headache too the following day, so we now know it's from this form of adderall. I DO NOT LIKE IT. It should be pulled from the market honestly I don't know what the heck this rubbish  is but it is not adderall."	2	January 2, 2020	79
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Was first diagnosed with ADD(inattentive type) by multiple doctors at 18 years old. Out of the gate they prescribed me 60mg IR amphetamine with dextroamphetamine. I am now 26, taking 80mg/day, and have learned a substantial amount about this drug. No it won't make you any smarter or develop hidden talents, most believe this. The generic (dextroamphetamine-amphetamine IR) is cheaper than its brand (Adderall xr.) Obviously brand is set to higher standards of quality than generics, so yes brand name anything works better than generics, it's common sense. If you use it correctly and find the right manufacturer like Teva, you most likely won't find as many negatives as most people.	8	December 30, 2019	9
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’ve been taking the generic version of Adderall for about 2 years now. I was tired all the time and couldn’t focus. I felt like a slug and when I had energy I still had brain fog, and had a hard time studying. In class, I would fidget in my chair, doodle, and listen to lectures, but nothing would stick in my head. No matter how long I studied.  I was prescribed the 7.5 mg tablet once a day and just the small dose did wonders for my energy levels and let me focus and actually get things done. It helped me talk in social situations and gave me a mood boost.  That being said, The generics changed a couple times. And I’m not sure, but I think I can tell a difference between them. After the pill wears off, my head aches, my legs throb, my body aches, and I’m nauseous and feel sick. I have flu like symptoms, which are miserable. It’s sad because it’s a really small dose and helps me so much but some of the side effects suck. You just gotta see what’s worth it to you.	8	December 24, 2019	61
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	This medication does not work at all now.	1	December 2, 2019	49
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Not very effective; I took a  double dose which cause headaches and made me generally feel ill.  There are  better generics. Company should not be allowed to sell this medication.	1	November 17, 2019	13
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been on Adderal 10 mg for three months now. I have found it helps me so much in the morning. I need to talk to my doctor and see if I can get something for the afternoon. It's been a godsend but I don't have any anger issues just a lot of anxiety. I'm on Xanax as well three times a day and Ambien for sleep which really helps bed by 5 clock I'm wore out. And then my symptoms seem to return. I would recommend this to anyone that has concentration issues. I'm 41 years old and when I went to school they always called you slow. Which always made you look bad. I think my doctor he's wonderful and I'm going to get my Xanax upped and see if I can get something for the afternoon due to that I work many hours a day and I have to be on my toes.	9	November 2, 2019	6
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I got diagnosed with ADHD at the beginning of this school year, being my senior year of high school. Since 8th grade, I've struggled in school, been incredibly impulsive, had very strange eating habits, over-thought everything, and could never contain my anger or anxiety. Once prescribed, my life has changed. My grades went up, and in 3 months I've lost almost 30 pounds (I am still in the normal BMI range). I can control myself. I finally believe in myself because of Adderall.	9	October 29, 2019	80
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Well been on and off Adderall or Ritalin since I was 5. I'm 62 now, and take 60mg XR morning and two 30mg IR in the afternoon. For me it's a Godsend. I can pay attention now,  I'm more sociable, I'm just.......me.	8	October 23, 2019	22
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’m 48 yo woman that was diagnosed with ADHD in elementary.  When I began (on holiday) taking it I’m extremely fatigue/zombie the first 3 days, I am not nearly as engaged with anyone/anything around me (I talk 97% less when I’m on Adderall) and it makes me feel less cognitive.  I feel like it dumbs me down.  After the 3rd day I start to feel better and those “tranquilizer effects” go away. Adderall is an emotional regulator for me. It works wonders for my impulsivity, racing thoughts, fidgeting, feeling overwhelmed, anger, anxiety, zoning out, and my mouth. Yes, my mouth has always been my biggest challenge and has caused me tremendous social/professional problems.  While in a perfect world I’d be on no medication, I have to recommend Adderall for anyone whose suffering from ADHD, because  it has changed my overall quality of life for the best.  Sparkle on beautiful people! 	9	October 23, 2019	81
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I was diagnosed with both bipolar and ADHD. After trying multiple combinations, we finally tried adderall on top of Wellbutrin, Lamictal, and Fluvoxamine for OCD. At first, the adderall did wonders. Completely made me enjoy life again. However, as my tolerance increased, the adderall crash was very intense. It resulted in a bipolar low almost everyday around the same time. I recently just switched to Stratetta and is my second day taking it. Anxious to see how this works.	9	October 22, 2019	29
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’ve been taking meds for ADHD/ADD close to 8 years now.  Tried Adderall at many dosages, types and amount of times per day over a period of many years.  My biggest issue. I forgot to take them.  Tried Vyvanse. It helped but I got nauseous, dizzy every day.  Tried Adderall again and forgot to take them.  One day my doctor mentioned Mydayis. I wouldn’t have to remember taking more than one in the AM.  After a week I could tell that it was helpful but wasn’t able to tell if a BIG difference.  I ran out due to scheduling once & my brain went into hyper drive. I hadn’t felt that chaotic for awhile.  WHILE talking to my doctor she legit wrote out the prescription, handed it to me. ‘go fill it NOW.’ Even had others asking how long I would be without it.  It was clear it helped at that point.  I don’t notice any side effects.  My results with Mydayis are pretty good. No worries of forgetting it, which was the major factor in my switch.	8	October 20, 2019	11
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I'm making this review one year after trying Mydayis for only a week. I switched to this drug from Adderall IR 20's BID to the 37mg capsule, you don't really think your buzzing, but you indeed are, and more so than with Adderall for the same dose. What prompted me to write this review was that I noticed someone else who reviewed this mentioned that they would be returning the bottle to the pharmacy because they didn't want insurance to think they were keeping it. This is an effect of the drug, I too, even though I bought it on the $5 coupon, did not want the pharmacy (who does not care) to think that I wanted to keep this drug so I returned the remaining 23 capsules to them. It works well, puts you in a different state of mind, and doesn't provide the sense well being of some other ADHD products offer, but it does work better than some generics. Perhaps give this a try if you're on generics that don't work. It is pretty strong, but doesn't feel like it. if that makes sense.	7	October 14, 2019	12
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I was on 10MG XR for 3 months and it worked amazingly. This is a very good medication if you have trouble functioning like a normal person, although be prepared for really dark thoughts if you decide to stop taking it. Withdrawal from this drug is no joke, it can make you want to die...but if you keep taking it or taper off slowly you should be fine.		October 12, 2019	22
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I was diagnosed with ADD in 2005 after experiencing horrible distractibility in class while at college and not being able to focus on a single thought in my head.  I was prescribed Adderall IR and I remember feeling like I had drunk 5 Red Bulls or something!  My heart was pounding and I had horrible anxiety the whole day.  I only took it one time.  I decided to get off it immediately.  Soon after, I was prescribed Strattera, which didn't do ANYTHING.  I've gone for about 13 years without actual ADD medications because I really hated the idea of stimulants.  That all changed when I realized my ADD was getting out of control.  I saw my current psychiatrist last week who re-diagnosed me and we discussed my experiences.  I had read reviews from people here who say that Dexedrine works for them if Adderall made them too wired, so I asked if I could try that.  I just tried it today and I had no horrible side effects - no anxiety, no heart palpitations, no edginess, etc.  It is wonderful!	1	October 9, 2019	21
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have suffered my entire life with ADD.  For a while Adderal helped. Then as I turned 49 it seemed to make me more anxious, irritable,  short tempered, and I had No patience for stupidity! Upon trying the Mydayis,  I was immediately impressed. I was finishing projects.  Getting things done right! Able to focus for longer durations of time. Long enough to complete tasks at hand. I feel so much better.	10	October 3, 2019	30
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I will never give this to my child again!, I know all children are different but I'm sticking with Dyanavel XR. While he was on Adderall he was acting angry and violent, like he was on some kind of illegal drug, his facial expressions were intense, and he could not sit still, and was very emotional. so I have to give this a 1 star on my personal experience and my son's	1	October 2, 2019	35
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I've had a prescription for amphetamine with dextroamphetamine for  four years, and Teva used to work fairly well for me. Over the last year or so, it's become awful. I know it isn't me, because I still have old (2-3 years) pills laying around; I tried some of them and they work just fine.   Teva changed something in the manufacturing process. The new pills do almost nothing beneficial (I feel sleepy all day), but they have a ton of side effects. I feel very jittery, my stomach hurts, and I've been experiencing bloating.	1	September 30, 2019	23
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Overall, 20 mg Adderall XR for ADHD helps me to focus. The problem with adderall is it makes me sweat something awful. Anyone else annoyed with sweating while taking adderall?	9	September 28, 2019	62
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Well first off. Adderall is an Amphetamine  which assist with the production of dopamine. Very close  relation to meth. I am 21 years old and I started Adderall again. Previously I was on Adderall from age 8-13 and it worked great. Some say ADHD is not real and it just a symptom of bad health etc... I have been very very healthy and unhealthy which produced no changed in brain fog. Now that engineering is my main task in like I seem to have a hefty amount of brain fog. Adderall does in fact help with focus but the downside is the extreme crashes that happen when you stop taking it.	8	September 26, 2019	20
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been on Adderall for quite sometime. It has helped me focus and also being proactive. I recently got a new script and diff manufacturing teva  I noticed since I have taken it I'm extremely tired. Cannot focus at all I feel like a scatter brain..I had to call my dr to have him rewrite a new script and surrender the Teva (amphetamine with dextroamphetamine) Did anyone get the same reaction?	1	September 26, 2019	20
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I shared my experience recently on here and was going back over and reading others as well.  I believe we should all state the laboratory that producing the specific generic we are each taking. Doing so may help us all narrow down which ones to stay away from and which ones are truly therapeutic.  Eon lab  brand of amphetamine/dextroamphetamine was good until 9 months ago, now they are horrible (no therapeutic value and bad side effects).  I then I switched to Teva and they were decent for about 2 months and now they are giving me side effects.  Plus the pharmacy ran out of them and I had to wait for a new batch and when the new batch came in is when the bad side effect started.  I KNOW the drug manufacturer has changed something.  Hope that helps someone.	2	September 24, 2019	122
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	So, I have had ADHD since I was like young. I never liked the pills they gave me when I was younger because I was already a thin kid and then taking Adderall I would eat even less. So I stopped taking the medication. When I was taking this medication I got most improved student! I went without the drug for years, until just about 2 years ago I started taking it again and It has helped me so much! I am very thankful for this drug. I suffer from fatigue , and many, many other problems. This drug is one of many I NEED, To Think Straight and to not get outta control.  It also helps me BIG TIME with my anger issues. Hope this helps someone! Star Kid Is OUT!	9	September 11, 2019	47
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	This drug is one of the greatest formulas of all time. I went from down and depressed and unmotivated to organized and focused. Also from relatively poor to rich due the effect it had on me with my enthusiasm for work	10	September 11, 2019	57
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I cannot believe that the FDA allows AUROBINDO or TEVA to sale their lousy drugs through pharmacies in the US.  Neither of these generics have any affect on me at all!!  WASTE of money!   They are playing with people's minds and well being!!!!	2	September 6, 2019	110
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Have taken Adderall on and off for around 13 years for ADD and CFS. I was lucky enough to have tried the “real” brand Adderall by Barr laboratories. I’ve never taken over 20mg a day. This medicine has gone to TRASH.The only negative side affect from the Barr version was occasional jaw clinching.   I think Teva must’ve burned the patent formula or something because it has never worked liked the Barr, not even close.  So many negative side effects (migraine headaches, heartburn, nausea)! I keep hoping at some point they might magically start producing a decent version that actually helps instead of hurts.  The original Barr had true therapeutic value.  Eon labs produced a decent generic for a while, but BAM, it suddenly went to garbage at the end of 2018.  So switched back to Teva a couple months back and it started ok( not as good as Eon but better than everything else out there), then last months refill is feeling like they’re changing to something bad too.  Bring back real Adderall!	3	September 4, 2019	78
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I had taken Adderall for many years and was slowly on the decline.  I was deeply depressed and had an absolute hopeless and helpless outlook on life with no relief. I had psychosis, delusions and impulsive behavior which I never had. I began having issues with memory, thinking, reasoning, decision making, tasks, and  concentration.  I would become very agitated if being interrupted. I was very aggressive and agitated constantly, it was at least 98% of the time in 10 years.  I read horror stories about stimulants, namely the Amphetamine line of them. I subsequently tapered off of them and feel 100% better than before. I have no depressive symptoms, delusions, memory problems, agitation or aggressiveness. I was not happy with life and my personal relationships were very toxic. I wasted almost 10 years of my life feeling like this and have other personal complications that resulted from the use of these toxic drugs.	1	August 28, 2019	29
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I'm all shook up. But it works!	9	August 26, 2019	20
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Works well for my adult ADHD. It gets me motivated, and I can feel it kicking in. The perfect dosage for me is the 15mg tablet, morning, and another 15mg after lunchtime! I score the 30mg tablet in half.	9	August 22, 2019	6
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I've had ADHD since I was a kid and after a couple of years taking Ritalin I stopped and then tried it again once in my 20's and again in my 30's but never liked the way it made me feel. Starting in my late 30's I started to suffer from chronic fatigue syndrome which doesn't mix well with ADHD. It puts the body and mind in a bad place. I finally got around to going to the doctor and he recommended that I take Adderall 3 times a day. This has been such a benefit to my life. Not only do I have the energy to get out of bed I can now focus enough to get some daily life stuff done.	10	August 13, 2019	9
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	First prescribed it in grad school for ADD & depression. Worked wonders. Only downside is I became very reliant on it. Was stuck between the two evils of being a depressed zombie (w/o taking it) and feeling like a happy, motivated, focused person (on Adderall). Eventually stopped taking and failed out of grad school. Work was hard, always late, made stupid mistakes, & couldn’t complete tasks. 3 years & 3 jobs later, I broke down and went back to a doctor who rediagnosed me with ADD, Anxiety, & Depression. I was reluctant to start back on Adderall and tried a few alternatives first. Everything made me feel even MORE exhausted; back on Adderall 30mg day; feel normal again. I have the motivation, energy, & focus to complete tasks. Only complaint is anxiety which I resolve w/ a low benzo & exercise. Remember, there’s no reason to be miserable if there’s a pill out there that can change your life.	7	August 10, 2019	103
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	"I've finally found it. - Mydayis it is that little reminder I never had; the missing piece of my conscience that was never there before to tell me ""stop mucking and go do the stuff you should be getting on with"""	7	August 5, 2019	31
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	This medicine initially seemed to work very well for me with improved concentration but after taking it for only 6 months I discontinued it due to anxiety levels being through the roof to the point where I couldn’t function. This was enhanced during social interactions of which is ironic because I know many people say they experience increased desire for social activities. A month after stopping medicine, I started experience psychotic symptoms of which have not subsided. I do not suggest this medicine.	4	August 3, 2019	18
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I'm 19. I've tryed a lot of ADHD medication (I'm from Canada so I have less option than the US). Concerta, Biphentin, Vyvanse. With all these medication I've experienced sides effects, or, in the case of Vyvanse, I was not focused enough. And now I'm on Adderall XR and I can tell you than is the best ADHD medication I've tried. I feel like I can multi-task like Vyvanse but more focus, and this focus make all the difference. I don't feel a lot of sides effects, and they are nothing if I compare with Concerta or Biphentin. and Adderall XR is one of the only ADHD medication with generic availability in Canada!	9	August 2, 2019	23
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Adderall X R 30mg in the morning along with 5mg of Adderall in the early afternoon seem to help my mood and condition dramatically. If you are ADHD I recommend talking with your psychiatrist.	10	August 2, 2019	24
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Started off with  Adderall  5 mg IR twice daily.  Overall, this is a very low dose.  I have found it was more effective and safer to take it every couple of days.  At least for me.  I have tried 40mg and 60mg before so I am very aware of how intense it can be.  If you take it every day you will end up increasing the dosage.  Try to use it sparingly and try doing activities that produce dopamine naturally like exercise or walking and listening to music.  This will help you feel healthier while taking it.  Overall I think it is helpful but definitely feels unnatural and can't believe they give speed to children.  	5	July 30, 2019	35
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I asked my doctor about Mydayis because it lasts 16 hours.    The first week I was so calm, never been so calm in my life, even with antidepressants. I was able to focus during conversations. I organized my desk (a little). Cleaned my car out (a little). My second week i was still focusing but I couldn't eat. I was repulsed by anything other than fruits, vegetables, cereal. But then I felt dizzy...sick to my stomach. My eyes seem to move involuntarily   Nystagmus )mand I got the worst eye strain I've ever had. My neck muscles felt extremely tight and I just kept massaging my neck trying not to panic. I tried to tough it out for the next 2 days but could not. It's been day 2 days since I quit taking it and my eyes are still involuntarily moving a little. I had big hopes for this med but this is how it worked it for me and I was only taking 12.5 mg.  I just needed to let everyone know about this possibility because I couldn't find any info about it. It would probably be considered a tic.	3	July 27, 2019	28
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Diagnosed ADD 18 y/o, on and off Adderall IR since then. Too high a dose causes psychosis...be forewarned. I used to be on 30mg 3x/day, now I'm leary of taking more than 2.5mg 2x/day. Maybe it builds up in the brain, so be sure to take breaks from it often. I notice the side effects outweigh the benefits at higher doses....irritability, zombie-like come-down. My insurance only covers this and Ritalin, so I'm stuck with bad side-effects.	4	July 23, 2019	19
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	"Adderall is literally the only THING Period that I have tried that has improved my life in the slightest (I have ADD/Treatment-Resistant Depression ) - I got my Bachelors degree in Health & Psychology, I tried EVERY supplement herb, nootropic, etc. I'm commenting here is because of all the people saying how it drained them, or over time began making them feel worse - you need to educate yourself - one of the most important being, be SURE to be supplementing with TYROSINE, literally daily (tyrosine converts into Dopamine - like how 5-HTP converts to Serotonin) just like how SSRI's eventually ""poop out"" and just stop working (because they've used up the bodies natural serotonin) Adderall will eventually ""poop out"" on you, stop working, yet even worse when this happens, the more you take the WORSE you feel because its like revving an engine with no gasoline left in it!!! Theres plenty more to look into but even just taking Tyrosine makes a HUGE difference!"	8	July 19, 2019	97
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Adderall is all fun and games until you become addicted and try to stop taking it. I loved and still love Adderall, just like all of the positive reviews here - it works like nothing else, but I will never take it again.  I quit Adderall June of 2018 and it was the worst thing I ever went through - everything you read online about stimulant withdrawal is true x100. It’s almost impossible to successfully wean off of this medication. I went cold turkey 3x before I was finally successful.  It took me months to feel “normal” again.  During this time my life went downhill and I started up again December 2018 at a low dose, which before I knew it increased back to me 40mg dose.  I just quit Adderall again because I will be trying to get pregnant at the end of this year and it was once again a battle but I managed to do it. I will NEVER go back on this medication. Ever. It took me 2 hard lessons to realize how bad this medication is for you and your brain.	1	July 17, 2019	3
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I do not recommend anyone taking Adderall. I was unable to eat or sleep while taking this medication. It caused severe stunting of my growth.	1	July 17, 2019	8
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	"I have always known that I had ADD. However, I was in grad school, and I was studying for up to 10-12 hours a day. I found myself reading and re-reading and was having a hard time retaining information, because I couldn't stay focused. I would study for hours. Long story short, for my master's degree, I had to take practice timed test for NP boards, I failed it. My instructor told me to get tested for ADHD,  and get on medications. I did, and it was the best thing I have ever done, and wish I did it sooner, it cut my studying by half, because I'm very focused. I didn't have to request extra time for my NP boards, and I passed with time to spare. I have no side effects; incr. HR, BP, I eat and exercise, and don't take it late in afternoon to avoid insomnia. I only take it when I study and not everyday.  I believe it's about making the drug work for you and not let the drug control you.  Medication ""holidays"" are great to do."	10	July 13, 2019	36
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	If it wasn’t for Adderall I would be a basket case no questions asked. I'm 55 been on it since 2014 on an everyday basis. I'll take a day off every so often, but it's a rare occasion. My Blood Pressure is 122/74- pulse 64 when moving around normally. Resting my BP is lower along with the pulse rate. If you are relatively healthy heart wise no problems. I know one guy who's pushing 76 years old and he's still taking his prescribed dosage.	10	July 8, 2019	35
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	My son developed tics and we stopped the Adderall medication. Tics remain and one day he hit his head until no hair was there. He also now has blood in his stool no one can explain. Hmmm well permanent  damage isn’t worth the education we are providing now. I would rather buy a franchise than a college degree.	1	July 7, 2019	5
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been taking ADHD Medications for years. I have found that the Generic  Adderall ( Extended Release 20 mg) by Amneal Pharmaceuticals LLC. (CAPSULES STAMPED g454) ARE NOT as effective as other brands	2	July 2, 2019	7
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I've been on and off Adderall IR for the last year. When I'm on Adderall the first 3 months is amazing! I feel highly attentive and motivated. I have to take sleep meds because I'm so wired. The negative is the crash I feel by 6pm. It's like I transform into Angry Smurf - no longer talkative or cheerful and forgot about sex -- my libido shut down. My greatest battle is with food.  I am constantly hungry and when I eat the meds seem to lose its potency therefore causing me to skip meals. I built a tolerance rather quickly on this stuff and it lost its efficacy. IN ANY CASE, DO NOT INCREASE YOUR DOSAGES. Instead take a break from Adderall and try another drug for a couple of months.  This drug is not meant for long term use. Just few month. anything longer is just going to create a monster out of you.	6	July 1, 2019	17
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been taking 50mg of Mydayis for a few months now and I have been happy with my experience on this medicine. I have been on several regimens, including Vyvanse 70 + Dexedrine 10 booster, Adderall XR + Dexedrine 10 booster, Adderall xr + adderall 10 booster, Focalin XR, etc but I decided to give Mydayis a go since my new insurance has it covered on its formulary ($50 a month copay). Like others have said this drug runs in the background but I find it much more consistent and wayyyy longer acting than Adderall XR and even longer than Vyvanse, which only lasted 6 hours max for me. I take it at 5:30am and feel the medicine until about 5pm (~10 hours give or take). Mydayis less anxiety-provoking but I still feel like my ADHD symptoms are controlled around the clock and yet at the same time I feel more like myself than I did strung out on the other medicines. If you’re looking for an option that lasts a long while and your insurance will help pay for it I, think it’s a good option.	10	May 1, 2021	0
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have received my second refill of generic Adderall XR 20 mg made by Mallinckrodt and I am extremely unhappy with it. It is not at all effective. I have been on the non-generic Adderall XR for years without issue.	1	April 29, 2021	1
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have taken Adderall XR and short acting for 25 years and I got this new XR 30MG the other day Lannett and it made me tired, heart racing, BP accelerated and did NOTHING to help me focus. I contacted the pharmacy and my Dr and he's trying to switch me to another brand because this is a joke. awful..	1	April 26, 2021	6
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Just started taking adderall XR 10mg after learning I had been mis-diagnosed for 15+ years as either bi-polar, major depressive disorder and social anxiety. I finally found a psychiatrist that really dug deep and concluded I was not bi polar but I suffered from adult ADHD (33 year old male). It makes total sense as I read more about ADHD. I had been on every possible anti-depressant, anti psychotic MDD etc and was just done with meds. I was diagnosed as a child and teen but thought “ I’d grow out of it” and apparently never did it just got worse. I feel that so many people are mis-diagnosed it’s almost unbelievable. My theory and the doctor also said that if you take the medication and it calms you and your racing thoughts that that’s a tell tail sign that you do indeed suffer from ADHD, it’s not just a childhood/school era problem, it disrupts your life, marriage everything. I’m on day 2 and it’s like a light switch has been turned on and I can relax and not be manic.	9	April 25, 2021	4
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been on and off generic Adderall for many years. Currently, I have been prescribed 30 mg twice a day. For the last couple of months, it's been a nightmare. It's been on backorder and then changed the generic name from amphetamine salts combo to amphetamine/ dextroamphetamine combo. This is only because I have had severe headaches, extreme fatigue, and a loss of motivation. My ADHD has been out of the roof. It's frustrating because I feel like I did before taking any generic Adderall. I have even been concerned that maybe I was receiving a placebo rather than the actual medication. That's probably far-fetched, but it's been such a decline for me. There is something missing from this generic form and it is the essential thing that is needed to control my ADHD. I have even gained a lot of weight over the past two months. Hopefully, something will give, I can't imagine it affecting people like this and nothing changing.	3	April 19, 2021	8
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	This pill does not work like any Adderall that I have experienced. There is neither the focus or the energy bump that is typically associated with the two most therapeutic aspects of the formulation. The vast majority of time I feel equally as sleepy and unfocused as I did when I took it.    I am an experienced user of this positive life-changing medication. The patients that us this medication are in a bad position when company’s that make inferior generic medications are allowed distribution rights through equally as corrupt retail pharmaceutical outlets seeking to make a few pennies extra per script, on the back of patients whose experienced opinion is rarely considered.	2	April 17, 2021	2
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have taken ADHD meds many years. Adderall XR is the ADHD med that works the best for me. I am taking a generic manufactured by Lannett. It by far has worked the best for me with the reason(s) being is the smoothness, the come up is very quick, and it does it's job perfectly.   To reiterate, Lannett is very smooth with a quick come up, and last long enough most days.	9	April 15, 2021	4
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	If anyone else is having a terrible time with the new Lannett generic adderall you can report this to the FDA.  I have been having crippling headaches, stomach aches, and the medication doesn’t even feel like it works!!! I get tired after I take it and then can’t sleep all night because of it. HORRIBLE. Google fda medwatch online reporting to fill in the form	1	April 9, 2021	37
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Right now I take 50mg Lamictal for my Bipolar and 7.5mg twice a day Adderall for ADHD. At first I wasn't sure Adderall was going to work for me, I was initially prescribed 20mg twice a day.  That dose ended up being way too high for me, It made be become manic and I felt really wired all the time.  I now take 7.5mg twice a day and have found it to be much better. I feel alert and focused throughout the day.  Some of the side effects I have had are weight loss, jaw clenching, and mild insomnia (I usually just take melatonin). Overall, Adderall has helped me a lot, I just had to find the right dosage.	8	April 8, 2021	0
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been on Adderall for several years and the Sandoz brand is TOXIC and HORRIBLE! At first it is like a sugar pill no effect and then dizziness, headache, feeling more confused, spaced out and mind blank, extreme fatigue. I can't believe this is on the market. FDA honestly needs to step up their game and monitor the generics. It is a up and down roller coaster with different manufactures each month. This is insane. They are robbing us blind in the pharmaceutical business. They give us something toxic or a placebo. What is happening to the medications now. Please do not take the Sandoz. Read the court documents about reviews on them and they came from the company. Making themselves sound great as a pretend customer!! I can not believe how bad this medication from this manufacture is.	1	April 6, 2021	10
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Worked really well for the first week or so, but then really made me more irritable and gave me uncontrollable suicidal urges that ultimately sent me to the hospital. The suicidal urges stopped after dropping the medication.  I wouldn't recommend against the medication, I would just proceed with caution as the side effects can vary in intensity from person to person.	1	April 3, 2021	3
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been prescribed Amphetamine Salt Combo which has worked well(I have ADD and narcolepsy). Today I was given from RX, Amphetamine Aspertate, it make me fell kinda sickness. Was I given the wrong medicine. The prescription has not changed ?	7	April 1, 2021	3
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’ve been on Adderrall immediate release for at least 8 years, probably more. At first Adderrall gave me an intense high and made me very talkative. Very talkative. That lasted for a few days and after that each morning when I took it it gave me a euphoric feeling for about have the day. I wasn’t making impulsive decisions like I had in the past and my focus was razor sharp. I really enjoyed this drug for sometime but the last 3-5 years it’s just been the same old same old. I take it in the morning and have somewhat of a boost in energy and focus but after around 11am the effects of the medication just wears off. I wind up feeling irritable, decent level of focus if I’m busy at work, and just downright not very social with people. This week I’m going to see my P.A. and hopefully get on Vyvanse which I was encouraged by many to try before jumping on Adderrall. Vyvanse is more expensive but I’m ready to feel more focused and more myself.	5	March 28, 2021	4
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	This review is for generic Adderall XR - amphetamine/dextroamphetamine. I've experienced wildly different effects from different manufacturers. Some days it didn't work. Some days it worked great. But I got severe debilitating headaches that lasted 24/7 and didn't go away using ibuprofen. Went to neurologist and got an MRI. If I could push past the side effects it did work well but for only about 4-5 hours after kicking in (which took about an hour). Needed a booster of IR in the afternoon, so eventually I couldn't deal with the headaches and switched to IR completely. Headaches gone almost immediately. I still get them with IR but not anywhere near as often or as bad.	6	March 23, 2021	1
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	"I've tried several ADHD meds and Mydayis has definitely been the best for me. I'm on the lowest dose and it starts working 20-30 minutes after I take it. I'm then able to be productive and direct my focus easily, compared to other meds (eg-Adderall) which gave me a burst of intense focus that I had no control over. The transitions are barely noticeable and it really helps maintain consistent energy levels. After wearing off, it's a very natural ""I've worked all day and now I'm ready to relax before bed"" feeling (no crash). I also noticed it significantly helps manage my depression-something no other ADHD med has done. The only downsides: (1) it does reduce my appetite a lot and (2) it only lasts about 9-10 hours on my current dose (12.5mg), but higher doses (25mg+) give me headaches. It's not perfect, but the positives definitely outweigh the negatives for me. Lastly-you don't know how it'll affect you, so don't let reviews scare you away if you/your doc think it might help."	9	March 21, 2021	4
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I was diagnosed with ADHD at age 17 and only really started taking stimulant medication after I had turned 20 last year. I was originally trying out varying doses of IR but started trying XR in the past few months.  Overall: Hit or miss for me. It does help with my focus, but the side effects and how much it helps varies pretty drastically depending on the day. Biggest side effects are dehydration, lack of appetite, potentially crashing at night (normal). I also feel a bit uncomfortable sometimes (anxiety-ish twitchy feeling) but that's not very common.  The mallinckrodt brand I was switched to recently seems maybe a bit more hit or miss honestly I can't really tell that much of a difference (unlike people on opioids who swear that mallinckrodt is awful). I'm on 25mg for now and I'm gonna keep seeing how I feel in the coming weeks. Helps with ADHD no doubt, but do be weary of the side effects.	7	March 16, 2021	2
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I took Mydayis 37.5 mg for 2 years. I just recently ran out and decided to wait a week to refill. I cannot believe the change in myself! While on it I became withdrawn and too focused on 1 specific thing. I cut out people and ruined my small business. I didn't feel human! I can't explain the feeling but now that I haven't taken it in a week I feel like myself again! I was just flesh living day by day on mydayis! I will NEVER touch it again! Please tell me there's others out there with similar experiences	1	March 12, 2021	5
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	"I have been taking teva 20mg adderall from 06-19 when they disappeared. I had already suffered from side effects from other generics due to CVS giving me a different generic a few times without consent or being informed. I did the whole google wormhole for a few months before finally seeing a random comment about ""INACTIVE"" ingredients and how this person suffered terrible side effects across multiple generic medications with this same ""INACTIVE"" ingredient. Being on multiple meds myself and having autoimmune and neuro disorders it affected my mental health knowing something wasn't right and just not grasping why & not understanding. That random comment changed everything for me ""INACTIVE"" does not equal no effect.  Teva not being an option then and now not at all I use Mallinckrodt and Arubindo 20 mg. I find it helps to switch them every couple months or I take M in the morning and A in the afternoon depending on how my body is functioning. I tried SAndoz that was terrible side effects."	8	March 6, 2021	2
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	My 7 year old son is a first grader and was recently diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. He has been recommended Adderall for this but I am a bit reluctant to initiate its usage. I have a few reservations about how long it lasts in our system which I have heard can prove to be dangerous for a young kid. I have read multiple articles like these, but I am still not so sure. Seeing the number of experienced people here, please tell me if I should continue with it.		March 4, 2021	4
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	First time taking Alvogen generic amphetamine with dextroamphetamine 30mg. Been taking adderall for 2 years but always Teva generic. Oh my God, the Alvogen brand has made me feel so sick. All over severe headache, nauseous, vomiting, diarrhea. I feel awful. No focus, no energy, can't keep anything down, running to the bathroom.	1	February 27, 2021	8
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Been taking adderall for years. Until the had me try a white stop sign shaped one by mallinckrodt since there was an adderall shortage at my Walgreens. mallinckrodt amphetamine/dextroamphetamine shouldn’t even be labeled as amphetamine/dextroamphetamine it should just be sold as a caffeine pill because all it does is wake you up subtlety. It doesn’t help with focus whatsoever. I’ve already filed a complaint with the FDA and recommend everyone else do the same	1	February 25, 2021	20
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I take the 10 mg amphetamine with dextroamphetamine by Teva and it works great, better than the 15 mg.in my opinion. I see others mentioning generics by Alogen and Mallinckrodt here. Well I take a couple of other medications manufactured by these 2, on and off, most times it's Mallickrodt. Let me tell you, this is the WORST drug manufacturer on the market. The Alogen is junk too. I've been on a few medical chat sites just to see what I can find out about Mallinckrodt and see if others felt the same way and they absolutely do! Literally 100's of people have complained to the co. itself and to the FDA. This has been going on for a solid 5 years at least & the stuff is STILL pure unadulterated JUNK.	7	February 21, 2021	25
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Switched from Concerta to Mydayis for the longer duration mechanism Mydayis offers. Was started on 25mg of Mydayis. ADD symptoms improved but I experienced dry mouth, dizziness, heart increase, and appetite decrease which subsided after the first week. Second week I felt like the dose was not effective. Doc switched me to 37.5mg of the mydayis and so far symptoms of ADD improved but side effects are rough. Dry mouth, headache, dizziness, lack of appetite, increased anxiety. I’m on day 4 or 5 so hoping the side effects subside when my body adjusts to the higher dose... fingers crossed.	6	February 20, 2021	4
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I am currently on Adderall XR 30MG, and it has changed so many different aspects of my life, including depression.  I was prescribed Adderall because I was about to be terminated from my job. Back to the drug, I take it around 6am everyday, and found that my overall mood has changed. I am not as emotional as I was before, yet I am still able to express my feelings when necessary without the full breakdowns. I have been dealing with Major Depressive Disorder, and this medication has alleviated most of those feelings.  However, the medication has not been a miracle drug, and it contains no magic! For me, ADD has always been there. For me, it took me to be 36 years old to finally realize it was time to visit a psychiatrist, regardless of all the negative stigmas; I was glad I did, because it gave me many suspected answers, rather than self diagnosing situations.	9	February 15, 2021	17
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’ve taken adderall for years. I used to be on Lannett brand and Walgreens recently switched to TEVA. I had my script switched from CVS to Walgreens because it was closer to me. I have been on it for 3 months and the side effects are TERRIBLE.  I clench my teeth so bad my teeth have broken, I am severely depressed, I can’t find happiness in literally anything. I don’t feel motivated at all. If anything I feel less motivated to get out of bed. My skin is dry, my eyes are sinking in and I get terrible migraines. My anxiety is so bad I’m anti social, and I thought I had a stroke because of side effects. I’m 25. Just don’t take it		February 13, 2021	7
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I take two 30 mg pills a day for ADHD and it has really made a huge difference in my life. I am able to focus on one task at a time and complete it. Works great for giving me the motivation I sometimes lack. Only issue is that when I was given the white or peach ones, they did not seem to work as well as the pink ones. Talked to doctor about it and she added to my prescription to only receive the pink ones. Curious if anyone else has had this issue	9	February 10, 2021	37
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	ALVOGEN INC has got me all messed up. I've taken ADHD meds since 1st grade and I'm 32 now so I'm very confident in my ability to distinguish between generics that work & don't and why. For the past 4 years I've used the same CVS location to fill my Adderall tab 30mg generic the past two times though I received a pill that looked different thinking okay whatever this happens from time to time it is just a different manufacturer no big deal. I was wrong. I have had insanely high blood pressure increases, trouble sleeping, hardly any focus, SEVERE anxiety like where is feel like I can't breathe suddenly especially when I try to sleep, shaky hands, VERY noticeable heart palpitations, diarrhea, headaches and  weird emotional ups & downs. I've been vegan for 3 months now at first I was seeing a steady decrease in blood pressure but as soon as I started taking this new generic I'm topping out at 161/111 at the doctor a few days ago which is just absolutely bonkers and terrifying	2	February 9, 2021	9
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’ve taken TEVA adderall 20 mg IR for the past 2+ years. It worked greatly for my ADD & as an anti-depressant. HOWEVER, it has changed! Starting July 2020, the TEVA tablet was completely different. It was no longer sweet, the consistency was harder & the efficacy was compromised. I can take it & fall asleep hours later & there is ZERO anti-depressant effect. In fact, it deepens my depression.  I will submit a report to the FDA & I encourage everyone else to. Also, please research the complaints of TEVAs other generics. I’m not sure what to try next. I tried the Sandoz and it was actually worse. I received the hideous Zydus once-which gave me a migraine & intensely aching back.I believe it’s manufactured out of this country.  This experience has made me question ALL generic medications.   Please start researching yours & refuse to take these.  I tried switching to name brands but my ins. refuses to pay.	2	February 8, 2021	11
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Have used a generic for about 6 years now worked for me except it has turned me into a teeth grinder I do it all the time and now my teeth are worn to the point they are ruined.  My doctor said he never heard of that side effect but a recent visit to a dentist to try to fix my teeth I was told they see this all the time and this grinding may never go away. I need to find something that works without these side effects	6	February 4, 2021	9
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’ve been in this medication for almost a year . And it change my life in good way.

ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been taking Teva amphetamine/dextroamphetamine (adderall generic) for quite sometime for ADHD. In the last year, I noticed right away something was off. First was the obvious color. The Teva that has always worked for me with no problems (that was being weaned out in 2019) was as follows..  peach color and sweet, easy to swallow and not gag on. Teva now, is orange. The sweet taste that made it bearable to take has changed completely. My focus, clarity, motivation, and concentration has been/is immensely effected by the new ingredient change. (I don't have it at all)  My overall mental health, has declined quickly. It has caused my mood to completely change, headaches are constant, and upset stomach. All of this, and they don't even work. I struggle everyday now. Less main ingredient and more fillers means more pills can be produced, which means more money in the manufacturer's pocket..... Mental health should be top priority, especially being consistent with and not changing the ingredients.	1	January 17, 2021	51
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	This month is the first time I received sandoz adderall ER and it doesn't seem to work very well for me. Mallinckrodt doesn't seem to work too well for me either. I think Teva seems to work the best for me; even better than the name brand for adderall.	6	January 17, 2021	2
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have suffered with ADHD since I was a young kid, I got diagnosed at the youngest age possible and I never got any help for it by my old doctor.  With my new doctor, he gave me Adderall XR to start out with 10 and than up it to 20 within a week if not effective.   I am on 20 MG now and it has changed my life, I failed school and life because I couldn't pay attention and now not only can I pay attention but this has also helped as my ADHD had caused Depression/Anxiety also OCD.	10	January 15, 2021	14
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Generic Adderall varies significantly depending on mfg. Reason being, the FDA says the mfg only has to “demonstrate” it “works in the same way “ as the brand-name. i.e. generic ingredients do  Not have to be same which is why so many don’t work and/or make people feel sick. My experience, the only generic that works like the brand-name is Prasco, which acquired Teva’s generic xr in 2016.  Few pharmacies use Prasco as their generic because it’s more expensive!  My Dr specifies “Prasco generic only” on my prescription for D-Amphetamine ER 30MG Salt combo. By law, the pharmacy must comply if Prasco is one of their overall suppliers. My insurance changed so I called Prasco to see if they sell to Costco. They do. Just takes a day or 2 for the pharmacist to order and fill my script. Walgreens used Prasco as their generic until recently. Now it’s Mallinckrodt which just filed for bankruptcy to settle a slew of opioid lawsuits. It’s all about $		January 8, 2021	60
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	The adderall name brand is 2-3 times better than generic adderall XR. The FDA should be inspecting these generic companies and make sure they are getting as high of quality ingredients. I urge anyone in generics to try real adderall for a month then decided for yourself. Decide to report the generics because we should be able to get a cheaper still 90$ for generic compared to $220+ for name brand.	10	January 7, 2021	18
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’m a doctor with ADHD. I’ve been on the generics to cut costs during tough times but I insist on the name brand adderall. No only is it smoother it lasts longer and helps even more than the generics. It’s a shame that cost is a bearing on necessary prescriptions and that generic are so much weaker and poorer quality. Generic adderall needs to step it up they have quality issues and their recipe is somehow flawed.	5	January 7, 2021	25
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I've only been taking it for 3 days but I can understand now when people say they feel it running in the background. So far no side effects other than appetite loss. I do feel energy from this but not like Adderall there's no anxiety tied to the energy its more like motivation than energy. One thing I've noticed is I like to always be doing something that is productive in some way. It's not the type of energy you get and use to dance or workout you feel driven to get things done.  It last for the whole 16 hours which surprised me I'm an ultra rapid metabolizer. I have no crash on this like I did with Adderall. I'm just waiting for my period now to see how the cramps are and giving the medicine more time to see if I do have any side effects, so far none but no appetite.	10	January 3, 2021	11
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I've been taking dextroamp-amphet ER 15mg once a day for roughly 3 months now and it's helped me greatly until 2 weeks ago and it's as if I cut my dose by 3/4! Is this normal and what dose, frequency, and type of adderall should I change to? I've heard about generic vs name brand, so what do the best ones look like?	6	December 30, 2020	1
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I've been prescribed adderall for 10yrs+ and without it mentally and physically I would be worse. I do have soreness, achy body, etc but have other health problems. Adderall has ROTTED MY TEETH OUT. Being 42 years old, fear ability to retain with out medicine as I age. I have severe withdrawal, to include extreme fatigue, severe constipation. I need the Adderral and helps some as without it life would be more difficult. All and all I would not manage without it very well but it is less effective as been taking for years. Take care and God Bless All. Be Safe!	7	December 24, 2020	10
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Regarding the post by DrKatz on 11/7/2020:.  I too take the 20 mg salt combo- manufactured by Teva, and have been on that specific brand for two and a half years.  I can definitely concur that something has changed with their product.   I am on a prescription of 80 mg a day and I too noticed a difference in taste, consistency of the pill itself, and it not working as well as it used to.  I am aware of a recall May 22nd by Teva for a few of their doses- the 20mg pill being one of them.   Thinking placebo, I inspected the pill closely: the depression level of the imprint is different, slight change in the oblong shape, the edging* (*like the cut/side profile of floor boards) and thickness + curvature.   The taste difference (bitter) I noticed in August. October back to normal but currently (Nov.) the taste changed again- however this time with a much greater chemical profile- like bactine or rubbing alcohol, more crumbly and not working as well for either my ADHD or narcolepsy.	8	November 15, 2020	29
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’ve been on Adderall XR 20 mg since October 6th 2020. I have to say this medication is life changing and your psychiatrist, doctor or whatever will try and find the right dosage for you. I’m 22 years old, Male and I noticed the medication working within an hour, I’m about 220 pounds 5’8 and despite that it still kicked in relatively fast. The side affects I notice the most are as follows dry mouth, appetite suppression, some irritability, and insomnia on occasion. Adderall XR for me last anywhere from 8-12 hours, if it wears off the medical professional in most cases will add Adderall IR to take in the afternoon, since upping the dose of XR will not increase duration only the intensity of the medication itself. ADHD medication is all about finding what’s right for YOU, don’t give up if it doesn’t get manageable or fixed after the first try.	9	November 8, 2020	42
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have always used Teva Adderall IR because I have had horrible experiences with other generic, including inconsistency and lack of potency.  Understand that I have taken Teva Adderall 20MG tablets over five years, thus it would less difficult for someone like me to detect subtle changes in its effects.  I have noticed the following, and this started around September 2020.  Teva generic Adderall tablets seem (and this is very subtle) smaller in size. Second: Teva is known for its slight sweet taste. It is almost as if that is completely  gone... I’m certainly not saying that added anything to it, but I’m saying it’s an indicator  of some sort of formula change.  Finally, although the 20MG tablet is small, it used to be easy to half the tablet. Recently they just crumble. To summarize, I have also noted a very marked decrease in efficacy.	7	November 7, 2020	26
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Adderall XR is Life changing (positively). I went from being massively distractable and procrastinate constantly to getting things done. I'm not just referring to school work or office work. I mean just showing up on time to meet up with friends. Not getting instantly bored with family.  I truly love it!   --- Quick warning, take it as your doctor recommends! So much of the bad press comes from people abusing the drug.  Likewise, if you're able, take a day off now and then. Perhaps on days when you don't need to work or do much. It's sort of like coffee/tea/caffeine in that sense. Fine if you do take it everyday, but probably best if you give your mind/body a rest from it now & then.  Just like running or exercise, you need light or rest days each week to really get the most from the workout.	10	November 6, 2020	34
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	My grades instantly went from the 60s and 70s to 90s and 100s and for once I felt like I had control over my life. The side effects were pretty bad and inconsistent though, so I had to go from 20 to 15 mg.	9	November 4, 2020	18
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	The Adderal dose my doctor prescribed didn't seem to work that great(20 mg twice a day)  One day I had it after my oatmeal and it was more effective so after that I just scrunched up the pill like I did with oatmeal, but I didn't put it on anything.  I just took it like that. Works great!  Much more motivation to get tasks done so I can finish more!  Maybe you could try that if it sees not enough to work.  I use Sandoz.	10	October 11, 2020	20
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Adderall XR was originally prescribed to me for ADD, but it worked best as a terrific antidepressant.  However, now that I've been on it for 20 straight years at 40-80 mg. Daily, it has very little antidepressant effect now. It's Adderall burnout -- apparently it strips the brain of dopamine -- the feel-good hormone.        I still have to take it just to do anything at all each day.  The worst effect is insomnia -- no matter how early I take it.  It keeps me up for 24 hours unless I finally have to take Seroquel for sleep.  Seroquel is the only thing that will knock out Adderall XR.  But I hate it because it makes me so damn sluggish in the morning, awful.        I cannot believe it's 2020, and there is still no decent antidep medication available,	8	October 1, 2020	31
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	The last 9 months generic “Zydus” was the only brand of amphetamine/dextroamphetamine available in my area. I noticed pretty nasty side effects beginning 45 minutes after consumption. I’ve never felt depression so severely before taking Zydus. Teva/Barr has returned. Felt a night and day difference the first day. Hope Zydus gets banned for the safety of us all.	1	September 23, 2020	20
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Stressed and depressed and always angry.	7	September 21, 2020	23
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I switched over to Mydayis in hope of finding something that could last the entire day. My days are usually nonstop for approx 16 hours. I started at the lowest dose and went up to the 50mg after 3 weeks. Gave it a few more weeks in hopes that it would work like how we wanted it to. The negative side effects outweigh the positives. The first thing I noticed was ejaculatory anhedonia. It led to an unplanned pregnancy before I caught it. The rest included falling behind in classes and not being able to keep up at work. Felt lazy and not wanting to do anything. It was like being unmedicated all over again!	4	September 21, 2020	8
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Generic Adderall:  TEVA vs. ALVOGEN “All generic adderall is NOT the same trust me!...... I don’t care what your physician or pharmacist may say.“  I’ve taken Adderall for nearly 25 plus years for ADD.  WHY? it works twice as good ask anyone whose taken different brands before. For the BEST quality and most potent adderall on the market is made by a company called TEVA.  Even pharmacist tell me when they run out of TEVA and must use ALVOGEN their patients complain because the pharmacies cannot keep TEVA in stock because the consumers know it’s the best and most effective for ADD and ADHD.	1	September 15, 2020	133
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have taken both Adderall and its generic(amphetamine/dextroamphetamine) for over 16 years for my Adult Attention Deficit Disorder. I have found that the original Adderall has the best effectiveness and in these last 4 tears Teva [still oval, peach/orange color] working the best for my A.D.D. Pills made by Mallinkrodt I only get by mistake, and still act like a placebo in May 2020. Dose: 20mg. X 2 daily.		August 25, 2020	24
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I do not like this formula. I have been on various generics for years and did not feel like this 10 mg did anything. Unfortunately, I've already filled this prescription and am stuck with this medication.	1	August 24, 2020	7
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been taking Adderall for most of my adult life and Walgreens always carried the generic version that worked best for me but recently they changed who they get it from now and the new amphetamine / dextroamphetamine from Lannett MFG SUCK!  They do not work at all - actually the worst next to the  YELLOW ROUND Mp 447's, PINK ROUND Cor 136's, or OCTAGON WHITE ONES.   The TEVA amphetamine/dextroamphetamine Peach Oval B 974's are the ones that work best for me and now I don' t know how to get them - Help..	10	June 16, 2020	94
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	My concern in taking generic Adderall IR for several years is the effect is has on my heart  When I take it, at the prescribed dose,  I most always have sinus tachycardia  (a heart rate above 100 beats per minute)  I also have noticed that it effects bladder emptying....and my urinary stream seems slower (and I am fairly young) and I am not usually able to completely empty my bladder.	6	June 10, 2020	26
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Since the shortage for about 3 months I've been taking generic Zydus 20mg. How do these drugs pass inspection? I think a couple pixie sticks would work better. I wonder if generic adderall from any manufacturer will ever get better. I think charging over $5.00 for this rubbish should be criminal.	1	June 7, 2020	40
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	This medication amphetamine/dextroamphetamine has made me feel VERY JITTERY and sick to my stomach! I take generic TEVA brand orange tab 30 mg. The pharmacy didn’t have any of the TEVA brand so they gave me generic U31 tablet - Aurolife Pharma, LLC brand. This is horrible! People take time off work to be seen by doctor, get put on meds for a reason, spend money for the appointment and meds, all the time you spend doing this & it can’t be returned back to Walmart to get my right medicine because “it’s against the law” supposedly! Even when I have the entire prescription (minus one) to give them back. Why make people feel like this when they do so much to try and make life easier being on their meds. I don’t have insurance so my doc visit is almost $100 & medicine is around $60 every month. My 7 year old daughters meds were switched as well. I’m scared to even give her medicine! How can Walmart just give you a different brand that you’ve never taken and not tell me before I leave it’s different!?	1	June 5, 2020	67
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I am a male in my thirties. Adderall is the third drug I tried to tread ADHD after doing trials on Vyvanse and Concerta. Vyvanse worked but did not last long enough and I had bad crashing (headache, exhaustion). Concerta did not work for me at all, made me lethargic and even more distracted.  Adderall at 20mg a day gives me energy to focus on work and my kids. It lasts me until sometime in the evening. I have trouble sleeping some nights on it, other than that the side effects are negligible.	8	May 3, 2020	43
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Activist Dextramp-amphet ER (30 mg.) [ generic for Adderall ]  is HORRIBLE. NOT effective. Causes nausea. HORRIBLE. I have taken this drug for over 3 years and I know what it is supposed to do.	1	April 30, 2020	40
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Adderall is very useful but recently I was ignorant and thought it would be okay to take a little extra at night to help clean my house. I took a bigger extra dose then I should have and a few hours later I felt pretty awful. I am very productive and more positive on the right dose of this med, so I recommend trying it or Desoxyn, because it is said to have fewer side effects like anxiety and panic and irritability post dose. Like all meds, Adderall is a blessing when dosed right and a curse when dosed incorrectly. I noticed that I paced around a bit when on it but I didn’t feel that anxious. It isn’t fun and enjoyable to take a big dose, don’t do it. God made everything to be used in moderation and it is much better for the whole society when we obey the wise instructions of our doctors and leaders. Be careful, obey your doctor, and may God bless you all to succeed in your treatment plans and in your lives. Amen	8	March 18, 2020	74
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	These batches have to improve. I can't even focus on anything and have narcolepsy.	1	March 10, 2020	35
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Recently changed pharmacies and didn't realize that there can be quite a difference between generics. For 4 years I’ve taken adderall 2x day, 10 mg. Never any problems until I switched pharmacies to save $.  Elite Pharma is who makes this new one and it is NOT GOOD.   I am lethargic, unable to focus, quite sleepy.  It’s as if I haven’t even taken anything.  Incredibly frustrating as I am not even half way through this months supply.	1	March 7, 2020	50
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	The generic manufacturer of amphetamine & dextroamphetamine, Sandoz, is the only one that works for me. This month the manufacturer is Northstar and last month Aurobindo, and they are garbage. They don’t help AT ALL with my focus. Zero.  I am irritable. I am getting nothing done and my anxiety is sky high. I am going to stop taking these brands and ask pharmacy for Sandoz.  I complained to the FDA and urge others to do so as well. This is ridiculous.	1	March 3, 2020	70
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Adderall has worked great for me when taken as needed. When I was in my early 20’s and taking it daily I built up a dependence that lead to terrible withdrawals as it is very addictive. (Learned the hard way and never want to go through that again!)  I will usually only take this when my ADHD symptoms are unbearable and my work/personal life starts to become affected. We are talking maybe 1-4 tablets max per month.  It really does help with focus and energy, and I find that one 10-20mg dose is usually enough and I feel good for several days after the dose without any withdrawals or dependence issues.

ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Laura, CVS in Kansas City and probably elsewhere exclusively carry SANDOZ. With goodrx my 60 tablets of 20mg are 28$	9	February 22, 2020	32
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	If you're taking for ADHD please note there are a lot of side effects, having said this, they are sometimes serious so take note to talk to your doctor. If you get cold fingers or toes, make sure to consult your doctor as it's a syndrome that can be prevented.  It does help with focus, it helps with impulse control, it helps with a general overall euphoric feeling and it can cause you to lose a lot of weight. Be sure to eat, EAT, don't shake your head, you know I'm talking to you. Eat and stay hydrated it causes you to urinate a LOT, make sure to supplement what you are losing. It will cause tremors, shakes, and irritability, again, eat food. Make sure to stick to a 2000 calorie diet AT LEAST. May cause muscle fatigue and extreme soreness, stay hydrated, make sure of this.  Some say it causes better grades in school, well, to an extent. It just makes you write a lot. Eat Eat Hydrate And maybe take melatonin to help promote rest. I warned and entertained you.	7	February 21, 2020	97
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	My daughter developed tardive dyskinesia, a permanent drug-induced movement disorder, while on Adderall. If your kid has ODD, stay away from all stimulates; they are most at-risk.	1	February 19, 2020	26
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I totally agree that the new A 79 generics are no good.  I mean they work a little bit, but I feel taking the same amount of the other oblong orange ones that taste like sweet we’re way better.  These taste like nasty chalk.    I’ve never had adderal brand though so I wouldn’t that difference.	3	February 19, 2020	25
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been on  adderal 15mg 2×daily  for 7 yrs it has completely change my life.  I  was always down, depressed, unmotivated, impulsive, always day dreaming, short attention span, no focus and couldn't sitting still. Adderal has given me a new happy life that I can enjoy and appreciate. Starting to think I need to go up to 20mg. I can feel I'm getting used to them. But without them I wouldn't get out of bed and would waste my life.I  think adderal is my miracle drug I have never been so grateful for a prescription drug	10	February 17, 2020	111
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I was diagnosed with ADHD combined type and have tried Ritalin and Focalin. Both weren't that great for me so my doctor prescribed me 10 mg of Adderall XR. Adderall has made me have better multitasking skills and helped me pay attention. It hasn't really helped with being hyper or being impulsive and has given me bad twitching eyes. It also has made my sleep schedule weird so watch out for that.	6	February 6, 2020	23
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Picked up amphetamine with dextroamphetamine medicine 1/24/20, bottle said Barr brand? But Teva tabs were inside. Teva bought Barr in 07. Before Teva bought out multiple companies and started using their ingredients within the last 2-3 years, they were great. Sandoz and Corepharma have been the only other decent makers, before they were bought out. I haven’t noticed a thing from picking these up 1/24. The worst medicine I’ve had from Teva in 8 years.	1	February 4, 2020	36
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	On 1/24/2020 I received Teva generic IR Adderall like I usually have for the last 7 years off and on (used to be good.) Except Barr was labeled on the bottle for the first time ever. Not sure why since Teva bought Barr in 07. Regardless it isn’t any better, by far the worst I’ve had of Teva. But every other company is pathetic. Brand works 10X better but 10X pricier. If the FDA enforced the rule of not less than 80% and no more than 125% concentrated effectiveness, that would be a first! The right MG of each dose might be regulated, but the fillers/inactive ingredients added is the big issue. 1-3 used to be in the old Barr/ Shire/ Sandoz/ Core and those worked fantastic. Every generic now has 5-8 fillers that make it less effective but also cause severe side effects. FDA could care less about small market drugs.	1	February 3, 2020	50
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Game changer. First DX by A pdoc: ADHD. What, no?  Yes.  I felt like I was only working with one puzzle piece and finding out about ADHD was like being given the other 999 pieces. At first Adderall IR didn’t seem to do much but I slowly realized it was like putting emotional and mental blinders on where I could see the rest of the world but mainly focus on the task at hand. Job saver for sure.  Since I have a high tolerance to meds XR saved me from constantly trying to remember to take next dose when I started crashing. Tops.	10	February 3, 2020	30
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have found the generic brand for Adderall is not effective as the brand name. The Epic brand caused me to have severe depression, blurred vision, headaches, very tired and no focus at all.  I’m trying to find a brand that is much like the name brand. Looking for suggestions if anyone can share please. Thanks	1	January 29, 2020	97
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I went to pharmacy to pick up my Adderall generic brand Zydus. I was told they was out of my brand. I was given the Epic brand. The Epic brand caused me to have severe depression and I stayed in bed, I’ve always been very energetic. I stopped taking it. I called the Pharmacist and reported the side effects I had. Pharmacist didn’t act surprised at all, stated we are out of your regular brand and probably won’t get it back in.	1	January 28, 2020	18
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Generics make me feel ill, sometimes headache, sometimes itching or hives.  Google where generics are made.	1	January 24, 2020	45
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	"I was so glad to see these posts.  Pharmacies are so rude to me. I switched to so many brands, but they say they are all alike, and say it doesn't matter which generic I get, because they're all the same.  My doctor, unfortunately, thinks the same.  I finally said to the pharmacy tech one day, ""I'm sure I'm not the only one, who would like certain generics."" She said, no, I'm the only one. I know this sounds crazy, but the blue 10mg of teva, don't seem to work like the 15mg of the peach teva, even if I cut one of the blue in half to make it 15mg."	8	January 23, 2020	92
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I was taking 15mg of generic Adderall  amphetamine / dextroamphetamine  for 3 months and by the end of the 3rd month I had 3 separate people tell me I didn't seem myself. I'm a regularly joyful and excited person but every emotion I had felt muted or stunted while on amphetamine/dextroamphetamine. I stopped talking it and 3 days later felt so much better. I was joyful again! Back to pinging all over the place but at least I'm happy doing it lol. I'm trying Concerta next.	4	January 21, 2020	3
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Ok so I have Both Narcolepsy/Extreme Fatigue & ADD. The generic forms of Adderall (amphetamine and dextroamphetamine) seem to be getting worse and worse. They are making them with obviously cheaper so-called similar ingredients but the new generic amphetamine and dextroamphetamine drugs just have bad side effects and don’t work for me at all or are far less effective. I don’t know if it is Teva brand that is making these cheap ineffective knock-offs that cause migraines & other side effects but they are definitely not working or decent. The generic form Amphetamine Salts works just fine for me but again I think when Teva took over and apparently used far cheaper Ingres there is definitely a disconnect because I don’t think Dextroamp-Amphetamin is a worthy generic form of Adderall but maybe just because Teva brand seems to be using incredibly cheap ingredients,	10	January 20, 2020	21
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I've had ONE DOSE.  Let me be clear.  I took one 25mg pill 6 hours ago and I'm so sleepy I can't see straight.  I slept 7.5 hours last night so I don't understand the drowsiness.	5	January 9, 2020	33
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’ve been on adderall for a few years now and it was life changing. I’ve always been prescribed a generic and have never had a problem until recently. I noticed that I was not getting the same benefit as I was previously and for months, tried to convince myself that it was in my head and then one month, I noticed everyday that I felt great! Looked at the pill imprint and what do you know - it was a different manufacture (Amneal) than the one I was taking. I started googling it and saw a lot of complaints for generic Adderall from Global Pharmaceutical. I’m talking to pharmacist today about it and requesting the generic by Amneal Pharmaceuticals. I thought they were all the same and it’s a shame that global can make these any less effective than what they should be. Is it so people go to their dr, say they don’t feel the effects of it and get an increase? Sounds like a big pharma thing to do. Trust your gut instinct because you’re the person who knows you best.	1	January 8, 2020	17
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	"I recently was given this new form of adderall from the pharmacy which was circular with just an ""A"" on one side... I did not like this new form of Adderall at all!! I assumed it would have the same effect as the typical oval shaped and it was completely different which is a little scary. It was very bitter and gross tasting unlike the football shaped one has a sweet note. It also disintegrated turning to powder immediately, as I attempted to break it in half (waste of product). I did not get any focus from it nor did I feel any different at all?? It did nothing! Then the next day got a horrible headache! I was talking with a friend who also mentioned getting the same thing recently. He mentioned having an extremely bad headache too the following day, so we now know it's from this form of adderall. I DO NOT LIKE IT. It should be pulled from the market honestly I don't know what the heck this rubbish  is but it is not adderall."	2	January 2, 2020	79
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Was first diagnosed with ADD(inattentive type) by multiple doctors at 18 years old. Out of the gate they prescribed me 60mg IR amphetamine with dextroamphetamine. I am now 26, taking 80mg/day, and have learned a substantial amount about this drug. No it won't make you any smarter or develop hidden talents, most believe this. The generic (dextroamphetamine-amphetamine IR) is cheaper than its brand (Adderall xr.) Obviously brand is set to higher standards of quality than generics, so yes brand name anything works better than generics, it's common sense. If you use it correctly and find the right manufacturer like Teva, you most likely won't find as many negatives as most people.	8	December 30, 2019	9
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’ve been taking the generic version of Adderall for about 2 years now. I was tired all the time and couldn’t focus. I felt like a slug and when I had energy I still had brain fog, and had a hard time studying. In class, I would fidget in my chair, doodle, and listen to lectures, but nothing would stick in my head. No matter how long I studied.  I was prescribed the 7.5 mg tablet once a day and just the small dose did wonders for my energy levels and let me focus and actually get things done. It helped me talk in social situations and gave me a mood boost.  That being said, The generics changed a couple times. And I’m not sure, but I think I can tell a difference between them. After the pill wears off, my head aches, my legs throb, my body aches, and I’m nauseous and feel sick. I have flu like symptoms, which are miserable. It’s sad because it’s a really small dose and helps me so much but some of the side effects suck. You just gotta see what’s worth it to you.	8	December 24, 2019	61
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	This medication does not work at all now.	1	December 2, 2019	49
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Not very effective; I took a  double dose which cause headaches and made me generally feel ill.  There are  better generics. Company should not be allowed to sell this medication.	1	November 17, 2019	13
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been on Adderal 10 mg for three months now. I have found it helps me so much in the morning. I need to talk to my doctor and see if I can get something for the afternoon. It's been a godsend but I don't have any anger issues just a lot of anxiety. I'm on Xanax as well three times a day and Ambien for sleep which really helps bed by 5 clock I'm wore out. And then my symptoms seem to return. I would recommend this to anyone that has concentration issues. I'm 41 years old and when I went to school they always called you slow. Which always made you look bad. I think my doctor he's wonderful and I'm going to get my Xanax upped and see if I can get something for the afternoon due to that I work many hours a day and I have to be on my toes.	9	November 2, 2019	6
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I got diagnosed with ADHD at the beginning of this school year, being my senior year of high school. Since 8th grade, I've struggled in school, been incredibly impulsive, had very strange eating habits, over-thought everything, and could never contain my anger or anxiety. Once prescribed, my life has changed. My grades went up, and in 3 months I've lost almost 30 pounds (I am still in the normal BMI range). I can control myself. I finally believe in myself because of Adderall.	9	October 29, 2019	80
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Well been on and off Adderall or Ritalin since I was 5. I'm 62 now, and take 60mg XR morning and two 30mg IR in the afternoon. For me it's a Godsend. I can pay attention now,  I'm more sociable, I'm just.......me.	8	October 23, 2019	22
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’m 48 yo woman that was diagnosed with ADHD in elementary.  When I began (on holiday) taking it I’m extremely fatigue/zombie the first 3 days, I am not nearly as engaged with anyone/anything around me (I talk 97% less when I’m on Adderall) and it makes me feel less cognitive.  I feel like it dumbs me down.  After the 3rd day I start to feel better and those “tranquilizer effects” go away. Adderall is an emotional regulator for me. It works wonders for my impulsivity, racing thoughts, fidgeting, feeling overwhelmed, anger, anxiety, zoning out, and my mouth. Yes, my mouth has always been my biggest challenge and has caused me tremendous social/professional problems.  While in a perfect world I’d be on no medication, I have to recommend Adderall for anyone whose suffering from ADHD, because  it has changed my overall quality of life for the best.  Sparkle on beautiful people! 	9	October 23, 2019	81
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I was diagnosed with both bipolar and ADHD. After trying multiple combinations, we finally tried adderall on top of Wellbutrin, Lamictal, and Fluvoxamine for OCD. At first, the adderall did wonders. Completely made me enjoy life again. However, as my tolerance increased, the adderall crash was very intense. It resulted in a bipolar low almost everyday around the same time. I recently just switched to Stratetta and is my second day taking it. Anxious to see how this works.	9	October 22, 2019	29
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’ve been taking meds for ADHD/ADD close to 8 years now.  Tried Adderall at many dosages, types and amount of times per day over a period of many years.  My biggest issue. I forgot to take them.  Tried Vyvanse. It helped but I got nauseous, dizzy every day.  Tried Adderall again and forgot to take them.  One day my doctor mentioned Mydayis. I wouldn’t have to remember taking more than one in the AM.  After a week I could tell that it was helpful but wasn’t able to tell if a BIG difference.  I ran out due to scheduling once & my brain went into hyper drive. I hadn’t felt that chaotic for awhile.  WHILE talking to my doctor she legit wrote out the prescription, handed it to me. ‘go fill it NOW.’ Even had others asking how long I would be without it.  It was clear it helped at that point.  I don’t notice any side effects.  My results with Mydayis are pretty good. No worries of forgetting it, which was the major factor in my switch.	8	October 20, 2019	11
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I'm making this review one year after trying Mydayis for only a week. I switched to this drug from Adderall IR 20's BID to the 37mg capsule, you don't really think your buzzing, but you indeed are, and more so than with Adderall for the same dose. What prompted me to write this review was that I noticed someone else who reviewed this mentioned that they would be returning the bottle to the pharmacy because they didn't want insurance to think they were keeping it. This is an effect of the drug, I too, even though I bought it on the $5 coupon, did not want the pharmacy (who does not care) to think that I wanted to keep this drug so I returned the remaining 23 capsules to them. It works well, puts you in a different state of mind, and doesn't provide the sense well being of some other ADHD products offer, but it does work better than some generics. Perhaps give this a try if you're on generics that don't work. It is pretty strong, but doesn't feel like it. if that makes sense.	7	October 14, 2019	12
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I was on 10MG XR for 3 months and it worked amazingly. This is a very good medication if you have trouble functioning like a normal person, although be prepared for really dark thoughts if you decide to stop taking it. Withdrawal from this drug is no joke, it can make you want to die...but if you keep taking it or taper off slowly you should be fine.		October 12, 2019	22
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I was diagnosed with ADD in 2005 after experiencing horrible distractibility in class while at college and not being able to focus on a single thought in my head.  I was prescribed Adderall IR and I remember feeling like I had drunk 5 Red Bulls or something!  My heart was pounding and I had horrible anxiety the whole day.  I only took it one time.  I decided to get off it immediately.  Soon after, I was prescribed Strattera, which didn't do ANYTHING.  I've gone for about 13 years without actual ADD medications because I really hated the idea of stimulants.  That all changed when I realized my ADD was getting out of control.  I saw my current psychiatrist last week who re-diagnosed me and we discussed my experiences.  I had read reviews from people here who say that Dexedrine works for them if Adderall made them too wired, so I asked if I could try that.  I just tried it today and I had no horrible side effects - no anxiety, no heart palpitations, no edginess, etc.  It is wonderful!	1	October 9, 2019	21
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have suffered my entire life with ADD.  For a while Adderal helped. Then as I turned 49 it seemed to make me more anxious, irritable,  short tempered, and I had No patience for stupidity! Upon trying the Mydayis,  I was immediately impressed. I was finishing projects.  Getting things done right! Able to focus for longer durations of time. Long enough to complete tasks at hand. I feel so much better.	10	October 3, 2019	30
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I will never give this to my child again!, I know all children are different but I'm sticking with Dyanavel XR. While he was on Adderall he was acting angry and violent, like he was on some kind of illegal drug, his facial expressions were intense, and he could not sit still, and was very emotional. so I have to give this a 1 star on my personal experience and my son's	1	October 2, 2019	35
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I've had a prescription for amphetamine with dextroamphetamine for  four years, and Teva used to work fairly well for me. Over the last year or so, it's become awful. I know it isn't me, because I still have old (2-3 years) pills laying around; I tried some of them and they work just fine.   Teva changed something in the manufacturing process. The new pills do almost nothing beneficial (I feel sleepy all day), but they have a ton of side effects. I feel very jittery, my stomach hurts, and I've been experiencing bloating.	1	September 30, 2019	23
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Overall, 20 mg Adderall XR for ADHD helps me to focus. The problem with adderall is it makes me sweat something awful. Anyone else annoyed with sweating while taking adderall?	9	September 28, 2019	62
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Well first off. Adderall is an Amphetamine  which assist with the production of dopamine. Very close  relation to meth. I am 21 years old and I started Adderall again. Previously I was on Adderall from age 8-13 and it worked great. Some say ADHD is not real and it just a symptom of bad health etc... I have been very very healthy and unhealthy which produced no changed in brain fog. Now that engineering is my main task in like I seem to have a hefty amount of brain fog. Adderall does in fact help with focus but the downside is the extreme crashes that happen when you stop taking it.	8	September 26, 2019	20
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been on Adderall for quite sometime. It has helped me focus and also being proactive. I recently got a new script and diff manufacturing teva  I noticed since I have taken it I'm extremely tired. Cannot focus at all I feel like a scatter brain..I had to call my dr to have him rewrite a new script and surrender the Teva (amphetamine with dextroamphetamine) Did anyone get the same reaction?	1	September 26, 2019	20
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I shared my experience recently on here and was going back over and reading others as well.  I believe we should all state the laboratory that producing the specific generic we are each taking. Doing so may help us all narrow down which ones to stay away from and which ones are truly therapeutic.  Eon lab  brand of amphetamine/dextroamphetamine was good until 9 months ago, now they are horrible (no therapeutic value and bad side effects).  I then I switched to Teva and they were decent for about 2 months and now they are giving me side effects.  Plus the pharmacy ran out of them and I had to wait for a new batch and when the new batch came in is when the bad side effect started.  I KNOW the drug manufacturer has changed something.  Hope that helps someone.	2	September 24, 2019	122
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	So, I have had ADHD since I was like young. I never liked the pills they gave me when I was younger because I was already a thin kid and then taking Adderall I would eat even less. So I stopped taking the medication. When I was taking this medication I got most improved student! I went without the drug for years, until just about 2 years ago I started taking it again and It has helped me so much! I am very thankful for this drug. I suffer from fatigue , and many, many other problems. This drug is one of many I NEED, To Think Straight and to not get outta control.  It also helps me BIG TIME with my anger issues. Hope this helps someone! Star Kid Is OUT!	9	September 11, 2019	47
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	This drug is one of the greatest formulas of all time. I went from down and depressed and unmotivated to organized and focused. Also from relatively poor to rich due the effect it had on me with my enthusiasm for work	10	September 11, 2019	57
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I cannot believe that the FDA allows AUROBINDO or TEVA to sale their lousy drugs through pharmacies in the US.  Neither of these generics have any affect on me at all!!  WASTE of money!   They are playing with people's minds and well being!!!!	2	September 6, 2019	110
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Have taken Adderall on and off for around 13 years for ADD and CFS. I was lucky enough to have tried the “real” brand Adderall by Barr laboratories. I’ve never taken over 20mg a day. This medicine has gone to TRASH.The only negative side affect from the Barr version was occasional jaw clinching.   I think Teva must’ve burned the patent formula or something because it has never worked liked the Barr, not even close.  So many negative side effects (migraine headaches, heartburn, nausea)! I keep hoping at some point they might magically start producing a decent version that actually helps instead of hurts.  The original Barr had true therapeutic value.  Eon labs produced a decent generic for a while, but BAM, it suddenly went to garbage at the end of 2018.  So switched back to Teva a couple months back and it started ok( not as good as Eon but better than everything else out there), then last months refill is feeling like they’re changing to something bad too.  Bring back real Adderall!	3	September 4, 2019	78
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I had taken Adderall for many years and was slowly on the decline.  I was deeply depressed and had an absolute hopeless and helpless outlook on life with no relief. I had psychosis, delusions and impulsive behavior which I never had. I began having issues with memory, thinking, reasoning, decision making, tasks, and  concentration.  I would become very agitated if being interrupted. I was very aggressive and agitated constantly, it was at least 98% of the time in 10 years.  I read horror stories about stimulants, namely the Amphetamine line of them. I subsequently tapered off of them and feel 100% better than before. I have no depressive symptoms, delusions, memory problems, agitation or aggressiveness. I was not happy with life and my personal relationships were very toxic. I wasted almost 10 years of my life feeling like this and have other personal complications that resulted from the use of these toxic drugs.	1	August 28, 2019	29
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I'm all shook up. But it works!	9	August 26, 2019	20
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Works well for my adult ADHD. It gets me motivated, and I can feel it kicking in. The perfect dosage for me is the 15mg tablet, morning, and another 15mg after lunchtime! I score the 30mg tablet in half.	9	August 22, 2019	6
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I've had ADHD since I was a kid and after a couple of years taking Ritalin I stopped and then tried it again once in my 20's and again in my 30's but never liked the way it made me feel. Starting in my late 30's I started to suffer from chronic fatigue syndrome which doesn't mix well with ADHD. It puts the body and mind in a bad place. I finally got around to going to the doctor and he recommended that I take Adderall 3 times a day. This has been such a benefit to my life. Not only do I have the energy to get out of bed I can now focus enough to get some daily life stuff done.	10	August 13, 2019	9
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	First prescribed it in grad school for ADD & depression. Worked wonders. Only downside is I became very reliant on it. Was stuck between the two evils of being a depressed zombie (w/o taking it) and feeling like a happy, motivated, focused person (on Adderall). Eventually stopped taking and failed out of grad school. Work was hard, always late, made stupid mistakes, & couldn’t complete tasks. 3 years & 3 jobs later, I broke down and went back to a doctor who rediagnosed me with ADD, Anxiety, & Depression. I was reluctant to start back on Adderall and tried a few alternatives first. Everything made me feel even MORE exhausted; back on Adderall 30mg day; feel normal again. I have the motivation, energy, & focus to complete tasks. Only complaint is anxiety which I resolve w/ a low benzo & exercise. Remember, there’s no reason to be miserable if there’s a pill out there that can change your life.	7	August 10, 2019	103
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	"I've finally found it. - Mydayis it is that little reminder I never had; the missing piece of my conscience that was never there before to tell me ""stop mucking and go do the stuff you should be getting on with"""	7	August 5, 2019	31
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	This medicine initially seemed to work very well for me with improved concentration but after taking it for only 6 months I discontinued it due to anxiety levels being through the roof to the point where I couldn’t function. This was enhanced during social interactions of which is ironic because I know many people say they experience increased desire for social activities. A month after stopping medicine, I started experience psychotic symptoms of which have not subsided. I do not suggest this medicine.	4	August 3, 2019	18
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I'm 19. I've tryed a lot of ADHD medication (I'm from Canada so I have less option than the US). Concerta, Biphentin, Vyvanse. With all these medication I've experienced sides effects, or, in the case of Vyvanse, I was not focused enough. And now I'm on Adderall XR and I can tell you than is the best ADHD medication I've tried. I feel like I can multi-task like Vyvanse but more focus, and this focus make all the difference. I don't feel a lot of sides effects, and they are nothing if I compare with Concerta or Biphentin. and Adderall XR is one of the only ADHD medication with generic availability in Canada!	9	August 2, 2019	23
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Adderall X R 30mg in the morning along with 5mg of Adderall in the early afternoon seem to help my mood and condition dramatically. If you are ADHD I recommend talking with your psychiatrist.	10	August 2, 2019	24
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Started off with  Adderall  5 mg IR twice daily.  Overall, this is a very low dose.  I have found it was more effective and safer to take it every couple of days.  At least for me.  I have tried 40mg and 60mg before so I am very aware of how intense it can be.  If you take it every day you will end up increasing the dosage.  Try to use it sparingly and try doing activities that produce dopamine naturally like exercise or walking and listening to music.  This will help you feel healthier while taking it.  Overall I think it is helpful but definitely feels unnatural and can't believe they give speed to children.  	5	July 30, 2019	35
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I asked my doctor about Mydayis because it lasts 16 hours.    The first week I was so calm, never been so calm in my life, even with antidepressants. I was able to focus during conversations. I organized my desk (a little). Cleaned my car out (a little). My second week i was still focusing but I couldn't eat. I was repulsed by anything other than fruits, vegetables, cereal. But then I felt dizzy...sick to my stomach. My eyes seem to move involuntarily   Nystagmus )mand I got the worst eye strain I've ever had. My neck muscles felt extremely tight and I just kept massaging my neck trying not to panic. I tried to tough it out for the next 2 days but could not. It's been day 2 days since I quit taking it and my eyes are still involuntarily moving a little. I had big hopes for this med but this is how it worked it for me and I was only taking 12.5 mg.  I just needed to let everyone know about this possibility because I couldn't find any info about it. It would probably be considered a tic.	3	July 27, 2019	28
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Diagnosed ADD 18 y/o, on and off Adderall IR since then. Too high a dose causes psychosis...be forewarned. I used to be on 30mg 3x/day, now I'm leary of taking more than 2.5mg 2x/day. Maybe it builds up in the brain, so be sure to take breaks from it often. I notice the side effects outweigh the benefits at higher doses....irritability, zombie-like come-down. My insurance only covers this and Ritalin, so I'm stuck with bad side-effects.	4	July 23, 2019	19
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	"Adderall is literally the only THING Period that I have tried that has improved my life in the slightest (I have ADD/Treatment-Resistant Depression ) - I got my Bachelors degree in Health & Psychology, I tried EVERY supplement herb, nootropic, etc. I'm commenting here is because of all the people saying how it drained them, or over time began making them feel worse - you need to educate yourself - one of the most important being, be SURE to be supplementing with TYROSINE, literally daily (tyrosine converts into Dopamine - like how 5-HTP converts to Serotonin) just like how SSRI's eventually ""poop out"" and just stop working (because they've used up the bodies natural serotonin) Adderall will eventually ""poop out"" on you, stop working, yet even worse when this happens, the more you take the WORSE you feel because its like revving an engine with no gasoline left in it!!! Theres plenty more to look into but even just taking Tyrosine makes a HUGE difference!"	8	July 19, 2019	97
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Adderall is all fun and games until you become addicted and try to stop taking it. I loved and still love Adderall, just like all of the positive reviews here - it works like nothing else, but I will never take it again.  I quit Adderall June of 2018 and it was the worst thing I ever went through - everything you read online about stimulant withdrawal is true x100. It’s almost impossible to successfully wean off of this medication. I went cold turkey 3x before I was finally successful.  It took me months to feel “normal” again.  During this time my life went downhill and I started up again December 2018 at a low dose, which before I knew it increased back to me 40mg dose.  I just quit Adderall again because I will be trying to get pregnant at the end of this year and it was once again a battle but I managed to do it. I will NEVER go back on this medication. Ever. It took me 2 hard lessons to realize how bad this medication is for you and your brain.	1	July 17, 2019	3
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I do not recommend anyone taking Adderall. I was unable to eat or sleep while taking this medication. It caused severe stunting of my growth.	1	July 17, 2019	8
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	"I have always known that I had ADD. However, I was in grad school, and I was studying for up to 10-12 hours a day. I found myself reading and re-reading and was having a hard time retaining information, because I couldn't stay focused. I would study for hours. Long story short, for my master's degree, I had to take practice timed test for NP boards, I failed it. My instructor told me to get tested for ADHD,  and get on medications. I did, and it was the best thing I have ever done, and wish I did it sooner, it cut my studying by half, because I'm very focused. I didn't have to request extra time for my NP boards, and I passed with time to spare. I have no side effects; incr. HR, BP, I eat and exercise, and don't take it late in afternoon to avoid insomnia. I only take it when I study and not everyday.  I believe it's about making the drug work for you and not let the drug control you.  Medication ""holidays"" are great to do."	10	July 13, 2019	36
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	If it wasn’t for Adderall I would be a basket case no questions asked. I'm 55 been on it since 2014 on an everyday basis. I'll take a day off every so often, but it's a rare occasion. My Blood Pressure is 122/74- pulse 64 when moving around normally. Resting my BP is lower along with the pulse rate. If you are relatively healthy heart wise no problems. I know one guy who's pushing 76 years old and he's still taking his prescribed dosage.	10	July 8, 2019	35
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	My son developed tics and we stopped the Adderall medication. Tics remain and one day he hit his head until no hair was there. He also now has blood in his stool no one can explain. Hmmm well permanent  damage isn’t worth the education we are providing now. I would rather buy a franchise than a college degree.	1	July 7, 2019	5
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been taking ADHD Medications for years. I have found that the Generic  Adderall ( Extended Release 20 mg) by Amneal Pharmaceuticals LLC. (CAPSULES STAMPED g454) ARE NOT as effective as other brands	2	July 2, 2019	7
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I've been on and off Adderall IR for the last year. When I'm on Adderall the first 3 months is amazing! I feel highly attentive and motivated. I have to take sleep meds because I'm so wired. The negative is the crash I feel by 6pm. It's like I transform into Angry Smurf - no longer talkative or cheerful and forgot about sex -- my libido shut down. My greatest battle is with food.  I am constantly hungry and when I eat the meds seem to lose its potency therefore causing me to skip meals. I built a tolerance rather quickly on this stuff and it lost its efficacy. IN ANY CASE, DO NOT INCREASE YOUR DOSAGES. Instead take a break from Adderall and try another drug for a couple of months.  This drug is not meant for long term use. Just few month. anything longer is just going to create a monster out of you.	6	July 1, 2019	17
ACT Nabilone (Oral)	Fibromyalgia	Great medicine for my chronic knee pain. Recommend all the way	10	June 3, 2019	9
ACT Nabilone (Oral)	Fibromyalgia	I got my doctor to prescribe this after I tried medical Cannabis because I can't afford Cannabis. In a dosage of 0.5mg twice daily it is perfect. It helps diminish pain and treat my anxiety and gives me the ability to be less serious and laugh sometimes which is nice because my illnesses have left me feeling depressed and awful. In higher dosages I see no benefit. Use the lowest dose possible or bad side effects like dizziness and paranoia can occur at higher doses. For me it is identical to edible Cannabis in effect except it lasts longer. There is no addictive quality that I have noticed. It is helpful for sleep as well. The only complaint I have is there is always a shortage of the drug and it has been on back order for months in Canada. Luckily I have a supply from a little pharmacy that had lots left. Its worth a try and feels like edible cannabis but less psychedelic and more sedating.	9	September 3, 2018	31
ACT Nabilone (Oral)	Fibromyalgia	II have chronic pain, arthritis, osteo arthritis, sciatica nerve pain. I  have been very happy with my nabilone and use it mostly before bedtime for a good painless nights sleep.  I did have a bit of a headache a few times but not all the time or from nabilone.   Have used it for about 8 months and no side effects or complaints.  I have gluacoma and macular degeneration in my eyes, but vision is the same as before use of nabilone.	9	February 18, 2018	22
ACT Nabilone (Oral)	Fibromyalgia	I have tried and am presently using other pain medicine but have been able to reduce the dosages after taking Nabilone for only one week.	8	March 31, 2017	19
ACT Nabilone (Oral)	Nausea/Vomiting, Chemotherapy Induced	I was taking this to see whether it would help me with my migraines,  I still get migraines they are not as severe but my stomach is always upset I don't want to eat I am having too many  days I don't want to eat, not sure what to do now.	6	March 20, 2017	2

ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	Worked ok but horrible GI side effects and weight gain.  Hours after taking it in the morning I had the feeling of a bowling ball in my stomach, sometimes accompanied by cramping.  In the 3 months I took it I gained 20 Lbs which came off when discontinued. I know this is the most popular med for type 2 but the side effects are worse than the symptoms.	5	April 12, 2021	6
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	No issues with metaformin at all no side effects. On 500mg twice daily for t2 diabetes  it is lowering my blood sugar it does work.  It will only give you a boost with weight loss if your diet is clean and are exercising also. It is no miracle drug I'm losing 4lb a week but I exercise hard and eat no junk or sugar. I have 6 stone to lose but certain il get there.	9	April 11, 2021	3
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	I have been on metformin 500mg once a day for 3 mo.  At first it was great I even lost a little weight.  My A1C went up recently and I gained the weight back.  I believe that was due to extreme stress.  My doc increased my dosage to twice a day now.  I have not had many side effects just headaches no stomach issues.  I hope it helps me as I am afraid to go too high on the dosage because of the recall issues.  I am hoping the benefits outweigh the risk.	8	March 6, 2021	9
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	I was taken metformin for 5 months now and am losing a bit of my weight but one thing my concerned is I'm having diarrhoea all time and the worst part is if I'm going out like for walking or groceries middle of this situations I really need to go toilet straight away otherwise I will be poop on my jeans. This is really disturbing for me because some part of my daily life activities is gone. I need to stay home or if I need to go somewhere it should be near in the restroom. I don't  know if some people with diabetes type 2 is having experience same with me...thanks	1	February 17, 2021	30
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	I'm new to metformin 500mg twice daily, just diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, only 1 annoying side effect which is insomnia I can't get a wink sleep. Find it easy to tolerate so far anyway, I find it appetite suppressing as I don't eat as much now, which is a good thing as I'm also dieting and exercising to get my very high blood sugar levels down asap. Hopefully it is as good as people say for weight loss as I need help I'm 130kg now.	8	February 14, 2021	5
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	2 1/2 years ago my fasting glucose was 134. I didn't watch myself and it shot up to 284. My dr. told me, 'YOU HAVE DIABETES!!!' two weeks ago. She gave me metformin 500mg, 2x daily. Previous to taking this med, I was urinating 6-12x each night. I felt so awful, it was impossible to function the next day. During the day, I was urinating 2-3x/hour. My friends thought I was crazy. I was drinking nonstop because of the diabetes, probably trying to flush out all of the excess sugar.   All that has stopped. I get up 1-2 x in the night. I urinate during the day once every 3-4 hours, maybe. the metformin has really helped me, I hate pills with a passion but I must give credit where it's due. I will stay on this drug until I lose weight and bring my sugar under control.	10	February 4, 2021	3
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	Took Metformin for 2 years and lowered A1C and lost weight! Loved it! Then started getting forgetful, brain fog and very poor memory! Decided to go off metformin to see if it was the cause and it all cleared up!!!	5	February 4, 2021	5

ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	Metformin was recently added to my Type 2 Diabetes Meds . I take 2000 mgs a day in divided doses with each meal. It's rough on the Stomach for sure . I'm 62. Seems to keep my sugar levels well controlled and it helps you loose weight.  Get some Zofran from your Doctor to help with the nausea . Will update my experience in a few months. God Bless .	7	October 24, 2020	22
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	Metformin has worked great for me with zero side effects for over 5 years.   I also take 300 mg Invokana each day with about 2000 mg metformin but the Invokana does not seem to actually help that much, but at least I have no side effects from it either.  Have taken Invokana for about one year now.	10	October 12, 2020	6
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	Metformin is not for me. It tears up my stomach big time.  I have asked the doctor for a slow release but it does not work.	1	October 3, 2020	11
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	I was taking Metformin for a lot of years. The doctor slowly increased me until I was taking 3200 MG a day (800mg X 4 a day, 2 in am 2 in pm)which I was told was the Max. Next thing I knew my kidneys shut down and I ended up on Dialysis. The Hospital informed me I was taking way to much Metformin and took me off of it.  I now only Take Glipizide but my sugar is out of control, between 2 & 300 daily reading. I am here trying to find something else I can take.	2	October 2, 2020	31
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	OMG, completely and utterly dreadful. If you have a strong gag reflex you will never get it down. It tastes disgusting..nauseating, do yourself a favor and take regular Metformin (Not extended release) and chop that baby up, add applesauce, and it's a quick, pleasant swallow, just slightly bitter...can't compare to the horrid taste of this stuff. Side effects are another story...	1	October 2, 2020	12
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	Take 2000 mg metformin daily. Has helped my diabetes	9	September 22, 2020	9
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	Before glucophage was a known to help for fertility, I took it for type 2 diabetes and got pregnant 1 & 1/2 weeks after last period. That was 24 years ago. I now take it again because I’m having trouble keeping A1C blood sugar below 7.	10	September 7, 2020	10
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	My doctor put me on Meformin after telling him I am very sensitive to all RX  Long story short I wound up hospitalized for Pancreatitis  ,be weary of these medical doctors they don't listen or care PS his next recommendation was a diabetic drug that has a propensity to cause UTI  I am managing with diet and exercise	1	August 27, 2020	28
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	I took metformin 1000mg in a combo for several years with no problems. 45 days ago a new doctor started me on a new medication plan. I started Rybelsus with Farxiga and  1000mg metformin. I had an immediate reaction of headaches, nausea & extreme hunger and my blood sugar skyrocketed. Doctor had me stop the metformin & the side effects stopped, but my blood sugar remained very high. After a few weeks she had me add metformin back in at 500mg twice a day. My side effects returned and now include constipation, but I'm trying to tough it out. I have been nauseous randomly for several days. I can't enjoy a meal or activities. Doctor keeps telling me I'll get used to it but I'm not seeing it yet. My blood sugar has gone down but not to normal ranges. I sure hope things settle down soon. So far the benefits are not outweighing the side effects.		August 22, 2020	16
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	I was put on metformin ER 500 mg once a day. My doctor told me to raise it to 1000mg (two) in the morning and two in the evening I told her about my stomach issues so decided to do 500mg in morning and 500mg in evening.  The other day I started to have very bad stomach pain woke up at 2 in the morning very bad cramping and stomach pain felt like I wanted to throw up even when I took it had a bad after taste plus made my nose bleed again.  This medicine is not good at all	1	August 22, 2020	15
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	I have been taking Metformin ER for 10 years. It was working fine.  Recently supplier was switched from Teva to Amneal. I found Amneal to cause high blood sugar and I discontinued. Switched to another supplier and BS is normal. I found out today Amneal is recalling Metformin ER 7 lots. I was taking a recalled lot. Recall is for higher level of carcinogenic contamination in these lots. Please  report any adverse effects	3	June 3, 2020	52
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	So far Metformin has been a wonder drug for me. I'm dropping weight, not hungry at all, and my energy levels are up.  I'm taking one with each meal.  I'm losing 5+ lbs a week and it's all from my stomach fat.  I've had one bout of diarrhea but that was in the first 3 days of use and when I took 2 in the AM versus 1 with each meal.  I do think I need to drink more water with this prescription as it seems to slow bowel movements down.  No other issues.  I'm taking a blood pressure medication and B-12 supplements with it. And a multivitamin.	10	May 5, 2020	76
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	I have been taking metformin for a month I've been ok with it so far	10	May 2, 2020	16

ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	Metformin has that fishy smell and taste, which started in 2019, makes me nauseous.  I am going to switch to the Amneal  metformin product.	2	March 15, 2020	4
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	Very disappointed with this metformin product. When I removed the safety seal there was an obvious defect- about a third of the tablets were stuck together and deformed. I don't know if they sealed moisture in the container or not but I don't trust the deformed ones to be safe.	1	February 28, 2020	11
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	I changed from regular metformin as I could not tolerate higher dose and my A1C was up at 9.7 I have now been on glumetza for a few weeks and my readings at home have been much better with no side effects also lost 14lbs in weight I believe my A1C will be well below 7.0 in April	10	February 21, 2020	29
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	I tried regular Metformin and the extended release and my stomach just cannot handle it.  I had severe stomach cramping and uncontrollable diarrhea...meaning when it hit, there was no warning and no time to get to the bathroom.  I tried with meals, with milk, without meals and nothing could allow me to tolerate it.	5	January 31, 2020	66
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	I'm this for T2 diabetes and PCOS. Yay me? -__-  I've been on Metformin since I was about 10 years old. I'm 27 now, it always worked well for me. But I had been off it for a long time due to insurance and income issues. It never caused this explosive diarrhea back in the early 2000s! Thankfully that side effect has subsided.   I learned from some Cysters' (pcos sisters) to take Metformin late at night, in the middle of a full meal and drink a full glass of water. Imodium also helps, but I hardly even have to take that now.   So it lowers my A1C, aided in weight loss, gave me my cycle back and helped with the facial hair some. I take the 1000mg once a day.   Fellow Cysters taking this for PCOS, I recommend you join a PCOS support group. It's blessed me greatly. :)	10	January 24, 2020	24
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	I still have high blood sugar.  Now I get to wake up at 3am and spend an hour dealing with diarrhea. I have been late to work, and missed important meetings dealing with these side effects. I honestly rather back to un treated diabetes than to continue on with meformin.	1	December 28, 2019	37
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	For the past 22 years I have been taking a different metformin brand.  For the past 3 months I switched to glumetza noticing a significant difference. Not only did it help lower my level of glucose, but also contributed to reduce my hypertension to almost normal range	10	December 20, 2019	39
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	"I've lost ten lbs in a little over a month taking metformin for type II diabetes combined with giving up sugary sodas and watching carbs, however passing gas has become a gamble too risky to take if you get my drift. The intestinal ""discomforts"" are real, folks. They're not kidding about that."	6	December 8, 2019	44
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	Has anyone had a problem when they switch brands of metformin?	10	November 21, 2019	19
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	My husband was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes over 10 years ago. Started with  metformin but the numbers were jumping high so the doctor added another one but numbers were still out of range, so another pill, then another was added and talk of insulin the next option. A blood pressure pill was added to protect the kidneys. The past summer my husband joined me on the keto lifestyle as well as intermittent fasting. He  went off all med ( the doctor knew). His glucose readings were great. But the doctor told him that he wanted him to get back on metformin because the latest research showed that it can extend one's life and is good for the heart. My husband did not want to do this but I pushed and he started back on it. Well almost immediately his blood sugar spiked into the low 200's then mid 200's. He went off it and within 48 hours his numbers were down. He is in the 80's to low 100's doing keto & fasting.	1	November 21, 2019	65
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	When I was first diagnosed, my doctor gave me Metformin. After I took the very first pill, I had SEVERE stomach pain, nausea, and vomiting. I spent hours curled up in the fetal position balling my eyes out. I didn't care if it took time to adjust to the side effects. I tried one day's worth of the medicine and tossed the rest. My doctor went on to prescribe Amaryl.  I'm sure Metformin is a great drug for some people, as it works well for other family members, but the stomach pain and vomiting was too much to handle. No thanks.	1	November 17, 2019	27
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	I was prescribed Metformin for prediabetes 4 months ago. Month 1 I experienced awful gastro intestinal issues, to the point of opting to eat only at night, when I was home because 20 minutes after eating, required me to be in the bathroom for an hour. Months 2-4 I took Metformin extended release, (which was not covered by our drug plan), no changes whatsoever other than worsening bloating/stomach pain and liquid diarrhea, then my hair began falling out by the handful. Even my husband was noticing my hair all over the bathroom floor when I brushed. This is an awful medication and all the alternatives seem to have terrible side effects too.	1	November 14, 2019	24
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	I took metformin for two weeks - changing from IR tabs 500 mg twice a day, because my A1C was down to 5.5 - mostly due to gall bladder trouble and not being able to eat. This medication caused SO MUCH INTESTINAL DISTRESS I was forced to switch back to IR tabs. Stomach pain, severe bloating and gas, and diarrhea. This may not be the case for others. I also must take ox bile and other digestive supplements because I no longer have a gall bladder.	1	November 13, 2019	13
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	Been on different brands of metformin for over 10 years.  This one feels like you have just ingested acid.	1	November 7, 2019	10
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	Metformin causes my husband to have yeast infections. Yes, even though he's a man it causes yeast infections		November 6, 2019	15
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	I have been taking metformin 500 twice a day for 4 years with no side effect and with consistent blood sugar level. Eating whole foods, exercise, drinking plenty of water, and drinking light tea will help me avoid some of the side effects.	9	November 3, 2019	26
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	I was prescribed metformin 500mg twice a day. After a week I looked nine months pregnant from bloating. Also experienced flu like symptoms: lower intestinal cramping, low backache, stomach pain, fatigue,  generally feeling bad, low energy. I  quit and went on to try other drugs but could only tolerate Januvia, with moderate success; now insurance won't  cover it and I'm on Basaglar insulin  with the only side effect of  weight retention/almost impossible  to  lose.   I'm so annoyed  that doctors, nurse practicioners and pharmacists pump up all these drugs and how great they are without  telling you  about  side effects, then show no empathy to your when you tell them you're having them. One provider even asked if I  was imagining side  effects!	1	October 18, 2019	29
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	I’ve been taking Metformin 500mg  for a couple of months now I have dry mouth and dry eyes and I feel bloated.☹️	1	October 12, 2019	19
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	I've been taking metformin for diabetes for several years. I had a really hard time being compliant with it, especially when I had to take it twice a day. Thankfully at some point my doctor told me about extended release, so I only have to take it once a day. (4 large 500mg pills)  I don't notice any kind of side effects with it. It is mildly okay at lowering my blood sugar, but it can't get it to the normal range by itself. I also take insulin and Victoza, and the three together are sufficient. Without the Victoza it's also mostly successful, but just insulin or just metformin aren't enough.  I also have PCOS, although it's very mild. I'm not sure if it's mild because of the metformin or because I just don't experience many symptoms.	8	October 10, 2019	6
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	The Metformin ER bearing 184 in one batch I'm taking stinks like rotten fish! Everything I've read says that the immediate release is the one that smells. So did something get messed up?	3	October 7, 2019	3
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	I've been taking Metformin for 2 years now.  So far thank God working well with no problems.  Hope it stays this way.	8	September 9, 2019	23
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	This brand does not stink like some of the others (you know that sewage smell).  It won't make you want to vomit like some of them. Highly recommend.	10	August 23, 2019	16
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	Only side effect I have from metformin is a dry mouth.  Other than that, no side effects.  Lost 25LBS since I started.	7	July 29, 2019	33
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	I was diagnosed with as pre-diabetic I'm on metformin 1000mg twice a day, but the diarrhea is so bad I take the full 2000mg at once at night with food and I am up at least four times in the AM going to the bathroom. So I can't take it early because it keeps me going to the bathroom and I wouldn't be able to work. It's been about a month I get my blood levels checked again in two more months. I hope I am able to keep taking it that long. I wonder if the diarrhea is why people lose weight on this, because during the day while at work I am afraid to eat.	7	July 4, 2019	24
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	Been taking Metformin 750 extended once a day ! Diet exercise  for 6 months by now  My a1c was 13 now is 6 ! With supervision of my Dr and keeping strict life time changes this drop was possible !  Side effects sometimes  creates Gas  ! I feel tired  but I try my best to stick to my exercise program some  back discomfort! Mentally I want to eventually not take the medication anymore but I am not a dr I need to wait for her directions ! People need to check their blood sugars levels daily so they know if treatments are working ! Most important research what you put in your mouth when it comes to your diet it makes all the difference !!!!	8	June 17, 2019	29
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	I was taking Glucopgage for a number of years and the only side effects was diarrhea at least 1 to 2 times daily.  It kept my blood sugar in the low 100’s.

ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	I had a heart attack and once they checked me over completely I was prescribed 1000mg of metformin twice a day. I was also told to exercise - how does one exercise and enjoy life while strapped to a toilet all day long!   The metformin side effects are diarrhea, gas, stomach pains and my Doctor just says those are the side effects there is not much he can do!!!!!!.	2	May 15, 2019	27
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	I was newly diagnosed with DM2 (diabetes melllitus type 2) in  February this year.  Been taking Metformin since then.  I have daily nausea and no appetite. Leaves a bad taste in my mouth.  It has dropped my A1C from 10.9 to 7.1 in first month.  I have also lost 30+ lbs from 265lb.  I am going to try taking the med at evening meal, eating half of meal, take med then finish eating.  I am on 2000 mgs daily.  Overall, it works but the side effects suck.	6	May 13, 2019	26
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	I started with one a day and after 2 weeks my doctor had me take two pills a day with my evening meals to avoid stomach related side effects. I found that if i skip a day the next night I usually have bad cramps after taking metformin. So I will say take with a meal and don't skip doses. I do get occasional stomach cramps, but over all I'm pleased. Since beginning Metformin 9 months ago I've lost 30lbs and I feel great. I would recommend this drug for type 2 diabetes, or pre-diabetic.	9	May 9, 2019	25

ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	"I am on Basaglar,  victoza,  farxiga,  glimepiride.  With all that my A1C was 13.8. Dr. Put me on metformin 500mg twice a day. I started and was nauseous, I told my dr and he said ""that's how you lose weight"" and upped it to 1000mg twice a day. It has lowered my A1C to a 9.4  still high but it is slowly  coming down. Started having gastrointestinal issues along with headache, nausea and vomiting, eye problems. I am on another medication for another problem and the side effects are the same as metformin. So I'm not sure at the moment which if not both are causing my problems."	5	April 28, 2019	14
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	At first all went well with metformin. The 2nd week I was told to take 2 tablets and  that is when the severe stomach pain & nausea began.  After putting up with that for several days, I went to the ER.  I had pre-pancreatitis.  I wouldn't take this or any med with metformin as an ingredient.	3	March 31, 2019	15

ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	Metformin was horrible for me. I was on it for over 6 months and had severe stomach problems/diarrhea the whole time. It never even helped to lower my AIC. I had to finally tell my doctor ENOUGH and moved on to an injection.	1	February 15, 2019	17
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	Gave me very bad stomach issues, caused me to develop a heart problem, and  I stayed in bed the entire year and a half that I was on it. Metformin is a horrible drug that should not be on the market at all. Made me very weak, tired, caused dehydration due to not being able to keep anything at all in my system. After taking it, I developed IBS and other issues aside from CHF.	1	February 8, 2019	22
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	This is the worst medicine I have ever taken. I would rather have high blood sugar than take this medicine. It makes me so sick to my stomach and just always having stomach pain. I am switching over to insulin because at least insulin won’t make my stomach miserable, even if it means taking shots every day.	1	January 14, 2019	15
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	This drug gave me terrible stomach cramps that would start 3 hour after each dose followed by water diarrhea for hours! I searched for answers and suggestions and found one to be my saving grace! Eat half your meal take your pill and then finish your second half of meal. This equals no more stomach cramps and no diarrhea!!!!!	8	December 20, 2018	55

ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	I was prescribed Metformin for type 2 diabetes. Just newly diagnosed with the condition. At this point, I have only been on the medication for a little less than 4 weeks. I have a scheduled appointment at three months for follow-up blood test to check its effectiveness at lowering blood sugar. I am combining this medication with a more plant based, low fat diet coupled with regular exercise. I will update my review when I do have my follow up check and report blood test results.   But, I thought I would go ahead and write a review now to report side effects: The side effects for me are negligible. Almost ZERO. Very, very slight digestive change, absolutely nothing severe as other people have reported to have suffered.	8	October 17, 2018	26
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	Put on metformin 2012 when I weighed 281lbs, and obese. Told had T2 diabetes & prescribed 500mg tablet twice a day. Lowered my A1C. Lost 31 lbs couple years later, dose dropped to (1) 500mg tablet and did very well on this dose for several years keeping my A1C around 6.1 - 6.4 - In May/2018 rushed to ER in AFIB at 245 lbs, 59 years old. Ejection Fraction at 21%  in bad shape. 5 days in critical care unit. Released heart medications & told to lose much weight. Slowly started exercise up to hour per day. Suffered severe side effect lactic acidosis thinking had a heart attack 9/18. Underwent another heart CAT for nothing at 210lbs, having lost 35 lbs since May/2018, I had overdosed on the Metformin 500mg I was taking. My fault not checking BS daily!!!. If you use it, be careful,  check blood sugar daily should you change your diet, exercise, and weight.  Blood Sugar now within normal ranges without metformin.	8	September 23, 2018	35

ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	My Dr. prescribed both Metformin and lisinoprol for my Pre-diabetic condition and lisinoprol for my high blood pressure. I took my first dose yesterday of 1,000 mg in the morning and at night and I can say it didn’t make me feel any different, however today I feel extremely tired and very easily irritated. My mother in law is here making breakfast and asking too many darn questions for me to function right.  Last night I also had a shooting pain in the right leg when getting up to pee (6-7times).  I have not taken my first dose of the day yet and after reading all the horrible reviews about lisinoprol, I don’t think I’ll be taking that....	5	March 28, 2018	10
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	"was diagnosed with type 2 diaberes in 2005. I tried metformin and it made me deathly ill. I practically lived in the bathroom for the month I tried it the first time. After that I checked the internet and found 2 other manufacturers of metformin.  Both caused same reaction.  The Doctor then tried the ""real"" brand Glucophage.  I haven't had any problems since then.  I am able to control my sugar . However I haven't been able to get the ""real"" Glucophage in over 3 months. It is on long term back order and not expected for3or 4 more months.  I will die if necessary before ever going back to the metformin."	10	February 27, 2018	34

My Blood Glucose has been in the 85-150 range the past month. I have modified my diet some. I did experience some diarrhea, though am over it now.	8	December 12, 2017	20
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	This was the first drug they tried for me when I was diagnosed with diabetes. I was unlucky to get one of the rare side effects. It made me super drowsy to where I couldn't get out of bed. When I did get up for maybe eating or bathroom, I felt like a zombie. Working was impossible. I went off the med, felt better, and tried it a second time with the same effect. I gave this a two because I know this drug can work for some people. It works well for my husband with minimal side effects. Just not for me.	2	December 9, 2017	18
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	I started taking metformin 500mg twice daily this June and had hell of symptoms like diarrhoea, stomach ache, dizziness, weakness etc. But the condition improved within a month of use.

ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	Took metformin when I was first diagnosed back in 2011, it worked fine at first. Since 2012 I've noticed increased hair breakage and loss. Finally this year I stopped taking it. Like I said it was great in the beginning but in the end I'm dealing with bald patches and trying to get my hair to grow back.	6	November 27, 2017	16
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	Doctors should take this medicine before prescribing it. Took 2000mg for 2 two weeks with no help with my diabetes numbers.  It made me depressed after 6 days, I have never felt like this ever in my life. I burned all my digestive system, hurt my stomach , my esophagus and colon, felt nauseous. Could only go to restroom once a day, I used to go at least 3 times a day. From day 3 and on, I had a nagging headache, not too painful but annoying. About the third day, my mouth started tasting like sewer, nasty taste.		November 21, 2017	12
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	Terrible medication in my experience. It helped very little with a1c and blood sugar control. I did not have any day to day side effects from this medication however I continuously suffered from high lactic acid levels which created severe pains all over my body which was just too much to take. I have switched to another oral medication and seeing the results that I have been searching for. As far as this medication- never again. I started it for Polycystic ovarian syndrome; later used for type 2 diabetes .	2	November 18, 2017	10
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	I have been taking metforman for several months and it has helped immensely. The only problems I have are with the smell and taste. Both are awful!	8	October 29, 2017	10
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	I began Metformin  2 years ago, dosage of 1000 mg daily at dinner. Initial issues with loose bowels, gas, resolved with in 4-6 weeks. Seemed to help reduce blood sugar, but room for improvement so after 6 months, increased to 1500 mg. Six months later, at check up, I complained of chronic bilateral leg pain. Dr ordered  blood work. No problems there. Prescribed anti inflammatory diet, increased Metformin to 2000 mg. Leg pain got worse, especially in the morning after exercising (weight training, mostly.) Most excruciating morning, after celebration, with an increase in alcohol intake. Really affecting ADL’s.Stumbled upon info about Metformin, alcohol, lactic acidosis, muscle pain. Doctor’s nurse didn’t ask questions when I asked about dosage. I stopped taking. PAIN GONE W/I WEEK.	7	October 16, 2017	16
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	side effects are horrible		September 20, 2017	11
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	My estranged husband was sent to the ER twice 5 days ago, 1st time they sent him home after 3 hrs., then his friend brought him back at 3am the next night, as his friend thought he looked so bad! He got sick on a Sun and got progressively worse over the next few days. Awful nausea couldn't eat was so weak he could not get up. They did all sorts of tests and his ER doc said it wasn't metformin as his blood work didn't show lactic acidosis. But after reading reviews from other people who had similar effects, I am convinced the metformin is to blame.	1	September 19, 2017	18
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	I have side effects from most brands of genetic metformin because they use cheap fillers. Real Glucophage is my only option. Why is it so expensive? My insurance won't cover it. But I have no side effects. Guess it's worth it.	9	September 15, 2017	22
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	I been taking metformin for five years I would have little stomachache but I wasn't bad, it's would control my diabetes but I had to stop taking  metformin because   I started having upper G.I problem & sweating really badly. I been off of metformin for almost two years.	8	September 14, 2017	9
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	I've been taking metformin for years but I'm finding that different generics not only are less affected but give me more acid and G.I. problems. Teva was good but they stop making it.  Sun pharmacuticals/ Cacarowas also good  at contolling BG. WITH NO SIDE EFFECTS but I find the pharmacies are carrying cheaper generics particularly with the Medicare drug plan insurance.  I'm finding that my blood sugar is not as well controlled and I'm having more problems with  nausea and cramping though no diarrhea. I may have to switch  to something else I'll see what the next A1 C is like	6	August 26, 2017	16
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	Excellent control but caused me lactic acidosis	10	August 23, 2017	13
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	I was on Metformin when I was first diagnosed with type 2.  It had no effect on my A1C or my daily levels.  I tried it for 2 years.  I ended up with diarrhea all the time.  They tried switching me to metformin ER(SR) and that didn't help either.  I then was switched glyburide 5mg 2 times a day.  The first dose dropped my blood sugar into the 50's.  I called the Dr she switched it to 2.5mg twice a day.  my A1C is down to 5.6 my daily levels are back to normal.  Just because a drug is effective for one person it may not be for another.  Don't be afraid to ask questions.	1	July 26, 2017	37
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	On the couch all day yesterday with stomach pains, slept like crap and feel like I'm drunk or really tired with a heavy body to day at work.  Im 43, 5,6 and 180lbs....		July 24, 2017	19
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	"Diagnosed as ""pre-diabetic"", A1C 5.9. GP said my triglycerides high and prescribed metformin 500 mg twice a day.  1 pill a day had no obvious side effects. Adding pill #2 gave diarrhea if taken at the same time. So I shifted pill #2 to lunch and it gave diarrhea after 2 days in a row.  So I worked my way up to 2 a day. Mon & Thur for month. Mon/Wed/Fri for a month.  Etc.  My A1C is now 5.3-5.7, with my insurance the generic is super cheap  (less than $1/month), and if I have diarrhea for any reason I skip the 2nd daily pill.  Metformin is working fine for me."	7	June 29, 2017	18
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	I just started  glimpride and metformin 1gm for 2 days ..feeling tight chest, breathing problems,  sudden weakness, dizziness,  cold sweats,.. Should I stop taking this medicine or continue with it??  I take glimpride and metformine 15 minutes before breakfast and metformin once more at dinner (15mins) before..		June 26, 2017	18
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	I was on this medication for about 14yrs. I am multiply disabled, with PCOS & Diabetes type 2, being the reasons why I was on this drug.  Its an excellent drug, one that I was comfortable taking for many years, but recently was having issues with it.  It started making my GERD get really bad.  Also the smell of the pills themselves made me want to puke daily.	7	June 23, 2017	15
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	Today is my day 10, severe diarrhea started on day 2. Bad in the morning and late evening, yesterday I started with the metallic taste in my mouth. I hope it passes. My dose is 500 mg twie a day. As far as side effects go, not too bad.	10	June 23, 2017	14
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	Many subtle side effects that clear over time.  Chance of infection side effect is curious as that is a condition to be religiously avoided with diabetes of any type.  Also since starting Metformin I have red skin on right leg that seems to never go away.  More than a coincidence I think that this appeared right after starting this medication.  I am finding controlling my diet and exercise a much better solution than current drugs but will take for a while longer.	2	June 4, 2017	13
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	I'm actually pre diabetic. I've been on this drug for 3 weeks.  I've lost 9 pounds.  Saw my doctor today because things taste very salty to me.  I'm having wild dreams, sweats/then cold, and absolutely no appetite.  We  talked and I'm going to continue for another 10 days until I'm seen again. Does anyone else on this medication experience any of what I am.	9	May 23, 2017	46
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	Been taking Metformin for type 2 diabetes for more than 10 years.  Over the last five years my memory has gotten so bad that I almost can't function at work, I am dizzy, anxious, cold, and often confused.  My doctor said it was not due to the Metformin.  I lowered my dose myself and the coldness stopped and other symptoms improved slightly.  A year later they were even worse.  I cut my pills in half to reduce my dose again, and most of the symptoms went away.  Now that I have been on this reduced dose a while, the symptoms are slowly coming back.  I won't be taking Metformin any more.  It is a terrible way to live not ring able to remember what someone just said to you, where you left off counting, or how to get to the store.  I am only 44.	6	May 9, 2017	46
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	A few days ago after being diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes, I was prescribed Metformin 500 mg that my doctor wants me to take twice a day. Before taking this medicine ,my fasting blood sugar levels ranged from 140-320. My blood sugar levels were very erratic ,not to mention once my blood sugar got as high as 596, and 375. Plus, it felt like I had a stomach bug that wouldn't go away, because my blood sugar constantly measured at high levels. After been on Metformin for only a few days, my blood sugar levels have started to stabilize, and my fasting range is now between 85-120. I genuinely feel a lot better because my blood sugar for the most part has started to stay in the normal range. Metformin has been nothing short of a miracle drug for me	8	April 7, 2017	42
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	I experienced severe increases in my blood pressure. Had anxiety and panic attaches. Had a small ischemic stroke. Had weakness, numbness and tingling in muscles, muscle cramps, bad taste in mouth. Headaches and confusion.	4	April 1, 2017	34
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	So I been on metformin for about 3 maybe 4 month's (not really for sure so please forgive me) and I was finely having regular menstrual cycles. In January 31, 2017 I spotted and was cramping a lot , I thought it was time for me to start my period, well I haven't had my menstrual cycles since then. I have taking so many pregnancy test and they have all come out negative. At this point I am worried, is there anyone that can help or something before I loss my mind?!?!	5	March 26, 2017	10
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	Been taking 1000mg a day for about a week. No side effects and my blood glucose levels are around 150 now. I'm Full sooner and hoping for some weight loss. Took Trulicity prior and was sick an entire week from one shot!	8	March 20, 2017	22
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	Mildly effective with controlling blood glucose. Side effect of extreme fecal incontinence was unacceptable.	2	March 17, 2017	36
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	Took the first 500mg pill that evening, felt a little light headed at bedtime, same thing that next morning at 7:00am. Took the second pill at 7:30am and by 10:00am I was so dizzy I spent the next day and a half flat on my back in bed, the room was spinning even with my eyes closed.	1	March 17, 2017	26
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	I was started on Metformin ER 500 mg, 1 at bedtime. Increased 1 week later to 500 mg in a.m. & p.m. My A1c was 6.7. Dr would not increase my dose so I did on my own. Having been type 2 diabetic for 18 years I was previously on Actos 10 years & my A1c was always 5.4 or 5.5. I now take the Met ER 500 mg three times daily, 1 every 8 hours & #'s are great. I researched Met ER & learned it loses most of it's punch 8-10 hours after a dose. I've had NO problems at 3x day & my #'s are great!!	8	March 8, 2017	32
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	Metformin has side effects like diarrhea, WHEN I have sugar (regular sugar, fructose and artificial sugar - it does not care). Eat poorly, guaranteed to have diarrhea. Also headaches if sugar spikes quickly, again food choices do this. If I just really want a bite of pizza or candy bar, I eat healthy (lots of vegetables and salad, protein) with NO processed foods, NO breads/pasta/potatoes/rice, and at end of meal have 1-2 bites Savor and stop. I give myself a treat ONCE a month. Keep sugars down to 80-130 by diet and one Metformin 500mg a day. Eat too much at a meal, walk or exercise to burn the carbs. Burn too much and you get shaky or a headache. Water is key too. Water pulls sugar down (dilutes and flushes it out of the fat cells.	10	March 7, 2017	85
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	"I've been taking Glumetza ER (500mg) for three weeks now and so far so good. My levels came down to 85-115 within the first five days from 230. I take it with breakfast but I'm thinking about changing it to dinner time because my numbers always go up while I'm sleeping. I sometimes get a slight headache about five hours after I take it and right about the same time have loose stools. It doesn't bother me as long as it keep my numbers down. I've lost a total of 11 pounds since finding out I'm type 2 and using Glumetza ER. I'm 32, 180lbs, 5'3"" and a mother to two beautiful girls."	10	February 15, 2017	37
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	I've been on 500mg of Metformin for twice a day since Nov 1 for T2 Diabetes. Today is Feb 8 and to date I have lost over twelve pounds without feeling like I've even tried. It not only helps reduce my appetite, but I also feel full sooner. I haven't had any terrible side effects, some mild diarrhea, but that's it.	9	February 8, 2017	43
ACT-traMADol/ACET (Oral)	Pain	I used Ultracet 0.4 mg for my abdominal pain. But it's not very useful to me. I took one Ultracet before the pain worsened but still not provided a good relief to me. I went to the hospital after 4 hours as my pain increased gradually.	3	November 18, 2020	2
ACT-traMADol/ACET (Oral)	Pain	I’ve had an extracted tooth before but this was the first time I’d been given Tramadol/Acetaminophen for pain afterward. I literally called the pharmacist crying my head off asking what else could I take for the pain!   I don’t remember what if been given in the past; (T-3) maybe, but THIS doesn’t work at all like whatever I’d had before! I counted on this medicine to get me through the healing peacefully. It has not.	2	May 16, 2020	6
ACT-traMADol/ACET (Oral)	Pain	I have taken tramadol off an on for years. Everybody is different and everybody has different pain and different tolerances. Tramadol will help minor pain. For me it 50mg did nothing so had to take it 3 times a day I felt some relief not pain medicine for me though! But it is better than nothing everybody has their own pain levels & tramadol can treat those with minor pains & for some people who can’t handle the stronger pain pills.	4	September 29, 2019	8
ACT-traMADol/ACET (Oral)	Pain	Was given this after a tooth extraction. Yeah it works for mild pains (level 4 pain and lower ). It makes me extremely groggy, but I can't seem to really sleep very long while on it. It also dehydrates me really quickly.	5	June 21, 2019	10
ACT-traMADol/ACET (Oral)	Pain	Having shoulder pain for many months went to the doctor the insurance company deny the test that he ordered and they put me on the Tramadol 35.7mg acetaminophen 325mg and it's barely touching it. I'm not sleeping so we're waiting to see what can be done	1	June 6, 2019	6
ACT-traMADol/ACET (Oral)	Pain	Have been given them for hand pain, and a broken foot. It does nothing for at all.	1	November 1, 2018	13
ACT-traMADol/ACET (Oral)	Pain	I have taken it for 2 issues over last 2 years. First was a lower disc, second was a pinched nerve in neck so upper disc. Without it I could not function.   First time was 6 pills a day for 2 months. Second was 3 pills a day for 4 weeks as the pinched nerve needed less. Nothing else allowed me to  move, work, sleep. Without it with the disc issue I could not stand.   I must say coming off was hard. I went slowly down to 1 and stopped but could not sleep for 4 to 6 weeks. Feels like you drank 10 coffees before bed. Pulse in the 90s, I am  norm of 65 pulse. It is worth it for allowing me to function but I wish there was some way to avoid the withdrawral as In fear I will need again someday.  Sleeping pills and other things did not help.	8	September 30, 2018	8
ACT-traMADol/ACET (Oral)	Pain	I have been taking Tramadol for a period of ten years. A starting dosage of 300 mg daily. (100 mg 3 times daily) I have chronic pain in my shoulders, Doctors, Specialist and therapist have both told me, I have severe nerve damage in both shoulders that is not repairable, even though I am having corrective surgery to repair all the tendons, muscles, ligaments and rotator cuff that are torn and partially disconnected. I've never had an upset stomach, or an adverse reaction to the drug, fact is it immediately relieved the pain I was having and allowed me to resume a normal day's work. Addiction/Dependence? Yes I would say I was addicted to this medication. My reason as to Why? Cause it relieves the constant pain I experience 24 hrs a day. Yes I worry about all the side effects, but I AM a responsible adult and follow my doctor's direction.	10	September 11, 2018	14
ACT-traMADol/ACET (Oral)	Pain	"I've been taking Ultracet 37.5mg/325mg for 12 years.  I am 74 years old.  I have arthritis in my joints and degenerative disc disorder in my lower back.  I usually take one pill early am to take the edge off my pain for most of my daily activities.  If I have ""over done it"" throughout the day, I sometime have to take a second pill at bedtime to get pain relief and sleep."	9	July 12, 2018	51
ACT-traMADol/ACET (Oral)	Pain	very good I was taking 37.5mg/325mg x 2 x 4 times a day and it was very effective	9	June 25, 2018	20
ACT-traMADol/ACET (Oral)	Pain	It works very fast	10	April 13, 2018	13
ACT-traMADol/ACET (Oral)	Pain	I have several back and joint issues that have stemmed from degenerative joint and disc.  I take 3-4 pills daily to continue reasonable function.  I have 4 boys at home and pets.  Recently, our health insurance cut me down in coverage to 1 pill a day.  I'm in agony, level 4-5 pain now after 3 weeks of 1-1.5 pills.  Sad situation.  What do we do now? Medical procedure so expensive	8	March 22, 2018	16
ACT-traMADol/ACET (Oral)	Pain	I have arthritis and I am waiting for a hip replacement. The cartilage has gone in my hip. I am walking on bone on bone with terrible pain.  I take 4 - 8 tablets a day depending on the severity of the pain. Ultracet controls the pain perfectly and I can walk almost normally. I have been on the medication for about 4 months now with no side effects. It's brilliant and I would recommend Ultracet for pain relief. It is the only painkiller that works for me.	10	December 5, 2017	28
ACT-traMADol/ACET (Oral)	Pain	I've been using the red capsules for several years with good results.  Recently I was given the beige capsules by amneal and they make me sick and do not reduce my pain.  There were a few white ones mixed in with the others which also worked.  I now have a bottle of beige ones which are worthless unless you want to feel worse.  And, I am unable to get any others because they're controlled and the pharmacy says beige is all they can get from their supplier..	1	November 8, 2017	3
ACT-traMADol/ACET (Oral)	Pain	This medication did not help me with my pain,  peroid. I took up to 400mg at once and still no relief but it did make me feel nauseated and gave me a headache. It's synthetic and really more like a weak antidepressant. I was prescribed it to alternate with my Hydrocodone 10mg tabs. I stopped my Norco for a 2 week period to give Tramadol a chance but it never worked. This stuff is rubish! No it's not equal to Codeine. I have taken Codeine and Tramadol is entirely different in effect. Sorry I'll stick to true Morphine based pain meds like Codeine, Hydrocodone, Oxycodone, etc. Even synthetic Darvocet worked better than this stuff!	1	May 26, 2017	9
ACT-traMADol/ACET (Oral)	Pain	Was given this for the shingles. Works great. Tends to not work as well if taken too much. Dizzy and nauseated when I move but can tolerate.	9	May 24, 2017	5
ACT-traMADol/ACET (Oral)	Pain	I was taking Norco 10-325 for back pain, after 6 years my Dr Changed to tramadol 50mg. Side effects are killing me, Now I do have a lot pain in my liver and my kidneys, nausea black stools and I wonder if I should take a attorney and sue him. 	4	April 14, 2017	12
ACT-traMADol/ACET (Oral)	Pain	Take this when taking a triptan for headache pain, this is to bring baseline pain level down a few notches if I was late taking my regular abortive it usually won't work unless I can get a control on the pain, Ultracet is mildly okay at this, just a trial for headache pain as I've tried many others, but not too bad to have sometimes, can be somewhat effective.	5	April 11, 2017	8
ACT-traMADol/ACET (Oral)	Rheumatoid Arthritis	"I was originally prescribed this medication (it's called zaldiar where I live but is the same as Ultracet) when I got shingles and it helped a lot.  I've since continued to take it since I was also diagnosed with RA as it works incredibly well for me. It means the difference between controlling my pain sufficiently I can keep working, and being almost unable to function. It helps with both the pain and fatigue I feel -- when I first started to take it the effect was so profound I felt as though I was back to ""normal me"". I'm now taking 2 tablets twice a day and that's sufficient to keep everything under control most days. If I need to I can take them 3-4 times a day but that's rare for me unless I'm having a major RA flare."	9	November 12, 2017	12
Acalabrutinib	Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia	Have had CLL for 10 years.  Joined early MDAnderson ACP196 trial for previously untreated 6  years ago, after having great build up of fluid around lungs.  All problems went away within a couple of months after starting treatment.  Life is normal with no side effects.  Have traveled the world since.  Still a trial participant.	10	November 7, 2020	6
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	Day 1 again, I was on Campral before but relapsed due to family issues, etc. Please God I hope it helps me again. Good Luck everyone.	8	April 27, 2021	0
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	Honestly, I am infuriated that no doctors or psychiatrists ever during my 10 year long battle with alcoholism ever even MENTIONED the existence of this medication to me. I had to ask for it myself, and I was turned down the first time. This medication needs to be talked about more!! This is a MIRACLE DRUG!	10	April 26, 2021	1
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	I am 11 days sober now after doing a 10 day community detox on librium capsules and started taking acamprosate 3 days into it.  I am 38 now and been a heavy beer drinker since I was young, drinking more and more over the years until I became dependent. Before detox the morning dry sickness and all the horrible stuff that came with it made me very ill.  I drank beers before work and during, only when the shakes kicked in or that horrible sick feeling came along!! I managed to hold down the job don't ask me how as I must of stunk of booze. I have now quit that job to take time out to get well good news going into new job soon !!  I've now finished the detox and continuing taking acamprosate 2 tabs three times a day, I find these helping me along the way - the cravings are not as bad but still come and go definitely would be worse without these tabs.  I will keep taking to keep free of the  drink wish me luck !!!	8	March 25, 2021	9
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	I have been drinking every day for about  thirty years most days I was drunk. I have worked most of my life I was a functional alcoholic. I was tired of my continuous behaviour and  could not see a way out so I got some counselling and was prescribe acamprosate now 116 days sober know cravings and very little desire to drink	10	March 23, 2021	7
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	I've just started taking campral day one. I'm worried about the side effects??		March 20, 2021	5
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	This helped me a lot with alcohol withdrawals. Usually I will get shakes and horrible anxiety. This reduced it by half.	10	March 7, 2021	3
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	I am 67 years old and been a steady drinker since I was about 17 years old.  With the years my alcohol consumption  steadily grew more and more.  I often had plans to quit/reduce my drinking but it never lasted longer than a few days☹️ With  Covid last year changes happened and one of them was that my husband was now going to start working from home.  For us this was not the best as now we ended up drinking every day and we were consuming more as the months went on.  I reached a point where I had put on a lot of weight and I was not managing my anxiety.  I had heard of Campral from a friend of mine and went to see my GP.  Don’t think I will ever drink again as I just don’t miss it	10	March 7, 2021	9
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	I am in my second week. The medication seems to be working well for me. I have had 3 drinks since I started taking this medication. I just kinda wanted to see if I would have the same urges I used to have to keep drinking until I couldn’t anymore. Well I didn’t. I just don’t have the same desires I had in the past. I was an extremely heavy drinker normally a minimum of 30 beers per day. At 40 years old I’ve let alcohol ruin my life. Jail countless times, loss of friends and family respect. 3 years in Prison, lost jobs, you name it I’ve been there and done it. I’m very happy with this medication and have no desire to drink ever again. All I can say is I wish I knew about this medication 20 years ago. This is the only thing I feel like has ever worked for me. I’m happy now and doing the things I couldn’t do before because of my horrible physical addiction to alcohol. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to quit.	10	March 3, 2021	5
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	I was struggling trying to stay sober for a year. I would put a little time together but was struggling with daily cravings, eventually I would give in. Was active in AA following all suggestions, yet couldn’t get rid of the mental obsession to drink. I was desperate for something else to help, so I did research and the reviews here made me willing to ask my doctor and give it a try! I was feeling hopeless and this working gave me a little hope! That was 107 days ago and I haven’t had a drink since! When thoughts of a drink came to mind I was able to stop them from snowballing into an obsession to drink. I give campral the credit In allowing me to think sanely so I could really work the AA program. So grateful!! No side affects just lack of alcohol cravings! If you’re struggling like I was, talk to your doctor!!! It has helped me tremendously!	10	February 23, 2021	4
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	It worked for me for 7 weeks. I still had intense cravings but not everyday. I am in a very stressful living environment and I started drinking again. It has been 3 days having glasses of wine right before bed. I haven't stopped taking the medication. I read somewhere not to. I still believe it was the best thing but I need to he in a better environment and seek out a support group. Even though I'm very disappointed in myself, I still believe I can do this. Fingers crossed	7	February 21, 2021	2
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	I've been drinking heavily since about 2001 been rehab at least 6 times  detox more than I remember. I've been on campral for a week on the full dose, it hasn't made a difference I'm drinking now, the doctor tells me to persist it will build up in my system but I think antabuse probably better.	3	February 16, 2021	0
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	"This medicine is saving my life. Literally, it is the best thing in the entire world for me.  On 4th of July I had ""one drink"". That turned into... you can guess the story... I found a psychiatrist and told him I'm an alcoholic, help me! We tried naltrexone first but I had an allergic reaction in my lungs (I have a rare lung disease.) Next we tried this and I built up to 6 pills a day. As the weeks went by, I found it REALLY does work. I have only had a strong craving twice, and it was fleeting.  Both times, I had forgotten my mid day dose. It seems to make me happier,  too. More motivated and enthused about life, and less grouchy from craving drinks. You must have willpower to keep taking it.  If you don't, I'm pretty sure you're able to get drunk. Do yourself the biggest favor. Take this, religiously. We all know, one drink is too many, and a thousand is never enough."	10	February 10, 2021	2
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	I had been drinking heavily for many years and I am 38 , decided ring up GP for medicine help for my alcohol craving, he offers me acamprosate and told me I did need to have some will power if I didn't have any will power then the medicine may not work as well. The first 6 day I take the medicine I have a lot alcohol craving even dream about alcohol but the craving don’t last so long like 5 minutes and come back like 20 minutes keep craving on and off it make me wonder does this medicine even worked. Then I go online reading the reviews of the medicine it says that it takes some time to work.  Now I am on my week 3 sober and I won’t say it easy and craving still come back but I say without the medicine I can’t even write this review because I will be drunk or black out. I am hopeful stay sober for good with acamprosate.	10	February 4, 2021	2
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	I just turned 48 and have been drinking for over 35 years. Over the past 30 years, I have drunk every day probably only going without a nightly drink 10 times per year. I tried Naltrexone twice, the first time it worked the second time my body didn’t recognise it. 30 days ago I started taking Campral, 2 tabs 3 times a day. I have now stopped drinking. Amazing drug.	10	January 31, 2021	15
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	I become increasingly alcohol dependent over the last 10 years. I realised I had a problem when I started thinking about alcohol in the mornings and started planning my day around alcohol. I was drinking an average of 10 standard drinks a night and struggled having a rest day, so made myself seek help.  I’ve been on campral 6 tablets daily for approx 6 months now. It wasn’t a miracle drug for me at first at all - it reduced my cravings and takes the edge off weaning off alcohol - but it seems to quietly strengthen your will power and ability to dramatically cut down.  I only feel that now - 6 months later - I’m at a really good place. I currently drink probably 2-3 times per week and rarely drink more than 4 standard drinks.  Cravings are now few and far between. I can drive past bottle shops, I don’t wear myself out fighting the thoughts of buying alcohol and drinking it, and I’m savings between $100-200 per week.	7	January 26, 2021	3
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	I tried Naltrexone and that didn't work for my alcohol problem. So my doctor prescribed Campral for cravings. And although it did eliminate cravings for alcohol, the side effects were horrific. Dizziness, nausea, splitting headache and severe cramping. I stopped taking after 2 days! To top it off, the script cost $126 and of course, I can't return for refund.	10	January 24, 2021	0
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	I would drink a bottle of red wine at least a night and have done for many years. Trying to stop drinking in the past worked for a few days and then I'd feel great for having a break and then get straight back on the wine. Acamprosate is amazing. I haven't drank now for 2 weeks and most importantly, I have no desire to. I now sleep very well and deeply and have a buzz each day at work. There is no desire to drink when I get home. Something has reset in my brain and furthermore there are no side effects. It seems to me that my former thought-process of wanting to have a drink has been erased, or at least has been rendered unimportant to my sub-conscious being. Acamprosate works for me. I'm very pleased.	10	January 7, 2021	17
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	I've been a alcoholic for years 64 years old now in an out of rehabs detox 4 times in the last year, hospital 2 times jail 1 all in a year.  My doc noticed my blood tests showed liver problems ended up several test later was contacted by liver doc who told me I had the beginning of liver failure and advised that I start Campral been 54 days sober not looking back feel better and hope my liver heals. You can do it if I can	10	November 17, 2020	54
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	Parent, full-time teacher, part-time PhD student and was drinking a bottle a night for about two years. I hate myself for letting booze get the better of me. Taking the med acamprosate for 4 days now and haven't touched alcohol since. However, I feel so tired, irritable, unmotivated and have no appetite. I hope these side-effects go away soon. I felt happier when I was drinking, but I know it was no good for me or my family. Just hope I don't end up a zombie, going through the motions every day without any joy aside from having better health.	7	November 4, 2020	6
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	I was a heavy drinker since I was 16. I am now 42 and have been an alcoholic for the past 10 years. After a week of binge drinking I ended up in hospital. This was 5 months ago. After detoxification I was prescribed Campral. 2 tabs, 3 x day.  I haven’t had a drink since. I can now go to the pub with friends and am happy to drink soda water.   I never thought I’d make it to this stage	10	August 16, 2020	89
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	I'm a 48 year old male who's been an alcoholic almost all my life. Coming from the UK with its drinking culture I always thought it was normal to go the pub everyday. I guess I was drinking 10 pints everyday when I was 18 years old, more on weekends. I was a 'functioning alcoholic for about 10 years.  My drinking gradually got worst and by my 30's I was drinking neat vodka. I started to drink in the mornings before work. I started to lose jobs, got arrested for being drunk too many times to remember, lost my driving licence 3 times in 15 years, the last time I was sent to prison. No matter how hard  I tried, I couldn't stop. I tried AA, rehab. Eventually 13 months ago I did another detox, only this time I was given Acamprosate after my detox. I haven't had 1 craving for alcohol in 13 months. I stopped taking it 2 months ago and I still don't have any cravings. This is a miracle. Please give it a try if you are suffering with alcoholism.	10	May 20, 2020	54
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	Campral truly is a miracle drug for me. I had 20 years sober. 12 step meetings kept me clean. However, I went through serious health issues, a bad divorce and subsequent abusive relationship. I drank in 2018, but within a month of drinking I ended up in the ER, which motivated me to stay sober for 2 months. Drank again almost against my will! I was prescribed Antabuse and Campral...stayed sober another few months. I stopped taking the Campral, mostly because my crappy Medicare didn't cover my monthly script, which was $100. I wasn't going to meetings either. I know the Campral worked. I could walk by a liquor store and have no interest going in. I quit again because of my health and family. Only problem is it took a week to work. I'd take Antabuse but, like with the Campral, Medicare expects me to pay $90/month. I am committed to taking the Campral. It's been 5 days no drink. I don't have the desire. Only side effect I had was occasional diarrhea.	10	January 25, 2020	62
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	Campral has been a “miracle” drug for me and my alcohol. I’ve been an on & off drinker my entire life and realized it was hurting me. Burying a few friends sharpened my focus. Now, just over 2 months into zero booze... I feel much better. Campral helped me through the danger zone: 5 to 8:00 PM eating dinner & watching TV. The craving and temptation seem to have disappeared- my only side effect is flatulence- easy to deal with. I also practice HALT (hungry, angry, lonely, tired) to warn me against a relapse. Campral works. Two 333 tabs three times daily.	10	January 18, 2020	79
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	I’m a mid 60 year old degrees engineer with a very good life.  I have a good job and boss and even greater wife and family. I’ve been drinking since a freshman in undergraduate- this increased when I went in the military and has since been sort of up and down over the years.   Since hitting 60 I noticed I was drinking more- a definite tolerance was developed. I have quit cold turkey at least three times- and each withdrawal was worse- the last was very bad so I reached out to my physician, was completely honest & since it had been four days since my last glass of wine- he recommended Campral, two tablets, three times daily - I’ve been careful to stay on the precise dosage schedule.  For me, this medicine is WORKING (all caps on purpose). The cravings, though this is a subjective rating, have diminished considerably. I’m not rushing to get home to have a drink now, and I feel more alert or “brighter.	10	January 4, 2020	69
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	I had a medical detox in August 19 and have been on Acamprosate since then, 6 tablets of 333mg a day. I was drinking up to a litre of vodka a day and was unable to go a day or two without. Mainly drinking in the mornings at work as the jobs were not difficult, although obviously making mistakes when I topped up too much in my breaks. So far no real urges to drink as I really don't want to go back to where I was and what I lost from it, especially in the last 6 years- sackings from work / break-up from a partner of 15 years / & not being there for my son. My worry / question is what happens when I stop taking it? My clinic said to take for 8-12 months, will it stop working and the urges come back? The cost to me is £10 a month in the UK.	10	January 3, 2020	23
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	acamprosate is exceptional for alcohol issues in it's effectiveness & lack of side effects. I'm only 3 months in but my goal was Xmas day yet here we are past that date & I'm looking forward to reaching the 1 year mark. Yes it does take some willpower but hardly any in comparison to cold turkey.  Gives you the strength to not want to have to face day one ever again.  It's easy, you eat these pills 3 times a day and no longer are you a slave to the poison. First 8 days are tough because you feel as with every time you sober up you're missing out. Next 8 days you note small mental changes. 1 month = no more explaining to friends as they all now know. Second month takes time but with a few challenges passed with ease you start to feel exceptional.  Month 3, well it's been great as everyone around me still gets sloshed & I'm happy for them with no regrets or feelings of being a wowser.  Stoked to be free of the dependency it commanded.  I want this drug to be advertised to the world, it's the ultimate	10	December 27, 2019	29
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	I have been on Campral for 7 days for alcohol issues. The first 6 were very difficult as I was still craving to drink. I had one nip on day 6. It made me feel nothing and I didn't want another. Then finally the next day on day 7. No cravings! I've been a on/off drinker and binge/blackout drinker for the last 39 years. I am 54 yrs old. I've tried Campral several times  in the past but couldn't last more than a few days on it. So finally I've made it to day 7 with only 1 nip and I feel a huge difference. I also feel calmer as I normally have a lot of anxiety. I'm sure as the days go on it will only get better from here as long as I keep taking it.	8	November 4, 2019	75
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	I was told Campral would take 5-8 days to start working for my alcohol issues. It took all 8 days to notice the reduction in cravings & it was very tough that first week to white-knuckle through the drinking urges. Previously I had started Campral but not made it a full week many times before, making a waste of the expensive attempts that only lasted 3, 4 or 5 days on previous tries.  But this time I made it to 8 days, and I definitely notice that the urge to drink has decreased and is finally manageable. I don’t quite have cravings at this point, more like longings, almost of nostalgia for the escape. But alcohol was killing me and I am finally at a place where I can manage the desire and not give in to it. I credit Campral for that.  The downsides have been the high cost (my insurance covers it partially) and the length of time til it worked for me. But previously I tried Antabuse and Naltrexone and those ultimately failed. Campral seems like it could work. Good luck to everyone who needs this medication.	8	October 19, 2019	69
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	LIFE SAVING.  For the last 10 years I drank 4-6 drinks in the evenings on weekdays, and 6-8 on weekends.  And the cravings were starting to happen in the morning - at work etc.  I knew I had to stop drinking.  But stopping was always horrible.  I would always get triggered or stressed and go back to the Gin.  Within a day of taking this medication I have lost 90% of my desire to drink.    Why this isn't a FAMOUS drug for alcoholics is a mystery to me.  In my opinion our culture is addicted to BLAMING alcoholics.  This drug is great and works for alcoholics. Good ol' puritanical guilt tripping at its finest.	10	October 11, 2019	27
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	I was an almost daily drinker for 10 years (binge and social drinker before). I knew I was slowly dying, felt like garbage all the time, and had a constant internal battle of drinking, not drinking or recovering from drinking. I have been on Campral for 10 months now and haven't had or craved a drink. That was impossible to imagine before. I take 666 mgs daily (started at 333 mgs) and haven't had any side effects aside from mild gastro stuff at the beginning. I use it with therapy and support as recommended. For me, it's been a wonder drug.	10	October 8, 2019	21
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	Been taking for 1 week  and my cravings and desire for alcohol have dramatically decreased to a manageable level.  Bonus my blood glucose have averaged below 100 and stayed within 70-120 for 97% in target since my last drink.	10	October 7, 2019	12
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	I have been a very heavy drinker for 20yrs,  a bottle of vodka a day, I would get withdrawal seizures and tried detox and rehab several times. The first couple of times I was put on campral, I could feel the effects of the cravings going away but mind over matter made me pick up the drink. Now, I guess it's different for some people, I can so much easier refuse a drink as I'm happier to sit with my emotions than go there, and if I was not on campral I don't believe it would be possible and definitely nowhere near as easy for me. I thoroughly recommend it if you are willing to try anything to get your life back or some form of normality, and not use of alcohol for a crutch, campral will help immensely. Best of luck to is all	10	October 5, 2019	72
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	This medication did absolutely nothing at all to stop me craving alcohol. I am so disappointed as I expected it to work.	1	September 11, 2019	20
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	I am 5 days into my first week of Campral 333 mg 3x a day. I am careful to stay on a schedule of 6 am, 2 pm,  and 10 pm. So far all seems well. Idk if this was a placebo effect but I was NOT craving a drink from the first night.  My drinking has escalated over the past 8-10 years from just a couple drinks on weekends to nightly drinks that led to hangovers 2 or 3 times a week and blackouts a couple of times a month.  Breaking free from alcohol is something I truly desire and this seems to be giving me the help that I've needed. I have noticed that my dreams have been very lucid and disturbing; hoping this goes away. Either way, I'm sticking with it.	10	August 25, 2019	87
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	Just got my  first prescription of Acamprosate. I'm reading these post. I've noticed some people say it didn't work for them but none of them say what dosage or if they were taking it as prescribed. So those post do not look honest. Please input your daily dosage, how many times a day and for how long.   For my self I will follow the prescription and check back with. God bless and wish me luck.		August 15, 2019	52
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	I’ve suffered every type of consequence from drinking including pancreatitis, cardiac arrest, and a stroke but each time something health wise or another negative situation happened, it was never enough to make me quit drinking. I just got out of rehab again, but this time I heard about Campral, and figured I had nothing to lose so I agreed to try it. Although it’s only been a month I don’t crave alcohol at all. I think I might make it this time.	9	August 13, 2019	127
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	Miracle.  Been taking Campral about 4 days and I’m already seeing great benefits.  The last few years I’ve been a heavy drinker due to a lot of trauma in my life.  I’m 42 now.  I was always able to quit but it never lasted no matter AA meetings I went to, shrinks, etc, I think mostly because not drinking made me anxious, racing thoughts, worry, irritable, tired, depressed, angry, lonely, etc.  I stumbled onto this med after finally going back to my GP.  I had no idea it even existed and I researched the internet for years looking for something to ease my symptoms.  I’ve been alcohol free a couple of weeks now but feel COMPLETELY different.  No more bad symptoms!  It’s gotta be this medication.  It makes you wonder if the booze companies lobby to suppress this drug’s existence.  That’s how helpful it’s been for me.  I’ve taken antidepressants, anti anxiety, etc and this now is all I need!  I hope Campral works for anyone else needing and begging for help  for their alcohol dependence or being a alcoholic  like I was, it really is the drug that works for alcoholism. 	10	August 11, 2019	131
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	I went to 4 rehabs of the ‘best’ rehabs in the nation- betty ford, hazledon, father Martin Ashley . Relapsed every time I got home. I felt extremely low and depressed. WTH couldn’t I stay sober! I was headed back for a wonderful 5th visit and decided give campral a go since I had some campral lying around. I was astounded. The desire to drink simply disappeared. That angry itch that once demanded to be scratched was non existent. I didn’t go to the rehab and just stayed sober. I attend meetings just to be around other people who struggle, but in the past meetings didn’t stop the endless longing to drink. For meetings make the desire worse since all they talk about is drinking! This medication liberated me from the constant obsession of booze. As someone who has spent over 100k trying to sober up I urge you to give this medication a shot if you are struggling. It is not a placebo in any sense. Thanks for letting me share.	10	July 31, 2019	30
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	After many years in and out of ana and relapsing and huge consequences due to my drinking. I can now say I literally do not feel like having a drink. Even the thought is just passing. I’ve noticed also I’m losing weight. And not wanting to smoke as much. I feel more upbeat. I do listen to AA  meetings in the evening.  It disheartens me to so many people struggling and this is like a miracle cure to get a big chunk of sobriety in the beginning of being sober. It wouldn’t surprise me if the alcohol companies have invested in keeping this quiet. A very good modern drug. I recommend it to anyone who is struggling in early recovery	9	July 19, 2019	82
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	Awesome!   Campral is working great after 2 weeks no desire to drink!	10	July 17, 2019	49
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	I am a 36 yr old mother of 3, lots of history of abuse (sexual,emotional,mental) perpetrated by family members, father and ex husband, have a history of depression and anxiety. Have been drinking alcohol to excess for 16 yrs.  I could go without alcohol,(a 6-10 pack of rum and cola cans) if pressed but would always feel ‘joyless,’ hard done by, anxiety ridden, depressed.. Being a smoker as well, my health was starting to deteriorate quickly..  Attempts, including going to AA, Valium to help with the ‘witching hour,’ self control, never worked.  I thought I was going to die from the drink, I was beginning to want to, the awful life that I have endured, in my head for so long was becoming unbearable.  I started Campral 7 days ago, I haven’t wanted an alcoholic drink (or cigarette!!) since the night before taking my first dose! This is my miracle!!!!!  I honestly cannot believe it, it’s like I have never been addicted to anything, like I’ve been released from insanity..  CRAZY!!	10	June 20, 2019	132
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	Four days in and my husband has shown no signs of giving up drinking. He’s been on naltrexone and now this, I’ve given up hope that anything will ever work and it’s ruining my life. I wish we could share a success story like most of the others here	2	June 11, 2019	9
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	Thank you for sharing your theme, I have started Campral today, I feel teary and not looking forward to my first act at stopping, which I will try hard from now on.  		June 8, 2019	36
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	I sought  specialist assistance eventually for my alcohol dependence . I took librium and then campral and generally with support did 3 years sober until my mums wake in May 2017. It creeps up on you and before you know your dependant again. I've got a supported detox arranged for  me after my 50th and intend to take campral again after librium detox. I strongly recommend you take time off work and be proactive in seeking support. Take a good look at your habits and strategize. I was at my happiest sober. Didn't even think about it after a while.  I realised I wasn't boring and I hadn't lost my sense if fun. In fact I had more energy to have fun and lost loads of weight, so I am really looking forward to that one. It's nothing to be ashamed of it's a courageous move often admired. I'm really looking forward to my break of what prevents me from doing things I want to do. If you fall of the wagon then suss out why. Get support and pull socks up again. Ignore the stigma! Good luck to me and you. We rock for trying to break cycle 	8	April 30, 2019	110
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	Exactly the same experience as Sober Dave, word for word. One week in taking acamprosate and NO DRINKING, I have now realized why I have been drinking and I am positive about working on making my life better, where as it felt impossible before.	10	April 25, 2019	9
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	After a decade of heavy Vodka drinking,  I levelled with my doctor who, at my request put me on Campral.    I lowered my alcohol in take for 8  days to 3 oz a day then began the Campral.  I'm in disbelief how on the first day I felt euphoric!  I had a therapy session which is important for me now.  This works, why don't people talk about this more.  Some said it took a few days I am grateful.  Day 2  feel alive and Brave.		April 23, 2019	58
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	Hi,   I just wanted to share my experience regarding taking Campral for my drinking. At first, I was skeptical that it would work. My wife has been telling me about this medication for a while now.  I have been a heavy drinker; my weekly consumption would be a 3-4 700ml bottle of Vodka. Some nights I would black out and not remember a thing.  Since taking Campral for 1 month now, I do have some cravings but not enough to start back up again. I highly recommend this medication to anyone who wants to give up or cut down drinking.   Talk to your doctors as they can recommend what steps need to be taken.	10	April 22, 2019	49
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	I’ve been drinking heavily for 15 years, I’m 34. Fought in 2 wars, multiple times. I only feel normal when I drink. I’ve been taking this drug for over a week. The second day I relapsed but picked my self up.... literally and continued taking it but at the same time digging deep, not to drink. Today a blizzard blew into Denver and everything was closed down so I was bored and had cravings. I went and bought a fifth of vodka my usual nightly consumption. I got home poured a big glass. It sat there for hours I had no desire to drink it. Unfortunately I’m cheap so I am currently drinking it because otherwise it’d be a waste. That being said I’m surprised that I actually felt that way. I feel hope. I will pick myself up tomorrow and keep on keepin on.		April 11, 2019	11
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	I've been taking Acamprosate for about 18 days now and it has definitely decreased my cravings. With that said, it also makes me very drowsy to the point of where waking up is very difficult. It also has made me weak and sluggish. I have been more clumsy probably because of those things. Mild headaches also make an appearance from time to time, but they mostly last a short while. Even with all of these side effects I think it is a well worth medication to try for who ever is ready to be done with drinking. (alcoholic of 25 years)	7	March 12, 2019	10
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	I’ve been on Acamprosate for three weeks and still crave alcohol as much as ever. All I want to do is sleep and I feel tired all of the time. After about a week my mood changed and all I want to do is rant and rave about everything and to everyone. I will probably quit taking the pills and see if my mood goes back to normal. It is causing havoc with my family. I have chosen not to get counselling, but might have to if I don’t start feeling better. This experience is worse than being an alcoholic. I think it either works well or not at all, and unfortunately, it is not working for me.	1	March 8, 2019	6
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	I have been drinking heavily for 2yrs, I'm 39years old, its killing me, I have had a past DUI, broke leg after falling while drunk, only day 2 for me, I hope it works, I need to stop or alcohol will be demise. I would drink until I blacked out. I pray that it works.	5	March 2, 2019	42
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	Greenpea...don't lose hope at all.  I have done a ton of research and it takes up to three weeks to begin to change your brain chemical  imbalance and restore the neurotransmitters...keep taking it!! You can do it!		January 29, 2019	54
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	I have been taking six 333mg Campral daily and have so far been sober for 270 days.  For the first few weeks I was sceptical but trust me after a month you won't look back.  Not only is it so easy to refuse a drink, I just don't feel like one.  Since 9 months ago when I had my last drink I've lost 20kg just from the lack of extra bad carbs and sugars.  I feel amazing and I thank the campral for turning my life around.   I drunk about 10-15 units daily for years.  Not a massive drinker but a regular one (like most Aussies). I needed to give up but failed every time.  Campral has made it so easy and I don't even think about drinking.  If you're reading this and doing research I 100% recommend you see a doc and see about going on campral.   You won't look back. Only $38 a month in Australia too...	10	January 26, 2019	97
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	This is my third day and I am impressed. I have been a heavy drinker (1-2 bottles of wine per day) for the last 20 years. Before Campral I was constantly having withdrawal symptoms of severe anxiety, depression, guilt of not doing anything right and not recalling anything at all- my memory was shot!  It’s only day 3 but I feel good: less anxious, not shaky. I do sweat lots at night but that is it. So far, it is great. I hope I can get my memory back and stay sober. Good luck to all.	9	January 22, 2019	90
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	Been taking this since Friday. Maybe it’s not enough time? But right now I’m drinking a glass of red and enjoying it. I went to my local store and just couldn’t help myself :-(.  I really really wanted this pill to work. I’m heart broken.		January 21, 2019	21
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	I have been a heavy drinker for 20 years.  I just started on campral 1 week ago, this medicine is working for me, no cravings  for alcohol whatsoever so far...early days yet, but so far so good.	10	January 13, 2019	10
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	This drug has really helped me stay sober, I didn't have a sudden miracle moment but realised that I am not constantly craving alcohol and I can now cope with grocery shopping and meals out with company without wanting to drink. I am also having Therapy. I am a 48 year old female	9	December 21, 2018	13
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	I see from other reviews this medicine seems to work 100% or not at all. I'm in the lucky category, along with my husband who is taking it too. We are 37 and 40 years old and have been highly functioning heavy drinkers for the last ~ 10 years. We regularly have 3 - 6 drinks a day on weekdays and maybe 5 to 8 drinks on weekend days. We started taking Campral just a few days ago, and I feel like a different person already. Miraculously, it takes the desire to drink away completely. I can hardly explain it.  I went to a restaurant today where people were enjoying martinis and wine all around me, and I wasn't the least bit tempted. Nighttime has historically been difficult when trying to quit, and we have not had any desire to drink. It's a miracle for us, and I'm excited to see how much our life will change in the coming months, as alcohol has been the center of our universe for a long time. I can't recommend this enough for anyone feeling dependent on alcohol. Good luck to all.	10	December 20, 2018	102
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	"For me the old-fashioned, puritanical ""Alcoholics-Anonymous"" approach is a joke.  There IS medication for alcoholism.  Alcoholism is a genetic thing...not a lack of character development.  Take this medicine - it actually works!!!!!"	10	October 16, 2018	94
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	"I started the meds about 4 days ago. Went 2 days without drinking but cravings overwhelmed me. Of course I felt ashamed and like a hopeless failure. I hope that it will help me as much as all of these commenters. Maybe it will kick in with a little time. I""m desperate. Going to AA and to a therapist. Trying. Wish me luck."		October 15, 2018	49
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	55 year old. Drinking heavily for fifteen years. Tried campral for three months. OK to begin with but as it built up in my system it completely numbed all of my senses. I am normally an upbeat, happy person but it made me feel down all the time, tired, couldn't be bothered doing anything, lost interest in friends and family, memory loss to the point where I'd be having a conversation and couldn't recall words. And, probably the most embarrassing symptom, was that the muscle relaxant effect made me wet the bed twice which I have never done before (not alcohol induced). On researching this I saw that it is a common side effect but largely goes unreported for obvious reasons. It did however reduce my drinking, mainly because I was spaced out and zombified on campral and didn't need further intoxication.	2	October 10, 2018	34
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	"So, I was released from voluntary 51/50 ( a stay in hospital or institution) I'm a ""3 tall cans a night"" type of gal. The med is fantastic! I have no desire to drink. Only down side? I had a reaction to it. Ended up in the E.R.. I don't want to give up. I have hives. The Dr at the E.R. was no help. He just said, ""It's up to you, stop taking it or not."" help I don't wanna stop taking it but I also don't wanna die.   My throat closed up.  I need to look at other option like 	naltrexone, or antabuse."	10	September 27, 2018	3
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	I’m ashamed to say I was drinking too much .... I went voluntarily to my doctor for help and she suggested Campral along with counselling.  I had read the reviews and side effects etc and thought ok I’ll give it a try.   I HONESTLY can’t believe how this has worked for me.  It’s only been two weeks on Campral but I did change my drinking habits prior to starting Campral with a week completely off alcohol.  I don’t feel much desire to drink and  I had previously dreaded nighttime and weekends that had been the hardest for me but the Campral  worked so far.  I know every one is different  but I would urge you to give it a go , I just wish this was prescribed to my sister who sadly passed 8 years ago with alcohol dependence being a main factor, I’m sure it would have helped.   Good luck to all on their journey	10	September 20, 2018	51
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	I just started it and am feeling shaky and nauseous.  I also have a headache but am not sure if it's related.  Any guidance is greatly appreciated.  I'm not sure if I can keep taking it if it makes me feel this way.		September 17, 2018	14
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	It’s day two on Campral and it’s working ,but I am so bloated. Just wondering how long dies this side effect goes on for.	7	September 10, 2018	0
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	"This drug is an absolute miracle and a literal lifesaver. Like many here, I tried many times over the years to ""white knuckle"" getting sober and tried several rehabilitation programs, including AA. I was racked with guilt for being a failure and my marriage was on the rocks, to say the least. I'd be motivated to get clean, but always found a way be back to my old, heavy drinking ways pretty quickly.   With Campral, I simply have no real desire to drink. While my ""relapses"" used to be nightmarish, week-long benders, my one slip on Campral was just that -- a day where I had a few drinks. The next day -- no desire to drink and just back to life as normal.   No side effects I've ever noticed, except that I've lost a lot of weight from not drinking (a good thing in my case). I have no idea why this isn't prescribed as THE go-to medication for anyone struggling. Eleven stars if that were an option."	10	August 21, 2018	66
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	I was prescribed this in my 65th year. It worked very well but I have relapsed. Now I need it again but can't get a prescription in the UK .  Can anyone help me with how long I need NOT to drink before taking it again.   If I can't get in prescribed can  anyone suggest an alternative? Thanks	8	August 8, 2018	6
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	Hi I have been drinking since I was 15 years old and I am now 37 years old. It has only got worse as the years went on. To be honest, drinking 12/15 cans a night maybe 5 times a week.  Then I was introduced to campral and I said to myself why not.  I am not getting any younger plus my health is getting worse, so I started my first day today, so hopefully they work for me , it is only my first day so it too early to say much about my cravings, but I got thru today  so ok I suppose		August 7, 2018	18
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	I've been a heavy drinker for 25 years+.  Since my early 20's, I drank a magnum of wine daily. About four years ago, my Dr.s wanted me to stop. I've been to detox three times, inpatient once, intensive outpatient program (IOP) twice, DUI at 40, and fatty liver disease. AA is not my thing because I have social phobia I tried Antabuse but always relapsed with it still in my system.  Recently, I was on Vivitrol but drank the same amount, if not more.  I was starting to drink a fifth in one night, and I knew I couldn't continue because was killing me slowly.  My Dr suggested Campral.  My cravings aren't there and it's only been five days, but I've never had this experience before.  Usually, I'm climbing the walls in one way or another, and in the last few years, I've gained 50 pounds because I kept replacing alcohol with food every time I had sobriety.  This is different.  I just don't care about alcohol, and my family drinks heavily, and there are gallon bottles of booze on the counters.	9	July 20, 2018	53
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	I am 2 1/2 yrs sober. I did 16 weeks of treatment in early 2016 and 2+ yrs of weekly therapy along with weekly aftercare meetings. I still go to therapy just not as often. With all that said, I was on campral for the first year and then discontinued use and was fine. I've been back on it for 2 months as I was in a car accident in March 2018. My cravings since the accident were mostly for opioids but since I was familiar with how campral works in my body I chose to be put back on it instead of something for opioid cravings. Campral has helped save my life twice. I'll stay on it this time until things mellow out.  I guess why I'm writing this review is to tell people that this medications can help with cravings but the reasons why you used in the first place need to be addressed as well. I never would of stayed sober if I hadn't worked on my self to. This is a wonderful medication that works in tandem with other means of staying sober.	10	July 5, 2018	48
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	Doesn’t seem to work for me all that much. I’ve been on this a while 2 tablets of 333MG three times a day. It caused me to have allergic reactions too, such as hives and itching. The shakiness  (DT's )still has not gone away. I’m 22 days sober today from alcohol dependence. Prior to that I was clean for 60+ days and had a relapse only over the course of 8 days. So this detox shouldn’t be bad. Even with all these meds that I’m taking my anxiety becomes overwhelming sometimes and I feel like picking up a drink however I still haven’t and want to remain sober. So my doctor prescribed me a low does of Librium (25MG) and told me to take 1-2 times a day just until my symptoms are under control. I was taking visteral but it didn’t help enough for me personally. For me this alcohol craving pill might as well be a sugar pill	3	June 26, 2018	9
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	Yes, it works! I am from India and  have been a daily drinker for 10 years. Before starting acamprosate (Brand name Acamprol in my country), I detoxed for 5 days on benzos and then started its daily dose of 2*3. Cravings almost vanished within 2 days. On the 5th day I sat with friends who were having booze and couldn't care less to even look at it, forget thinking about it. Yesterday I ran short of its supply and by evening I was thinking of alcohol again. Will get my refill as soon as I finish this review. Give it a try, it works. I won't care even if I have to take it for a year, may be half the dose I will switch to. Give it a try guys. God bless.	9	June 24, 2018	11
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	I had relapsed 4-5 times after my first serious attempt to stop drinking. After starting campral, I have 7 months sober. I read these comments before starting and I’m glad I did. It’s working, I can walk into a liquor store and buy a soda! Cravings only appear during high stress, and they’re easier to fight now. They should try this on every alcoholic!	10	June 13, 2018	44
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	"I started taking Campral while in a treatment facility.  I was unable to tolerate naltrexone.  Although both addicted to alcohol and opioids the Campral is only used for alcohol dependence but this drug is nothing but amazing.  I have no cravings!  I take 666 mg. 3 times per day.  Started on 333 mg. I think this drug is best in a combination with cognitive behavioural therapy and a program such as AA or NA.  You have to want to deal with the addiction.  Nothing is a ""magic bullet"" I highly recommend this medication."	9	May 31, 2018	33
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	This drug has not been helpful. I have not taken it 3 times a day as prescribed though. I have had my usual amount of alcohol every day since I started it.  Today I am starting again ( for the hundredth time). I am going to take all three doses today. Starting to think there’s no help for me.	1	May 28, 2018	9
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	I have been reading the reviews for Campral for over a year and finally got over the embarrassment and asked my doctor. I started it four weeks ago and haven’t had a drink in three weeks. I knew there was no way I could go the recommended 5 days without alcohol because I’ve tried and the withdrawals were debilitating. So, I started it while I was still drinking. After a couple days on it I I had no desire to have beer, wine, margarita, nothing. I was drinking an entire bottle of wine and 6-7 beers nightly. And on the weekends I started drinking as soon as I finished my coffee and drank until blackout. Now, a month in I self-lowered my dose to 1/3 of what I started with and still no craving or withdrawal. I may be done even taking the rest of what I have left. Now I have the will power to even be around people drinking and just have a soda or tea. This medicine saved my life. For reference I’m a 40 year old female.	10	May 24, 2018	73
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	This is my second week only on Campral and since yesterday I don’t feel like drinking. I have no urge. I know is early days but I have been drinking since I was 15 now I’m 64 and the last three years I have been drinking close to 16 l of red wine . I’m so happy. I hope it continues. I will update again soon.		May 3, 2018	40
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	I had been a heavy drinker ever since I was about 19 or 20. I would drink pretty much any alcohol - to extreme every day. In the end I was drinking around 2 litres of port each day. Sometimes also wine, champagne, beer and/or spirits. Anything really, to excess.  I'm now 59 & have been alcohol-free for almost 2 years & no longer have any desire whatsoever to drink, thanks to Campral.  It truly is easy! I didn't need to join AA or have counselling or support groups. I did it by myself with just a little encouragement from my kids every now & then.  I honestly can't recommend it highly enough. I am no longer a dying alcoholic. My liver has returned from being just pre-cirrhosis and inches away from liver failure back to completely 100% healthy and normal.  Good luck & I hope this helps others who are caught up in that alcohol-dependent nightmare. :) xxx	10	April 7, 2018	87
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	This med worked EXTREMELY well taking away completely my craving for alcohol.	10	March 28, 2018	7
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	Am 73 and have been consistent drinker since 18 and would love $1 for every hangover over those years. The  secret is after  taking this for 3-4 days you just don’t think about drinking and you no longer crave or miss it . It’s like when observing others who are regular full on daily boozers, thinking they don’t know what life is really about and they are shackled somehow and ruining  and missing out on life’s real genuine pleasures and purposes. I now have just as much enjoyment with still social /heavy drinker friends by just having a tea or coffee and have for first time since I was a kid some real respect and confidence in myself.	10	March 25, 2018	42
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	I waited for 5 days without alcohol. Tomorrow will be my start date. I plan to update weekly History is over a third of my life alcoholic	10	February 3, 2018	19
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	First time in 3 years I haven’t had a drink for 3 weeks....but most importantly I haven’t WANTED to drink. I truly thought I was destined to keep destroying myself and my families lives forever. I’d given up hope! I must say though I have taken this med before DURING a drinking binge and it does very little but once you have made a decision to stop completely it’s amazing.....0 cravings and a total indifference to alcohol when I am around it! Only side effect I had was a bit of drowsiness and forgetfulness which soon disappeared  Give it a try!!	10	February 2, 2018	3
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	I was put on campral and coming up to 10 weeks without a drink. Was drinking to blackout 4/5 times a week . Not sure how it works but it is sure not doing any harm. I also had a strong desire to stop (this has failed me many times before though) No side effects. Certainly glad I have tried it.	8	February 2, 2018	24
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	I started using Campral 7 months + ago to help me stop drinking and it has been a godsend. It’s still taken some effort but been much much easier than I’d dared hope. I’m getting my life back and changing it as well. I don’t ever want go back. If you are thinking about quitting  drinking then this med is worth a try although I understand it doesn’t work for everyone. Have also been taking Baclofen with it and planning to stay on both for a year.	9	December 28, 2017	61
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	I've been a heavy drinker for 10+ years and finally decided to quit with the help of Campral.  I am 45 days sober and Campral has stopped all the cravings I used to have.  I have been taking 1 pill 3 times a day and that has been working well.	9	December 20, 2017	25
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	From my mid 20’s until I was 51 I was a fully functioning binge drinker - 1 bottle of wine every night. The only time I was sober was when I was pregnant with my beautiful daughter and for 1 year after she was born. I eventually got to the stage where I was drinking 2 bottles of wine per night and completely blacking out. I went into hospital for a Librium detox in June 2012. When I left hosp I was prescribed Campral 333 x 2 three times daily. Five and a half years later I am still completely sober and have never looked back. I was on Campral for 1 year - fantastic drug. Please ask your Dr to prescribe you with it - it changed my life. Good luck.	10	December 17, 2017	8
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	Went Cold Turkey off this drug almost killed me.  I had serious shakes, chills, muscle spasms, body felt limp hallucinations crazy feeling scary nightmares	1	December 8, 2017	0
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	I was a very heavy drinker from 6am til lights out everyday, week, month, year for the last 10 years. I had never driven my cars at night because I was always drunk. I drank approximately 7,300 beers last year alone (20 a day) I wanted to get off the merry go round so I went to my local doctor and told him my plans and fears. He prescribed Campral, The instructions were NOT to consume alcohol while taking the medicine. Well I was drunk so on the Sat night I took the first 3 pills. The next morning I woke up and thought about having a beer after coffee but seemed okay not having one. That was 2 weeks ago and I still have not had a beer. Brilliant medicine. I quit smoking 2 days later. Campral seems to help with that as well.		December 8, 2017	40
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	I’m a 43 year old guy living in the uk. I’ve been a regular big drinker since the age of 24.  Always liked the buzz I got off drinking, always drank till I was totally out of it.  Done drink driving four times, the last time I should have been banged up but somehow got away with it, bolloxed up a few relationships along the way through it. In the early years it was fun but it’s destroyed and damaged the last 10 years of my life. Currently in a relationship with someone I love very much and respect a great deal, I’m doing this for both of us. My GP wouldn’t prescribe so going through a referred clinic to get campral after hearing all these uplifting sucess stories from people. Hope it works for me as it did for you. Getting it this Friday	10	November 9, 2017	23
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	Apart from a few years where I switched to speed I've been a binge drinker for over 20 years. Recently the binges have been more frequent and lasting longer. After the truly awful withdrawal  symptoms subsided I'd last a few days at most before beer started calling my name again. As the saying goes I got sick and tired of being sick and tired. I discovered campral by accident and it's as close to a miracle as you can get. I'm amazed. That voice inside my head is finally silent!	10	November 5, 2017	38
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	I'd been drinking for years and it got very heavy on the last two years and worse so in the last 6 months.   I failed with antabuse and doctor switched me just this week to this drug. It's been amazing. I went for a few social beers which were planned but I couldn't be bothered with drinking. I would normally have drank until I blacked out but I barely had any urge to drink anything. I had beers in the fridge and normally I would have drank them also after getting home, I woke up they were untouched and I just poured them down the sink.   It works!!	9	October 28, 2017	37
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	"At the end, I was drinking a fifth of vodka daily, sometimes more.  Was pretty excited about the Sinclair Method using Naltrexone, but it didn't work for me as it did for others.  Two trips to the psych ed with debilitating depression fuelled by alcohol, one inpatient stint and one rehab later, my psychiatrist prescribed Campral.  I'm two weeks in and the worst ""craving"" was thinking about drinking prior to the holiday weekend.  I used my other supports and didn't drink.  I also take gabapentin 600mg three times daily and Zoloft 200mg nightly to help with anxiety and depression.    (This rating would be a 10, but I've had diarrhea for a few days after upping my dose to 666mg 3x/day.)"	9	September 3, 2017	31
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	I have been taking this for 3 weeks now following a librium detox, I was drinking 3 to 4 bottles of red wine each day, sometimes more. Since taking Campral 3 times a day I haven't had a drink, nor have I wanted to. I  have been out socially with others and had diet Pepsi, people have commented on how well I look, even those who didn't know that I was undertaking detox and I have lost 9 pounds in weight, this is an amazing drug, I was drinking throughout the night and day pretty continuously and I haven't craved a drop.	10	August 24, 2017	67
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	I have been on acamprosate for a few days to prevent a relapse. I don't get cravings, but after being on this, I don't get cravings for anything. I have lost all interest in everything and have no motivation. I am tired, nauseous and dizzy and have no desire to do absolutely anything. Please tell me this goes away.	5	August 18, 2017	6
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	I lost everything after 35 years hard drinking.Went to rehabs and AA. I  don't want to tell everyone I'm an alcoholic every day when I try to put things past tense. 3 days on campral and yep its gold. sober 4 months and hey a bit of diarrhea  ; but at least I can remember pooping myself. Lets do it. Shane	8	August 17, 2017	21
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	All be honest I took this and nothing maybe it's all the other meds I take but took this for alcohol and drank alcohol while on it And nothing felt no reduced cravings		July 29, 2017	11
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	I am just checking in again.  I started campral and naltrexone last fall after drinking for years, failing the traditional in-patient treatment/AA way...... I am now nearly 10 months without a drink.  I don't really crave alcohol.  Occasionally a stressful situation will come up and I will think about drinking, but that passes quickly because I just don't have the cravings or desire.  My life is so fulfilling.  It's not without it's challenges, which is why I have regular counselling in order to recognize and deal with what issues I let alcohol take care of.  I truly do wake up thankful for this relief.	10	July 15, 2017	63
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	I've been on this before and it works.  The thing is if you take this for a week, then you slip in a drink...you will not feel that intoxication that you crave and are addicted to. This drug also keeps a person from feeling the euphoria associated with opioids.		July 11, 2017	35
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	"I was immediately put on the suggested  333mg x2 tabs-three times a day ..as soon as I started my community Detox; which included Librium. It is early days here BUT the change in me is enormous. I drank since 20...a ""binge drinker"" or so I thought!!. I was unable to Stop. I'm Lucky to be alive . Once a car I was in went over a precipice but still I craved the alcohol.  The craving was pure hell. Now at 56-I feel finally freed out a prison of craving something that would have killed me . THANK YOU CAMPRAL. People In AA had given up on me and I'd given up too...till Campral. "	9	June 24, 2017	81
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	Absolutely amazing I am 60 and been a heavy drinker all my life At least one to one and a half  bottles of wine per nite Two or three bottles per day on a weekend plus beer or anything else if I was out After I started taking this I noticed the difference the very next day Within a few days I was having alcohol free days  Within 3 weeks I was going for a week or more without a drink but started drinking a lot of mineral water At 6  weeks I was not even thinking about alcohol After 4 mths I stopped the tablets At six mths I have no craving at all If I am out with friends I will have a red wine occasionally and stop ( could not do this previously )might have a red once every 10 days or so but am completely in control I am still absolutely astounded how well they worked for me	10	June 7, 2017	83

Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	My partner has been a heavy drinker for over 5 years now, and within the last 12 months it officially began to get out of control, leading him into the hospital 3 times for an acute attack of pancreatitis. It got to the point where I was going to leave him cause he just wouldn't stop. He also lost his license from drink driving and almost went to jail because of it. It got up to him drinking 700ml-1lt of scotch every day AND going out on top of it before he decided he wanted help. At first he promised me he could ween himself off on his own (don't they all), and obviously he wasn't successful. So his doctor put him on Campral. It has been 9 days now and he has had 1 beer with dinner. He says he just doesn't have the desire to drink anymore.	8	May 25, 2017	64
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	"My Dr prescribed this medication at my request and it has helped me considerably. I used to drink every day around that ""happy hour"" time. I would drink hard alcohol of my choice for that week. I drank about 6-8 shot per night.  I have been on Campral a week shy of two months. I have drank on two occasions but did not have the urge to drink it was a matter of just wanting a drink and seeing how Campral will work after the fact. I did not feel the urge to keep drinking the days after I drank on these two occasions. This medication works wonders for me and my family. They have me back. I recommend you try it out. I feel no side affects taking Campral. I can't even tell I have added this medication to my daily meds.  Kim"	10	May 9, 2017	75
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	I've been relapsing since I started drinking 10 years ago. I tried Campral, but didn't bother to take it as prescribed, often forgetting. After my 3rd rehab, and years of AA and counselling, this has been the most amazing medication I've ever taken. I had zero hope it would work, given it didn't before (again, even tho I forgot to take it sometimes), but it has been a miracle. I mean a miracle. I can walk through the grocery store, see the liquor area, and not be have any desire to drink. I have a three particular triggers I cannot avoid, and have always relapsed due to them. However, I no longer feel the desire to drink now when experiencing them. I go to counselling and DBT, but nothing worked before. Do yourself a favor and try it.	10	May 4, 2017	74

Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	Only 1 week on this 1 pill 3 times a day. I haven't drank anything, but I haven't been in any situations that I would drink yet. I'm a binge drinker. At home I don't drink at all. If I'm out at a casino or bowling I'll go nuts and forget what happens the next day.	5	April 9, 2017	16
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	"Hello, I have been a ""functioning alcoholic"" for 20 years.   Drinking a bottle of wine a day.   I have tried Naltrexone twice but each time was unable to tolerate the side effects of nausea and dizziness and did not continue treatment.   For the times I was able to take Naltrexone, it did not curb my consumption and I easily drank right through it.     Presently, I am trying Campral but also find it ineffective for cravings - even though I take the recommended dosage of 333mg x 2, three times daily.   I have been taking for some time now and still experience the same level of cravings.   I do not experience any side effects from this medication nor an accelerated hangovers."	1	April 6, 2017	4
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	I tried and tried the AA way and it just didn't work. I was told over and over to attempt treatment and I did, four times.  Treatment is extremely overrated.  I finally took it upon myself to investigate other options and discovered acamprosate and naltrexone.  I am now 5 months without drinking and am so, so happy.  I have regular counselling and discovered that AA cannot address the underlying reasons why a person drinks...in my case, PTSD.  AA made me feel like a huge failure.  I am aggravated that over a one year period no one even thought to offer me the option to take these meds.  I am on a mission now to share my successful experience with these drugs with others.	10	February 21, 2017	156
Acamprosate	Alcohol Dependence	Campral worked as prescribed for me, it gives me relief from the cravings, I didn't feel it was working until I realised that for the first time in years I had reached two weeks with out a drink, the habitual side of drinking is powerful and every time I was triggered it felt on par with a craving. My advice, keep with the Campral even if you feel its not working, give it time, let it do its thing, it will alleviate the cravings which will give you some breathing space to work on the habit itself, my synopsis, Campral will help with half the battle the rest needs counselling, will power and time. Side effects minimal for me, Campral is an excellent tool to stay on the road to recovery, one in my opinion not recommended enough.	9	February 18, 2017	101
Acb	Computed Tomography	"I've had plenty of CTs with IV contrast before, but not oral contrast, so I decided to look up what to expect.  Mistake.  The internet hyped this up as being sludgy cement that tastes awful, and that I should expect to immediately fight the urge to vomit or soil myself. I had the Vanilla Silq flavor/brand, cold, and it was almost indistinguishable from a vanilla Ensure, save for the knowledge it was mildly radioactive but unlikely to grant superpowers.  Everyone reacts differently, but most people who had their expectations met at Chili's don't post reviews about it, so you won't find a lot of ""everything went fine and normal and I'm going about my day"" posts about barium sulfate. You'll see the nasty and unfortunate stuff though.  Anyway, worst milkshake I've ever had but had no real fallout from it - no nausea or diarrhea, but time will tell about constipation - and would recommend drinking this as infrequently as your doctor will let you."	8	December 9, 2020	7
Acb	Computed Tomography	I had my CT scan today, I had to drink the barium sulphate...  I’ve had constant diarrhoea for 7 hours now. My stomach sounds like there’s a thunderstorm inside.		September 3, 2020	11
Acb	Computed Tomography	Tasted sweet, not too bad. Had a couple bouts of diarrhea but nothing severe and resolved within a day!	8	August 26, 2020	2
Acb	Computed Tomography	I had to drink one bottle of the Berry smoothie wasn't as bad as what my coworkers told me it would taste like. Had a hard time getting it down because it made me feel full very quickly. Almost made me vomit. The rest of the day went ok other than a major headache. The next day I couldn't stop going to the bathroom, but the nurse did say if I hadn't had a bowel movement in 48 hours to call my GP, needless to say I haven't had to call her.	8	August 25, 2020	3
Acb	Computed Tomography	This poison gave me non stop diarrhea for 12 Damn days. I couldn;t leave my house. They need to put a big WARNING this JUNK. It caused severe bowel inflammation and non stop trips to the bathroom, many hardly in time. It's awful. 12 days living in a nightmare . No warning given to me. No warning on the container it came in., WHY NOT?	1	December 26, 2019	15
Acb	Computed Tomography	I had the oral and IV contrast and was told I could go to work after the CT scan. I asked about side effects but was told about the major ones not the vomiting and diarrhea. I went to work and got very sick. It was so embarrassing. I had to rush home and almost kicked my house door down getting to the bathroom. The nausea, diarrhea, weakness, tingling in my body was so scary. I was in the bathroom every 5 minutes. That was on Tuesday now here it is Thursday and I am still nausea and can taste the medication in my mouth. My stomach still bubbles up when I eat anything. This is a weight loss plan I didn't sign up for. This experience made me feel worse than what I originally went in for. Never again will I do something like that without doing my research first.	2	September 19, 2019	16
Acb	Computed Tomography	The taste of barium sulfate was unpleasant but bearable. The following day I was so constipated that my husband considered calling 911. It felt like a metal pipe rupturing my anus. My husband had to administer mineral oil enema up my rectum in order to relieve myself. I am a newlywed—how humiliating 	5	August 14, 2019	9
Acb	Computed Tomography	Horrible taste. The flavor of artificial sweeteners was overwhelming. I can't tolerate artificial sweeteners. A couple of hours after drinking I had explosive diarrhea. It was terrible my stomach was cramping and I barely made it to the bathroom on several occasions. I won't drink it again.	4	July 31, 2019	9
Acb	Computed Tomography	No no no no! So I guess I got the orange flavor. And this was the worst thing I’ve ever had to drink in my life. The flavor wasn’t bad. But the consistency was horrible. Just too thick for me to take at once. I sat there with my Powerade and crackers trying to get it down. I spit it out twice because I was on the verge of throwing up. I’m not a dramatic person by any means, but I wish there was an easier way to prep for a CT. I get to take another bottle in the morning. Not looking forward to it	1	March 7, 2019	8
Acb	Computed Tomography	Had no issues at all drinking readi cat 2.  I read reviews it which  had me worried but no side effects - nothing, so no worries. I hope my post helps	10	January 22, 2019	28
Acb	Computed Tomography	Drank 2 bottles, one last night and one this morning an hour before a CT of my chest, abdomen, and pelvis.  Vanilla flavor wasn't awful and I didn't have any bad reaction other than some gas, feelings of constipation, and tiredness.  Was instructed to drink plenty of water to flush it all out of my system.  Drank it chilled and that seemed to help with the taste.  Still had iodine through an IV too so hopefully the imaging will accurate and clear.	8	December 1, 2018	16
Acb	Computed Tomography	I made it threw the first bottle pretty good. The taste wasnt bad at all (had the berry flavor)  but the consistency is just gross. About 10 min later had a huge hit of diarrhea. After half of the second bottle i must have looked white like a ghost as everybody asked me if i was okay and i felt super sick to my stomach. It was hard to keep it down. After the scan i threw up about 8 times and had diarrhea ALL day long. Couldnt drive myself home, husband had to pick me up. I felt so weak. Also having a lot of gas and a huge headache. I am sure its needed but i hope i never have to do this again.	5	September 8, 2018	12
Acb	Computed Tomography	Here I lay Thursday having drunk two bottles of Ready-CAT2 oral (1 Sunday and 1 early Monday morning).  I think I am having a reaction to the READY-CAT2 .After drinking one bottle, I felt very full, somewhat nauseous and just rather bad. (Achy joints, intestinal tightness). I called the imaging place the next morning (Monday) and was told to drink the 2nd bottle anyway. I have been having problems with IBS -C and here it is Wednesday 2 am. I was so dizzy and sweaty during the night and now I am dizzy and shaky too. I have not managed to get the READY-CAT Smoothie out of my system and it feels like I swallowed concrete.  I will call both  PCP, GI and Imaging place when they open. My suggestion to others might be to discuss taking READY-CAT Smoothie with the doctor for guidance before taking it, especially if you are already constipated. The vanilla smoothie tastes good but has sorbitol in it. I am obviously sensitive to something in this and know sorbitol is probably one.	5	August 9, 2018	12
Acb	Computed Tomography	"Had this for a abdominal CT. Was like a orange creamsickle,  but by no means ""good"" just better than expected. No heartburn, or cramps thus so far, 9 hrs past taking it.  I do have a metallic taste in mouth, but not sure if it's the readicat, or iodine I had as an injected contrast as well. May just be nerves.   In all, it was not bad."	10	May 5, 2018	12
Acb	Computed Tomography	I took the Vanilla Flavored and it wasn’t as bad as I thought it would be. Drank one bottle 3 hours prior to the scan, another 1/2 bottle an hour before the scan, a 1/2 bottle 30 minutes prior to the scan and another cup immediately prior to the scan. I had been expecting diarrhea, and was surprised to find it made me constipated. I kept drinking water, however, and finally went about 3-4 hours later. If it all helps to find out the problem, it’s definitely worth it!	10	January 16, 2018	10
Acb	Computed Tomography	I had the banana flavor and it was a BIG improvement from the old days of just drinking chalk!  However, it was thick and at times unpleasant.  I had to gag down 2 large servings, plus they administered an iodine IV during the CT scan.  About 45 minutes after the procedure, it all hit and I was in the bathroom for the next several hours.  Not sure if it was the barium or iodine, but this was one of the common side effects and worth it to find out what's going on inside me or for prevention!	8	January 13, 2018	13
Acb	Computed Tomography	Didn't taste bad at all. You just have to take it!. Did give me diarrhea though.	10	November 2, 2017	6
Acb	Computed Tomography	Orange flavor wasn't bad but a little orange food coloring might have made the illusion a bit more convincing.  Medium thick but went down without much problem. Technician assured me it was light years better than the chalky mix they used to use.  Then got an injection of an unnamed diuretic and urination every 5 minutes began. Not sure if it was completely the diuretic or the barium was a contributor but it continued right up to PET time. I warned them so they procured a plastic urinal and wrapped an diaper around me on the table. Neither got used during the 15 minute scan but it took a lot of clenched sphincter action to prevent a mess. Ten seconds off the table the urinal got used.	7	October 8, 2017	9
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	I've been taking clonazepam for about eight years for social anxiety, OCD, and PTSD. I usually take 0.25mg or 0.5mg a few times a week. Pros: It helps my anxiety tremendously. It makes it so much easier to socialize and focus. It helped me accomplished things I never thought I would.  Cons: It impairs my memory a little bit and makes me a bit sleepy.  Also, if I take it too many days in a row or at higher dosages, I experience depressive symptoms, namely a lack of motivation and trouble feeling pleasure.   All in all, if you have really intense anxiety that hinders your ability to function in daily life, I'd recommend this medication. However, I personally prefer not to take high dosages or take it too frequently, as that can cause depression. Also, be aware that the drug can be extremely hard to get off of due to physical dependence/withdrawal symptoms.	8	April 29, 2021	0
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	I just read a review from TexMex.  I was so happy to see that someone else is taking a super low dose (.125mg). I take this dose once or twice a week. Sometimes I can go a week or two without taking any.  I started keeping a journal to look for triggers.  I finally discovered situations that would trigger an attack (sometimes, not always). I have started taking .125 mg before going into these situations and 90% of my anxiety is gone.  I feel somewhat normal again.  For those of you complaining about feeling sleepy, try taking a little less than what is prescribed.  It might not work for you, but with this drug less is better. Good Luck and Thanks TexMex!!	10	April 19, 2021	4
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	For panic attacks and general anxiety, this drug is awesome!  I have kept this drug in my home for about 15 years.  I go months without it.  However, when anxiety hits, I can take .5mg and I get relief within 20-30 min.  I have taken 1 mg at night to sleep during these times.  I might take this drug several days in a row.  Then I can go long periods of time without it again.  It is a life saver for me.	10	April 19, 2021	5
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	Mild to moderate anxiety attacks. My doctor prescribed 0.25 mg as needed. If I take one it calms me down but I’m sleepy. I have been taking 0.125 mg 2-3 days a week. It’s all I need to take the edge off. Twice my anxiety has been bad enough to take an extra .125 mg a few hours after the first dose. I have never taken more than that.	10	April 17, 2021	6
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	My doctor gave me a prescription one year ago for anxiety.  It says to take .25-.5 mg daily as needed.  I am scared to get hooked on this drug.  I didn't take it for a long time.  Then one day I had bad stress and anxiety.  I finally took .25 mg. It worked but it made me very sleepy.  I don't want something that knocks me out! I just want to feel normal.  The next time I was feeling anxiety/stress, I took .125 mg. (1/4 of a .5mg tablet) This was perfect for me.  It didn't make be sleepy, but I felt calm after an hour of taking it.  I am a petite woman so maybe a smaller dose is all I need.  I can always take another .125 mg if I need to. I'm still afraid of the drug, but as long as I don't take it every day it might be ok.  My doctor says if I can get by on such a tiny dose I will be fine.	10	April 15, 2021	5
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	I am a middle aged guy who suffers from panic attacks. I was put on .0.5 mg of klonopin and l must say this is a miracle drug. I couldn't be more happier.	9	March 23, 2021	6
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	I never took an aspirin until 3 years ago when not only did I suffer trauma and the ensuing PTSD at the ripe old age of 60, but I also was diagnosed with an incurable, chronic autoimmune disease.  I am now 63 and after having tried multiple SSRI's, which do nothing, I was prescribed clonazapam.  I take 1 mg once a day.  I was warned about all the side effects....dependency, tolerance, etc and quite frankly, I do not care. If this drug keeps me alive and calms my thoughts, and makes me want to live.  My dr is in full agreement with taking this for the rest of my days.  Quality of life versus quantity....I have no intention of coming off of it...therefore withdrawal will not be an issue.	10	March 22, 2021	29
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	This med provides instant relief for my anxiety and negative thoughts.  I only take 2 mg every other day but of course my doctor wants me off of it because it causes dependency and dementia.  Well there are a lot of meds including over the counter sleep aids that have been linked to dementia and aren't controlled substances.  Have taken antidepressants in the past for anxiety and currently trying another that has yet to kick in.  They either don't work for me or cause awful side effects.  For some people, Benzos are the only thing that keeps them calm.  I can focus, relax, dive into tasks I put off, be social, and it also helps with pain and I can sleep better.  I hope this medication is not outlawed.	10	March 17, 2021	15

Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	Trex03 I highly doubt you will see this. I really wish you could reply to people on here. I’ve had my issues with anxiety for a very a long time for generalized to onset panic attacks the list goes on. One of the main reasons I started looking at the reviews was to see if anyone had opinions on different generics unfortunately for me from what I’ve read so far not with this only effects and there overall experience which is good just not what I was looking for. Your post was from so long ago I am sure you figured out something + will never see this but hopefully it helps someone. I found that only manufacturer that works for me with least side effect & doesn’t feel like I am taking 1/2 when taking a full 1 is the manufacture TEVA. It does take a little work looking around to find who carries it depending where you go may special order it usually not big name pharms. Though TEVA’s Klonopin has worked best for me  and even go out of my way to make sure that what I’m getting	8	March 9, 2021	1
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	This medicine is a godsend if you do not have addictive qualities.  I thank God that my tolerance to this drug does NOT increase. I have taken higher doses that would cause non-users severe amnesia (2-4mg) and they actually do not work hardly any better than just a simple .5mg dose. If you are struggling with anxiety I would highly recommend taking this with perhaps celexa, and do not think twice about trying a regimen of 3 times per day. Yes, in the morning it does not cause me drowsiness. Clonazepam saved my life: got rid of rapid mood swings, gave me hope that I could calm down, and no intense withdrawals or cravings. Saved me from having to take antipsychotics for agitation and saved my marriage. The prescription guidelines for this drug are too harsh because of the general drug crisis and short acting Benzos. The prescribing guidelines specifically say that it does help a certain population with daily use, your average doctor simply doesn't want to deal with you. Blessings to all.	9	January 22, 2021	21
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	Clonazepan is very good medicine for anxiety. Works on me, every body are different.	10	January 15, 2021	13
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	I just began having what feels like some kind of delayed reaction to weaning off of Effexor. Then I was given Clonazepam to control anxiety & agitation and this med has driven my symptoms off the chart. I’ve gone from anxious and agitated to feeling like an enraged destructive moose. I am walking 3 & 4 times a day just to try & calm myself. When I take this med I loose all sense of coordination, not from being dizzy, I just can’t maintain my balance.	1	January 7, 2021	5
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	This was the best anti anxiety medication I have ever experienced. I was on it for 20 years. I had zero side effects and it was not habit forming.	10	December 31, 2020	34
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	On klonopin/clonozepam 1mg ODT for 4 years for chronic pain. It didn't relax me or anything but compared to many other medicine it took a couple points from my chronic pain in the right side of the face. Not a miracle drug for me but not immediate side-effects compared to others so I kept using it. For ODT specifically I would develop small clear bumps (mouth ulcers) under my tongue and on the insides of the cheeks. They would go away after few days but one stayed there for over a year. I had to do punch biopsy on it. When I tried to lookup if anyone else have such symptoms I couldn't find anything. So I'm posting it here. If you try to switch the location of where the ODT dissolves a couple days later a new clear bump will be there. The drug blocks minor salivary glands which we have a few hundreds all over the mouth. Sometimes it blocks them for good leaving you with permanent bumps that fill up with saliva irritate you and then burst after a few days only to repeat a cycle a few days later. Beware.	1	December 24, 2020	5
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	This medicine is one of the best medicine for anxiety and PTSD. It helps very little for my fibro but so thankful. I can cope with my other medical issues way better. If it would not be for this med I would be dead now.	10	December 14, 2020	41
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	Klonopin works great for my anxiety and OCD, it's better then any prescription out there including SSRI,I just don't understand why they don't give this too people with anxiety	10	December 8, 2020	35
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	Been taking clonazepam for a decade. 2mg per day, was at 6mg per day max a few years back. Helps tremendously. Tolerance for me doesn’t increase like other Benzos like Ativan and Xanax does. Negative side effects are very few other than maybe dry mouth.	10	October 18, 2020	43
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	I take .5mg of clonazepam  1-3 times per week as needed for anxiety, panic, OCD and insomnia.  It works gloriously.  Some nights when Lunesta will not get me over the sleep hump, I'll take 1/4 of a .5mg tablet and then I can sleep through the night without racing thoughts.  Only side effect I've noticed is hair shedding.	10	September 5, 2020	29
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	I was on 0.5 - 1mg Klonopin daily for GAD and panic disorder for 6.5 years. Knowing what I know now about benzodiazepines, I'm not sure how my doctors ever let this fly. They should only be prescribed for short-term use (or on a PRN basis only), and certainly not daily use for YEARS on end. Withdrawals were a nightmare and it took months for me to feel back to normal again. When people talk about the withdrawals, they aren't joking... and this was with a SLOW AND STEADY taper!! Benzos like Klonopin absolutely serve a purpose and work very well, just make sure you take it daily short-term or if you are on it for a prolonged period of time, only as needed!	5	August 23, 2020	38
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	On Klonopinfor anxiety and insomnia. Klonopin saved my life. It also improved every relationship I treasure.  I've taken it for 8 years and my work has improved, my relationships have improved and I'm more relaxed.  Also, my base dose has NOT increased beyond 1.0 mg a day.  Often it's just .25mg a day.  Personally, I don't have any plan to stop taking it.  My wife says I'm better in everyday on it...including the bedroom. So there....:)	10	August 21, 2020	82
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	On clonazepam To treat my Restless Leg Syndrome and anxiety. Finally I feel normal and I am seizure free. Combine with dopamine and serotonin reuptake meds also gabapentine, I can't describe the normal feeling for the first time and no insomnia (for more than 20 years). But sadly after my neurologist reduce the dosage, I feel terrible. I don't know if this is withdrawal. But I'm thankful for this med.	10	August 14, 2020	23
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	I've always taken clonazepam as prescribed for severe anxiety. Tolerance developed quickly and Drs kept upping my dose while adding other medications. Up until 2 years ago I would have given it a 10 as  I had no idea what was happening or coming at me. It has messed up my blood pressure and I have tachycardia now so I need to get off it. THIS IS AWFUL. I have been on 1 mg 2 x daily and down to 1.5 a day. I don't know if I can get to 1 mg a day. Believe every horror story on here because if you ever want/need off this ride you better buckle up.  Find another way. Don't make this an option.	1	July 29, 2020	34
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	Ive been on numerous medications over the last 20 years. Including xanax. About 15 years ago my doctor put me on klonopin. For the first time I felt better. About 5 years later I switched insurance company's and had my new doctor switch me to xanax. Which worked fine. After that I've had about  4 different psychiatrist and none of them liked xanax so they took me off of them. And put me on other meds that did not work. So I've suffered for the last 4 years. I have PTSD and anxiety. Finally I just got a new psychiatrist and she put me back on klonopin. And I'm so relieved.  I feel so much better. Don't let anyone tell you its a bad medication. I never had withdrawals years ago when I quit taking them. They have helped me better than any other medication.		June 26, 2020	103
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	This clonazepam has been a godsend for me. I have severe anxiety and possible panic disorder, so whenever I feel really bad anxiety I take 0.5 mg and feel better within 20-35 minutes. It can also help me sleep sometimes, which is a plus.  The only con is that if you take this during the day (I've had to many times) you WILL get drowsy. Other than that, this medication has been amazing for me. I'd definitely recommend it, although everybody is different.	9	June 9, 2020	78
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	This medicine helped me a lot with my problem which is caused by anxiety. I couldn't sleep so my psychiatrist told me to take 1/4 before going to sleep. Now I am afraid that I am addicted.	9	June 6, 2020	30
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	I’ve been taking this drug and the same amount for 6 yrs , I had the addiction discussion with my Dr . His attitude is I take heart medication which I depend on  I take Clonazepam for a heath issue  And I depend on it . I have no side effects and I live a normal life because of it , for me it’s been a very positive game changer . I take .250 mg three times a day , three days on and one day off ,	10	March 8, 2020	98
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	"While it did seem to help anxiety, it didn't take me too long on it to notice that I was having strong self-destructive desires while taking this drug.  The warning on google (for klonopin) says clearly under the controlled substance area ""Can cause paranoid or suicidal ideation"" which is the kind of thing I was experiencing on this.  One or two days off of this drug, and the self-destructive thoughts went away.  Once I stayed off it a few weeks, those thoughts seemed to stay away too.  I just wish I could find another way to deal with the anxiety now, though."	2	March 7, 2020	17
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	I developed anxiety years ago. Tried SSRI meds but they gave me such bad migraines that the doctor was afraid I’d stroke out. After prescribing me Clonazepam .5mg that I take as needed, it has helped me so much.  I don’t have any bad side effects and I can function normally. I’m thankful for it.	10	March 4, 2020	59
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	Klonopin 0.5 mgs has been a life savor.  I take it twice a day. No more horrible panic attacks. Really helps my anxiety. I have been on this for years. Never had the desire to take more, because it works for me.   This worked great for me!!	10	March 3, 2020	69
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	I am 27 years old and my psychiatrist prescribed my Clonazepam 2 years ago when my anxiety and sleep deprivation got out of control. I was prescribed 0.5mg 1-2x daily as needed, but usually taking 1/2-1 (0.25-0.5mg) tablet does the trick. Never had an addiction issue, never had any issues stopping or taking long breaks off of this medication. I don’t abuse it and truly only take the bare minimum as needed.   I had tolerance issues with lorazepam and Xanax, where I felt like even after a week, I had to continuously increase my dose, but never with Clonazepam. 0.25-0.5mg is perfect when I do take it.  Like with any medication, you just have to be careful and know the risks. I’m grateful that my psychiatrist gave me something that helps. Without this medication I would not be able to function socially, go to work or sleep on my bad days.	10	March 3, 2020	80
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	This is a miracle drug for me.  I was on it for 7 years and slowly worked my way off of it 9 weeks ago.  Taking 3 months to get off of it.  I had the past 9 week be the most awful; it took me till last week to figure out it was anxiety.  I could eat, sleep or concentrate.  Within 8 hours of my doctor writing me the script. I was back to my normal self!	10	February 27, 2020	38
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	I get annoyed when I google Klooipin and all I see is scare tactic's of how its so dangerous.  It's has been a life saver for me for the last 5 years.  I never abused it or ever even got the slightest remote high from it.  I take 2MG in the morning and 2 MG after 5PM. It literally saved my career as the level of anxiety that come over me was horrible and the only drug that stop my heart from pounding out of my chest is klonopin.	10	February 24, 2020	151
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	I’ve been on Klonopin or Paxam or Revotril which is the Australian brands, for about a year and a half, 2mg a day for severe social anxiety. I tried countless SSRI’s and Valium and Ativan weren’t strong enough. My Psych tried  to put me on Seroquel or Zyprexa to get me off but I declined. This medication works wonders for me. I can see my friends, go out to bars/ pubs and generally do my normal daily tasks like working and driving. The enormous downfall is that they are incredibly addictive and the potential for abuse is massive, plus the withdrawals don’t get me started can make you crazy and can be life threatening. You just need to have self control and take it EXACTLY as your doctor tells you to. Otherwise you’re in big trouble. This is a beast of a Benzo (not anywhere near as bad as Xanax) and not to be played with. All the best to those who are trying it!	9	February 15, 2020	44
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	What should I ask or how should I ask my doctor that the clonazepam that I have been taking for a few years now is not working and I am just getting worse, I have very bad Anxiety and Manic Depression. It's isn't getting better but worse?	7	January 31, 2020	30
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	I have been having constant panic attacks with my reduced dose of Klonopin to 1/2 pill twice a day of the 0.5mg.  I have seen a few different dr.s and I m going back to someone who knows me instead of a stranger that has called my ex husband and left me out in the cold. I have used 2 pills this month to get ahold of my panic and will probably be a couple of days without meds .I don't know what to do since SSRI s don't agree with me	7	January 29, 2020	11
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	clonazepam is very effective for anxiety, however dependence  and tolerance can develop quickly to some of the effects. Essential to take it in accordance with the medical information provided regarding dosage, side effects and the maximum recommended length of time period can be taken. Longer use can expose you to unexpected mental health  issues. Make sure you always mention to your doctor if you take this medication even if using just intermittently.	6	January 18, 2020	17
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	I don’t normally write these out, but I’ll make an exception here.  Let me start off by saying I only gave it 8 stars because, yes, your body does become addicted to it. I ran out. Once. Tried this “mindfulness” junk for a week before it hit me like a truck. Next thing I know I go from ok to in the ER getting injections of Ativan for my BP being 180/140 and Heart rate off the charts. After the Ativan I was perfect in 10 minutes with a BP of 117/80 and 80 pulse.  THAT being said, there’s no denying the drug works. And it works pretty darn good. I had a heart attack at 30 years old. After that experience I developed GAD and it just gotten worse over time. Unfortunately, Klonopin is the only drug that keeps this under control. The fact my BP and heart rate are directly affected by my anxiety condition makes it a double edged sword. I’ve been on it 2 years now at .5mg twice daily.  Yeah, you’ll feel a little woozy until your body adjusts, but it will go away.	8	January 13, 2020	39
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	This is my second review for Clonazepam. As I stated before, I’ve only used it (for the past 8 years) on an “as needed” basis with favorable results. I do, however believe that this medication is not for everyone! My mother was prescribed this after my dad passed away suddenly and she had a not so favorable experience-brain fog, auditory hallucinations which obviously increased her anxiety. She had similar experiences when she tried Xanax.   It’s a shame that Clonozepam has caused some individuals nightmarish results!! Clearly people react differently with this either taking it and/or weaning off of it. As others reviewers have stated, some have little or no problems with weaning and others are thrown into a tail spin that put them in the hospital. You really don’t know how your body will respond to it. My heart goes out to the people who are still struggling with the aftermath of this medication!	8	January 13, 2020	25
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	"This has been a life saver for me. I went down a spiral of depression and self destructive behaviour and was very resistant to see a doctor which made things worse. Also, I was scared of the ""fame"" that follows this substance. Once I decided to see a doctor and started the recommended dose - 0.5mg three times a day - life changed in a very acute way: intrusive thoughts were diminished, concentration went up and productivity went back to what it was before depression set in. It's been 4 years on it at the same dosage. This and the anti-depressant saved my life, once I was on the verge of suicide.  Nowadays I allow myself to skip dosages on a few days without any signs of malaise.  I can't say my experience is a textbook example of what it does, but in my personal experience I may say it was fundamental to avoid something worse.  In my country the recommended treatment limit is about 12 weeks; I'm well past that and, as I mentioned, I'm able to take drug holidays without negative effects."	9	January 4, 2020	46
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	Have been on .5 , .25 and now  .17 once daily.  Began med 20 months ago.  Had almost tapered off after one year all way down to .125, had a traumatic accident and panic attacks began.  Back up to .5 for 4 months.   This third time on this med.  First was 9 years!  Taper took 3 months first time,  no withdrawal.  Second time was 6 years later for only 1 month, no problem getting off.  This time has been harder.  But going slow and taking control of my taper is do-able.  I’m down to .17 for 5 days now.  Had one poor sleep on 4th night, 5th night was better and days are ok.  I take gabapentin 600 mgs daily (two doses at 300 mgs each, am one and pm one).  It calms me and has made this much easier.  The reason I started tapering with gaba is I was having breakthrough panic attacks,  did not  want to increase dose.  Instead of going up, I went down.  Go slow!!!!!  Stick with it.  Ask about gabapentin to help.  This med stopped panic, but I will never choose it again.	6	January 4, 2020	9
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	"Wish there were negative numbers to rate clonazepam. HORRIBLE stuff. Have been having anxiety and panic attacks over real situations (not just imagined). Took it once and felt like all the life had drained out of the world, not to mention staggering across the room. Cut dosage for second pill in half and felt nothing. Next morning I woke up and felt the worst depression and brain fog I have experienced in my whole life. PLUS extreme anxiety over feeling this way! It CREATES anxiety, plus depression, brain fog and lack of coordination. I'd rather have a ""normal"" panic attack and anxiety. This stuff is HORRIFIC. AVOID AT ALL COSTS. (To top it all off, people get addicted to it and can't come off it? What kind of bad joke is this stuff? Who paid off the FDA to approve it?!!)"	1	December 31, 2019	26
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	Tried other medicines but  clonazepam works the best, I take it as needed 0.5mg along with clonidine 0.2mg	10	December 29, 2019	20
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	I’ve been on clonazepam since I was 27 yrs old and I am now 51. I have complex PTSD, diagnosed at age 21. Age 27 I was put on medication. First I was on Zoloft, it gave me worse anxiety and I developed anorexia. Then Paxil I was really anxious and it scared me. I ended up in the hospital for 11 days,( I now know I had serotonin syndrome). I went to the hospital again and the emergency department told me to get off these medications and I was put on klonopin and when they ran out, I couldn’t sleep and was extremely anxious and fearful.  I was prescribed 0.5 milligrams twice a day. My Dr now won’t prescribe anymore so I had to go off. I’ve been weaning off since September 2018. It has been hard but overall easy (staying mentally focused is key). I’m now on .25 mg hoping to be off by 2020. This medication saved my life and Helped me get stronger emotionally and psychologically. I honestly  wouldn’t recommend any medication for anyone who has PTSD ..therapy is best.	10	December 17, 2019	32
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	My clonazepam brand is complete garbage. I doubt that there’s a half milligram in a 2 mg pill. They don’t work, and actually cause more anxiety put you into withdrawal, cause massive nausea and headaches and more side effects then I can mention. Making this product in India with poor quality, them shredding documents and you guys selling batches that don’t meet quality standards so you don’t lose profits at the cost of people’s health is disgusting. Even though the FDA is useless from your big money lobbyists I am filing a complaint along with others that had to experience this horrendous fake medication. Everyone that works for this company belong in prison.		December 13, 2019	36
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	I’ve been on Klonopin for almost 25 years. I’ve been mostly .5 mg 3x per day but I usually only take it twice. Klonopin is an excellent medicine for panic and anxiety, which is what I use it for. It takes the edge off. Keep in mind though most medicines  have a trade off. For me, Klonopin has been a miracle drug but it does take the edge off everything. Creativity went way down, attention span, sex drive. Memory. Everything. Went off it cold turkey many years ago and it tore me up with withdrawal symptoms.	8	December 12, 2019	29
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	I've been taking 1mg Clonazepam 3x a day for many years, for MS and anxiety. One week ago I switch to the generic blue pill with the C 1 on it by Accord. It literally has little potency. I immediately made a complaint. Folks, if you have a complaint, nothing will be done unless you call your local FDA office!	1	December 9, 2019	18
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	Been on 1mg up to 3 times a day as needed for anxiety for the last 3 years. changed my life greatly. Before taking this I would not make eye contact with people was always worried about little things and had ruminating and intrusive thoughts. I was also initially prescribed this for sleep but it does not really make me tired even at the max dose. but great for anxiety and panic disorders	10	November 25, 2019	50
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	PROBLEM is that the new TEVA without the scoreline has been released and DOES NOT work the same as the old version WITH the scoreline its just addicting. it does nothing else. it has caused me to be very sick... teva please, bring back the old formula.	1	November 23, 2019	18
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	OMG. I was prescribed Klonopin 2mgs three times a day for almost 15 YEARS. I wanted to get off in 2019 so asked Dr to begin tapering down. In 9/2019 I was @ 1 milligram a day - went cold turkey. HOLY MOLY!!  Welcome to the worst time in my life for almost an entire month! In bed entire time - Shaking/Sweating/Convulsing/Etc... Thought I would surely be the end of me one particular day when blood pressure went to the stratosphere and pulse was 180 ALL DAY! Think about your heart beating almost 200 beats per minute from 4AM to 11PM. Was going to call 911 but was so delirious couldn't! This is hands down NOT a drug to take for a long period of time YET not one Dr ever said a word to me!	1	November 20, 2019	29
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	I took clonazepam one an hour ago so hoping it'll knock me out. I can't even sleep now. So I guess they're not for me.	4	November 10, 2019	13
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	This medication has worked WONDERS for me. I have extremely bad anxiety and had no relief for months on end. Was convinced I was going crazy and in a frantic state of mind constantly. Not sleeping well, not eating well, panicking, overwhelming and intrusive thoughts at a high. As soon as I got over my fear of taking medication and actually swallowed my first dose I found the next morning to feel a huge sense of relief from the anxiety. I was not as paranoid and socially anxious, which I’ve never experienced even on good days. The benefits of this medication are incredible.    I will say that becoming addicted to this seems to be a very reasonable statement. I don’t know how long I’ll be on it but my tolerance has quickly risen and I’m taking more and more for the same relief. It’ll be a month on it now but this is the ONLY thing that has worked for me. For desperate situations like my own this medication is a lifesaver.	10	November 7, 2019	47
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	I frequently experiences those patterns of thought and emotion that psychiatrists call social anxiety, generalized anxiety and depression. Got prescribed clonazepam a few years ago when my anxiety was through the roof. I take 1/2 to 1 tablet of the lowest dose on days when I'm so anxious I feel like vomiting or when I'm trapped in a social situation I can't escape and have a sobbing breakdown that I just can't get under control. In most cases, within a half-hour or so of taking the pill my nausea eases off and/or I can finally stop crying and stay dry-eyed for several hours straight. The only side effect I've noticed is moderate physical tiredness that lasts several hours.	5	November 1, 2019	12
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	After a rough spot as we all have in life I saw a psychiatrist. He prescribed me 2mgs clonazepam daily. It was one in the morning and two at night. I can’t take at work as I work in surgery. So I took them at night and feel the effects mildly all the next day. I’ve always had insomnia and it has helped with both anxiety and sleep but now I am trapped and it is so difficult to get off.  My doctor never even as much mentioned this   Good luck to all of you when and if you decide to get off this stuff because you will always need more as tolerance is constantly an issue.  This drug is great short term not long term.  Doctors are mostly clueless as to what exactly a person suffers getting off these and other meds.  	4	October 30, 2019	21
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	I seem to be one of the few people that does not get any benefit from clonazepam. I have treatment resistant OCD, depression, anxiety, and panic disorder. I thought I'd try this med to deal with the constant anxiety OCD causes me. I figured I'd take it just once or twice a week to avoid dependence. I tried 0.5mg which did virtually nothing, so the next time I tried 1mg which maybe helped the tiniest bit for a few hours, but it made me exhausted and I fell asleep sitting up. Also with both doses, after those first few hours, my OCD got WORSE for several days, which made my depression worse too. This is the 9th med I've failed, not sure what's next. Ps. All benzos contain lactose, keep in mind if you are intolerant.	2	October 29, 2019	6
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	Once my doctor prescribed this medication clonazepam  with .25 mg and I felt relieved. Then I thought of increasing to get its full benefits (.25 to .50 then .50 to 1mg then 1mg x2 and finally 1mg x3).  The more I increased the more I felt relaxed, focused and smart. So, I was on 3mg per day. Finally, when I ended up with 3mg I started having the side effects like sleepiness (more like sedation), forgetfulness, decreased sexual urge, confusion, increased depression etc. I tried a lot to quit from it and my anxiety comeback more severely and had a fainting sensation. I had to be admitted in hospital to withdraw fully from it. Now, I am fully withdrawn from it but my anxiety in has increased than usual with disorganised thinking and speaking, slight forgetfulness.  This is an occasional or short term drug which is given during the initial period of any drugs. Using this for long term period creates high dependency for this drug and you will no longer be the same person with it!		October 26, 2019	14
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	I have suffered with anxiety, depression, and panic disorder my whole life. I was prescribed this clonazepam med a few years ago and am now taking about 3mg a day and it’s a lifesaver. I’m a night shift nurse for a few more months so it not only helps my anxiety but also my circadian rhythm problems. Scared to go off if I become pregnant though (I’m a 25 year old woman and heard withdrawals are pretty bad)	10	October 25, 2019	17
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	I have been taking Clonazepam 0.5mg for about 10 years now. When my initial anxiety emerged my doctor put me on Paxil. With Paxil I was not myself and the side effects were horrible. Just this month I had to take mental health leave from work due to being overwhelmed, never had to do this before. Doctor tried putting me on Cymbalta and the side effects trying to get I. This drug were horrific, like a nightmare. I don’t know why doctors don’t listen. Clonazepam work 100% for me. They talk about addictive ness of Clonazepam, but they never talk about the horrific side effects of anti depressants going on and coming off those meds. I use to have panic attacks and anxiety even when on anti depressants, but once I was prescribed Clonazepam have not had a panic attack in 8 years.	10	October 24, 2019	52
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	Doctors have made me try every SNRI, SSRI out there. My symptoms worsen. I have been hospitalized with serotonin syndrome taking these medications. A doctor did not look over my current drugs and prescribed me amitriptyline for foot neuropathy. Within two weeks I was in the ER. They gave me more clonazepam with ativan  and fixed me right up. Much of my anxiety stems from being disabled by two back surgeries and spinal stenosis. This medicine saved my life. I was given valium before clonazapam.	10	October 20, 2019	28
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	I have suffered for most of my life with bad anxiety and panic attacks. I believe it is the cause of my high blood pressure. I have been on this for almost two years. I am prescribed to take 1 mg 3 times a day but only take 1 and half a day.... I am going to slowly try and get off of these. I don’t notice any side effects.  I do believe I am addicted to them.  I take them daily.  I want to start taking only when I need them. But after suffering for so many years with chronic anxiety and panic attacks. I take everyday.  I never want to feel anxiety or have another panic attack again on my life.  But I don’t want to be on a pill everyday either. This pill has saved my life, but it’s time to cut back and start feeling things I don’t want to feel again.  I’m praying I won’t feel the anxiety anymore? But I know I will. I hate anxiety and I feel so bad for everyone that suffers from it!	7	October 19, 2019	32
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	I have been taking Klonopin for approximately 7 years now but only on an “as needed” basis. I only take 1 (0.5mg) when I feel like I truly need it and sometimes I just cut in half. This drug is great for that purpose alone. I would never want to take it daily and end up with dependency. This is just my opinion and personal experience with it. I always keep it on hand for peace of mind and my Dr (knowing I don’t abuse it) still prescribes it for me. My heart goes out to people who have been taking it daily for years and then try to wean off only to find themselves in a nightmare of withdrawals!!	8	October 17, 2019	27
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	It is hands down the best! I wish I could take it everyday but its very addicting, 3 weeks is all that is  could take mentally to be hooked. It makes me feel happy, focused, no depression, think better do everything better!!	10	October 9, 2019	30
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	I was on a low dose of Ativan for anxiety,  panic attacks and PTSD symptoms, for over a decade. After so many years it didn't work as well. Instead of raising the dosage my pdoc reccomended I give clonazepam a try. I was hesitant,  I dislike change. But I'm glad I gave in and tried it, it stays in my system much much longer than the Ativan and I don't even need a high dosage. I take 0.5 x 2 daily as needed. It will be a year next month and in this past year I've had no panic attack's at all. Amazing!  The side effects I've had were sleepiness and weight loss.  I went from 160lbs to 130lbs in the first 6 months.  Without changing anything. I do still get a little tired on it, but nothing too bad.  If your thinking of trying an anxiety med, I recommend giving this one a try.	10	October 9, 2019	32
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	I've been  taking clonazepam for the last 8 years and it is very effective for anxiety. I was unable to walk  and go places and feeling scary to stand and walk due to anxiety. I am taking this medicine and enjoying my work and life.	9	October 8, 2019	40
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	Ok so here’s the thing. This medication was recommended to me after I told my doctor that I no longer wanted to use Xanax given it’s newly acquired bad reputation. I’m on 0.5 (an immensely small dose) and it’s helped tremendously. Lost multiple friends and family members this year and my stress levels have been through the roof. On such a small dose both my mother (a licensed practitioner) and my doctor are not worried about it forming some sort of full blown addiction. As needed is the way to be. Don’t take them “once a day as needed” take them as YOU need them not every day. Don’t worry about the side effects. Don’t worry about the stigma. Just heal. And if this happens to be an aid in healing for the time being well, then so be it	10	October 3, 2019	101
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	I have a chronic illness as well as Fibromyalgia and generalized anxiety. I've had insomnia for decades, and Clonazepam, 1.5 mg taken nightly helps me tremendously. I've been taking this drug since 2006 and have always taken it as prescribed. I'm 55 years old.  I recently had a physician tell me I must stop this drug because of dependence. So I don't know what to do. It's the only thing that helps me have a good night's sleep.	10	September 19, 2019	29
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	From the time I was little I had  restless leg syndrome (RLS). I never took anything for it. I would go outside in the winter & stand in the freezing snow in my bare feet, & believe it or not it worked for a lil while. In 1997 my Dad passed, & I totally lost it. My doctor put me on clonazepam for  anxiety  and depression. It worked great. After some time of being on it, I noticed my RLS was gone. Amazing! Now they want me to slowly get off of it. My restless leg syndrome is back, and I don’t sleep well at all. My  anxiety is getting worse again, & the withdrawal is horrible. I would stay on it for the rest of my life if they would let me, but because I have to take pain killers I can’t be on both. They want me to take medical Marijuana instead. I hate the thought of that. An I really hate the thought of going through withdrawal. I’m done for either way I go. Up the creek without a paddle.	10	September 19, 2019	18
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	I take clonazepam .05 mg and it helps a lot for me. I have a mild essential tremor. I take the pill only as needed. It stops my tremors and calms me down. It also helps on my anxiety attack. It’s not addictive for me but I bring it in my pouch every day just in case of emergency.	10	September 18, 2019	23
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	I have been taking clonazepam 1mg for years. Mine was either yellow or white. Now it was changed to a blue color with c 1 on back. Seems to me the blue ones don't take effect as fast. seems like it takes about an hour while the other ones only took 15 to 25 minutes. Don't know why	10	September 17, 2019	16
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	I have been on Klonopin for almost 3 years and it is the worst drug you could ever be on, in my experience. It is highly addictive and you become very dependent on it. It caused my depression to become worse that I have been hospitalized several times for it. And coming off the drug is terrible if you suddenly stop taking it. I get insomnia, worsening of depression, confusion, and muscular pain. You have to slowly taper off of it. I do NOT recommend this drug to anyone with anxiety or depression.	1	September 14, 2019	18
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	I've taken 1mg daily for anxiety and panic attacks for over 20 years. I've never experienced any side effects from Clonazepam. I've tried to stop, and have been successful, but the anxiety and panic attacks return. I live a much better quality of life with it, and I accept that.	9	September 10, 2019	72
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	Clonazepam save my life. Two years ago suddenly I was very sensitive to sound. Fear, anxiety, high stress completely ruin my life. I thought I was going to mad. Then doctor prescribed me 0.5mg clonazepam once daily. After using 2 years continuously I observe that it decreases my memory power and it is very very addicting medicine. Then I follow Ashton method to reduce it. 10 months ago I started to reduce it. Few days ago I completely off clonazepam. Withdrawal effect was not very strong because of slowly reduction and I was also convert the clonazepam to Daily exercise, eat a lot of fruits and vegetables. Clonazepam is a miracle drug but before taking this medicine you should know how to use it.	8	September 9, 2019	23
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	clonazepam medication works wonders for my anxiety	10	September 8, 2019	21
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	I’m on Zoloft 50 mg and .5 klonopin to ease the side effects of Zoloft. Take this temporarily because it’s highly addictive.	10	August 31, 2019	4
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	I've been taking 0.5 mg of Clonazepam for about a week, it has helped tremendously with panic attacks, I still feel anxiety but its less bad as it once was. I take 0.5 mg in the morning when I wake up to prevent a panic attack and 0.5mg at night to help me sleep. The only thing is it makes me so weak, shaky, I have no appetite and it makes me way too drowsy to drive and I really need to fix that because I have a road test for my license to do that I won't be able to take my Clonazepam to help my panic attack because I can't drive. Seeing a psychiatrist soon I hope everything works out. The drowsiness is killer. My whole body wants to sleep but my mind is trying to keep pushing forward.	5	August 31, 2019	6
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	I started having serious anxiety attacks daily that included upset stomach, nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite and an elevated heart rate. After doing some blood work which came back normal, my doctor has prescribed 0.5mg of clonazapam as well as an anti-depressant, Zoloft. The Clonazepam is intended to be taken daily to manage the attacks until the anti-depressant starts to take effect in a few weeks. The clonazapem has been managing the attacks and I don’t need a lot. I am surprised though how many people out there have been taking this medication long term - some for decades. Everything I’ve read, and what my doctor confirmed, is that benzos are not intended to be used long term. A lot of people who use benzos long term are addicted without realizing it, and there are a lot of doctors out there that are pill-pushers. Thankfully mine is not and I am hopeful I will be able to manage my anxiety the healthiest way possible, and using medications as they are intended to be used.	9	August 24, 2019	13
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	Was on klonopin (anxeity) for 3 years til I started needing to increased amount or I would have a panic attacks, I couldn't sleep, couldn't drive, felt like my bones was going to pop and   had 3 seizures. Later I had to quit my job.  I hate this medicine with a passion and do not recommend it. It had me having horrible thoughts.  I went to see another dr and he prescribed me lexapro.  With that medicine I'm back feeling happy no anxiety or panic attacks. I can drive like I use to and talk to everyone with no anxiety . I hope this helps anyone who is going through what I went through.	1	August 15, 2019	13
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	Eventually you’ll have to titrate your dose up because the drug becomes less and less effective over long durations and you develop tolerance to it	8	August 10, 2019	8
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	This medication saved my life. I take it once a week, or whenever I'm having an unbearable anxiety attack, where I'm nauseous and shaking. It isn't meant to be used every day. It's habit-forming and you'll develop a tolerance, so I only take it when I really, really need it. Having it is just a comfort. It's like a safety net. Knowing that if the panic attack comes, I can stop the horrible effects and the pacing and the vomiting and shaking. A downside is that you'll develop a tolerance if you use it more than once or twice a week, so you do have to be extremely careful. It stops my panic attacks and it's saved my life. It's kept me from killing myself because I thought I'd never be able to escape the anxiety. I'd only recommend it if you've tried SSRIs and they haven't helped, and your anxiety is unbearably severe.	9	August 4, 2019	18
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	So I used to take Xanax 1mg 3 times a day it helped but made me tired now my doc put me on 1mg 3 times a day of klonopin. Day 3 I feel nothing  I tried 1.5 and felt very calm and relaxed. 		August 3, 2019	7
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	I only take this drug  clonazepam 0.5 mg tablet if needed, my psychiatrist gives me 15 tablets per month and that's just fine. I only use this drug sparingly. It's not meant to be used every day.	10	July 30, 2019	12
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	I’ve been taking this medication clonazepam for over 30 years for anxiety and panic disorder. It saved my life. I believe at this time in my life it may cause me to lose my life if I tried to stop. I’m 72 years old. I’m changing to a new Dr. and so hoping he won’t try to take me off clonazepam.	10	July 26, 2019	38
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	Clonazepam or Klonopin is an excellent anti anxiety medication. Probably the best I've tried for myself. It's important to work with your doctor and let him in the loop, especially if you try to get off of this medication. You must respect this medication and take as your doctor has prescribed only.

Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	This orange, minty, candy-like clonazepam pill is the worst thing that has ever happened to me in my life. And I'm not alone. It's a quick and easy relief during an anxiety/panic attack. Or just general anxiety. But there are severe consequences if taken for a longer period of time and or on a regular basis.  BE CAUTIOUS with this medication. It shouldn't be taken regularly and longer than a couple months at MOST. I strongly hold the belief it should only be taken alongside therapeutic treatment.  I've been on Clonazepam for 2 years. I'm down to .75 now. But the withdrawals are absolutely the worst thing I could describe a human being could experience. The last 2 years have been a weird personality blur, which I haven't been aware of until recently.  Overall for mental health conditions, I'd say seek therapy; not a pill to make you forget about your worries. I would have rather been physically dependent to heroin any day.	1	July 19, 2019	11
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	I have been using Clonazepam for 5 months, 0.25 mg before bed.  It is a really good medicine it helps you sleep better, relaxes your brain.  It gives  me full 8-9 hours of sleep and I wake up pretty refreshed no side effects that I can feel up to now.  I have started to taper off the medicine.  I am taking half of 0.25 mg which is pretty low dose and I guess and it still works for me.  Just be cautious with this medicine it’s addictive so try to taper it slowly 	10	July 17, 2019	16
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	I have been a small dose of Clonazepam for 30 years. This drug has saved my life. I lived in the house for years; was hospitalized multiple times. Along, with a SSRI I have been able to leave my house for short periods of time. I feel if used correctly and not abusing such a drug it should not be withdrawn.	10	July 15, 2019	22
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	This medication has kept me alive when all I’ve wanted to do is let myself go from the extreme amount of panic attacks I was having a day. I take .5mg in the morning and .5mg in the evening along with my SNRI. I would rate this medication a 10 if I wasn’t so fatigued on it all of the time. It does exactly what it’s supposed to do and for right now it would be unbearable for me to get through a day without it. Thank goodness for this medication.	8	July 15, 2019	22
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	I was originally prescribed this for serious panic attacks associated with PTSD and found it to be quite effective (0.5-1.0mg doses) Cant say I've ever noticed it having any effect on sleep but for anxiety and panic disorders it works a charm when other medications, like pregabalin, didn't quite cut it.	8	July 15, 2019	17
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	I have PTSD, Agoraphobia and Social Anxiety. My Psychiatrist put me on this medication  clonazepam along with an antidepressant. Since I have started using it I have been able to go out and socialise along with a large reduction in flashbacks.  It is a great medication for when things get out of hand, I am only on a low dose (0.5mg twice a day) but it is a lot stronger and more helpful than other benzos I have trialled.	10	July 10, 2019	16
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	I have been on 1 mcg of Clonazepam at night time to treat nocturnal panic attacks.  It works like a charm.  I sleep and I never have an attack when I take it.  =)	10	July 10, 2019	12
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	Have taken Clonazapam for several years.. Prescribed for cervical dystonia. Positive: helped control head tremor Negative: memory impairment. I would rather have the tremor! I was not informed that there would be changes in memory and mood. Read the pharmaceutical information before  taking prescriptions!! Talk to the pharmacist!! I did.  Too late !	1	June 24, 2019	6
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	Taking clonazepam for anxiety. More social anxiety than anything else. Have been on this for a decade and started having issues with short term memory while in school again and decided to get off it. Yes the withdrawal is brutal but the medication works for awhile. Noticed it wasn't working like it did at the start when I switched to another drug for my anxiety. 	8	June 15, 2019	13
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	I suffer from major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder and PTSD. My anxiety became extremely out of control, racing thoughts, paranoid a lot and over thinking. I have taken Clonazepam in the past, and learned that  it is a medicine you take about an hour before you go to bed. I would never take this during the day. I normally stay fatigued anyway throughout the day so if it causes that I wouldn't really know. I really do appreciate how this medicine works, how it gave me the best sleep I have had in a long time, and calmed the craziness in my head, I feel like I am getting my life back.	10	June 14, 2019	24
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	Been taking Clonazepam 0.5 mg twice a day as needed for anxiety, some days I only take one. I’m also taking paroxetine 20mg once daily. I love the medication for my social anxiety and I sleep so much better. But I wish I didn’t sleep so much. The other day I slept for 22 hours. Hopefully my body will get used to the medication soon and I won’t feel so tired. But other than sleeping a lot I love the medication. It calms me down and I’m less stressed.	9	May 11, 2019	19
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	I am 34 years old and have been on clonazepam 0.5 twice daily since I was 19. I have never had any side effects and I can truthfully say that it has been an absolute lifesaver for me! I have anxiety disorders, depression and PTSD. I highly recommend it if you have anxiety/panic attacks and it does help me relax and sleep. I've also never had to to increase my dose in all these years while taking them.	10	May 10, 2019	63
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	I went to a.psychiatrist because of sleepless nights and he told me that I was having an anxiety and panic attacks. He prescribed me Xanax 250mcg 2x a day and escitalopram 5mg in between. He also prescribed .25mg of clonazepam (rivotril) before going to.bed but still I can't get enough sleep and the anxiety gets worse.		May 9, 2019	8
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	This medicine helps me with my daily activities sometimes my anxiety is so bad I can’t eat or drink my throat feels closed up and my mind is constantly racing with thoughts. I feel as if I’m out of my body and mind I tried getting off of it cold turkey.  My withdrawals were horrible I had to retake the medication. Hopefully one day I’ll be back to normal without it but for now it REALLY HELPS!! I’m HAPPY AGAIN	9	April 30, 2019	20
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	I had severe attacks of anxiety followed by vertigo for over a year that were not treated in time due to the wrong diagnosis of doctors. To shorten the story after a while, I go to a doctor who recognizes the problem and gives me clonazepam, for which I have been around for almost a year. I am 90 percent better after ten months of therapy and even forget about a couple of days to take the drug. My anxiety caused dizziness and I get this unpleasant feeling and  I get a little scared, but after taking the medicine it quickly passes.	10	April 24, 2019	21
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	I just suffered from two weeks of hell, bad continuous unrelenting panic attacks, sudden spike of simple partial seizures, I was starting to feel hopeless exhausted and ready to give up on life. Words can’t describe what I was going through. Desperately went to a medicentre and broke down in front of the doctor about not being able to see my GP for another week and I couldn’t take it anymore and he instantly prescribed the Clonazepam. Within 1 hour I felt normal again and I almost cried tears of joy, and the normal feeling keeps getting better and better. I hope I don’t become dependant though	10	April 5, 2019	32
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	My doctor has tried me on many different drugs from gabapenten, seroquil, Xanax, Valium, propranolol, klonadine..nothing works for me except Klonopin. Because of all the studies coming out and many people having adverse reactions to the drug; I am now reduced to taking Advil at 800mg each night and klonadine. I never had withdrawals, gaps in memory, walking around in a zombie state..when I was taking this medicine regularly I even skipped doses. Anyways, I’m not the doctor..and am still be treated like a lab rat for trial and error medications. Sucks	10	April 3, 2019	13
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	I've taken clonazepam for over twenty years with no side effects,  I tried to stop a few times, but the anxiety and mood swings caused me to start again. I just hate the feeling of being so reliant upon it.	8	March 25, 2019	41
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	I have been taking 0.5 for about 10 years. It helps me sleep much better where before I would wake up with a mind that wouldn't stop. I was on Ambien and that was too much. Happy with my Drs. recommendation as my dosage is pretty low.		March 25, 2019	15
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	I suffer from GAD which manifests itself by causing PAINFUL knots in my upper back muscles at its worse. I tried aspirin, ibuprofen, and prescription muscle relaxers. Nothing eased the pain except 1.5-2 mg of Clonazepam. After years of taking Clonazepam skipping a day or two here and there, I was curious to see if I would experience withdrawal. Thus, recently I refrained from taking any for 5 days. Thankfully, nothing triggered my anxiety during those 5 days and I also take Lexapro daily (still prone to the trigger point knots in my back even on lexapro if my anxiety is triggered). I didn’t experience any withdrawal symptoms. I guess I am one of the lucky ones after reading about the horrors of Clonazepam withdrawals.	10	February 7, 2019	19
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	Long story short,  I was a police officer for 16yrs. I had the extreme misfortune of having to use deadly force on a horribly confused, and drug enraged 19 yr old kid. Every time I closed my eyes in an effort to sleep,  I would re-live the incident as vividly as it was in real life, seeing the young man's face and the confusion in his eyes. I reclused from my wife and children, as well as everyone else. I believed I was too strong to need counselling or medication to help me.  After finally realizing I was on the verge of destroying those that I love beyond what words can express, I went to my family Dr, who told me he had been waiting for me to come for help.  I was put on Lexapro daily,  and 0.5 Clonazepam as needed. It saved me from going insane, I truly believe.  It doesn't change the horror of having to do what I did,  but does calm my mind so I can get some rest and be a husband and daddy to my angel of a wife and two precious  boys..	8	January 27, 2019	61
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	I have been on 2mg clonazepam for more than 5 years. It has done wonders for my anxiety and panic attacks. When I informed the Dr. I was concerned about addiction he advised me I am DEPENDANT on it, not ADDICTED. Addiction is the misuse of a drug he said, big difference! I am allowed 2mg up to 3 times a day but very rarely take more than 2. It has literally changed my life.	9	January 22, 2019	50
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	The drug is great, calms you, lets you sleep with anxiety and major family illnesses.  However do not use on a daily basis after 30 days.  I was not informed by my general practitioners (2) to be exact how addictive this med is.  Now I am going thru tapering (a nice word for withdrawal) after 8 years.  It is worst feeling in the world.  Now trying to get into Med Detox.  Be very careful with Benzos.  In fact only take when you are dying.  It will calm your death anxiety.	1	January 15, 2019	19
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	If you’re  considering taking clonazepam, this should be a temporary prescription only! I was prescribed this for severe anxiety. What no one will tell you is that this medication is severely addictive to your system . No matter how strong or how healthy you are, you can die from trying to stop the medicine cold turkey. I almost died twice. Whatever anxiety you are feeling now, it will be amplified by 100x’s when it comes to trying to stop the medication; it anchors into your body.  I was told that  Clonazepam  is harder to get off of  than Heroin. Just consider that when your doctor tries to prescribe it to you for more than a few weeks. Even then, it should be taken as needed and it should be taken in small doses.  And just to be clear, I almost died twice because I was trying to stop taking the medication not because I took too much of it. Hope this helps at least one person’s life	1	January 14, 2019	27
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	Wonderful medication I  have been on 0.5 mg for many years now and sometimes take another 0.5 at  night to help me relax and sleep. I do not drink so that's not an issue. I have a sharp memory so no problems there. I have a stressful life and this really helps me to calm and focus myself. I am less shy and can express myself better at work when I take 0.5 which I do everyday. It has helped me so much with my shyness and anxious self I only wish I had sought out help earlier in my life.  I am in my late 50's and have taken this for over 10 years. Frankly my cognition and memory are better than others my age. Recommend if constant worry and shyness are holding you back. Just keep dosage steady and don't increase if you don't need to. I do not have an addictive personality so for me this medication is great!	10	January 5, 2019	50
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	I was stable on diazepam and was prescribed it off and on for 30 years. I had tried all the SRIs and Selective SRI's with only worsening conditions. I tried them all, some more than once. Finally it dawned on my new GP that I has serotonin syndrome with the SRIs, After 4 months of trying other things, nothing worked. My new pain doctor tried me on clonazepam. The first dose worked wonders. My constantly struggling with anxiety all day was gone. No more waking up with immediate panic attacks either. I am a different man. There is no high with a drug if your body needs it. Same with opioids. Benzos and opioids can safely be used together if you cannot tolerate SRIs due to serotonin syndrome.	10	December 14, 2018	27
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	This product helps reduce anxiety symptoms. Within 45 minutes or less. It can make you tired and glassy eyed. So be careful taking this medicine. I really like this medicine because I can go into public places again without anxiety.	9	December 8, 2018	18
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	Klonopin helps with panic and anxiety you get before going out in public. It also made me calm without making me feel drugged up or high which allowed me to partake in daily life activities.	8	December 3, 2018	15
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	Was on clonazepam for 10 years after trying other antidepressants with no relief, had reactions to the antidepressants. Had to find a new Dr due to mine retiring. Have been off the clonazepam for 4 mths and have tried 6 different medications. None have worked for my anxiety and panic attacks. They have continued to get worse than ever before! I have to be on opioids due to many medical conditions and have thyroid problems and autoimmune disorders. Which only make the anxiety worse. Followed all the rules and never abused the clonazepam lowered my dose myself with no problem! Trying to find a new Dr who will prescribe clonazepam is impossible. Just because you have to take opioids too! You are put in the category of an abuser. Which I am not. I just know what work's for me and what does not. Really tired of these Drs not treating there patients because they are more afraid of the black box laws.	10	December 1, 2018	40
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	Severe anxiety in 8 yr old. Was prescribed .5mg of clonazepam to be taken at .25 2X per day. Plan was to follow a week of this with 5mg of prozac and increase to 10mg. Clonazepam was to provide immediate relief. After two days my son become beligerant and angry. We stopped the drug and moved immediately to prozac which takes up to 4 weeks to provide relief. Doctor advised us to try with the CZP again over a long weekend. Results were no relief for anxiety and a renewal of beligerance including hitting and kicking parents and severe anger.	1	November 28, 2018	2
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	I have been taking clonazepam for over 10 years. I take a 1 mg tablet 3 times a day. It helps me tremendously! I used to have bad panic attacks and I would get so stressed out sometimes that I actually would cut myself to calm down. I started out on a lower dosage and eventually ended up where I am now. At first it caused drowsiness, but not now. As long as I take the correct dosage 3 times per day, I am perfect! If I forget a dose, it doesn't take long before I notice it and my family does too. I have never tried getting off of the clonazepam since I started it. If I tried, I would probably get help from my doctor and taper very slowly. It works and helps me, so I see no need in stopping taking it.	10	November 26, 2018	30
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	I take clonazepam for depression along with bupropion and it helped me a lot with my mood. I stopped having crisis and crying like I did before when I took only bupropion without clonazepam.		November 15, 2018	14
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	My dr put me on this 0.5mg  klonipin  when required in 2010. I at first felt confused so I decided to cut pill in half taking 0.25mg as needed.  My new dr  tried to change it to buspar  because of regulations.  It did not work for  my anxiety I need to take it feel relief within an hr in situations.  I  was on Ativan in the 80's for a short time. I had to convince my new dr  to try it give me 10 pills and see how I do     that was 2 wks ago and I have had to take 1/4 or 1/2 pill and settle down in 30-40 min I am 65 use to be a registered nurse  wish I had this years ago	10	November 9, 2018	10
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	This is excellent every day use for anxiety. My life has been so much better the past 3 years that  I've been taking clonazepam. Quality of life, relationships, work, social. I plan to take them the rest of my life. Able to enjoy life and be productive. Helps most when I am manic with bi polar	10	October 16, 2018	23
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	I get really bad anxiety to a point where my chest get so tight and I can hardly breath and start getting paranoid. Clonazepam has worked so great !!	10	October 2, 2018	24
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	The first time I took Clonazepam was in 2006 & it was for an appointment. I had eaten before I took it & it didn't work. Because of this I didn't want to take again (I didn't realize that eating may prevent it from working). In 2015 I was prescribed it again at the ER (because of anxiety). I decided to fill the prescription & I took 0.5 mg. Since I had not eaten for several hours it worked (after 2 hours) & I didn't feel anxious. I like it more than Ativan, since it has been more effective in reducing my anxiety for various medical appointments & even social situations -  I once lost my keys & had to have a security guard help me find them; this security guard is rude & if I had not taken the pills I would have left the mall & just paid to have them all replaced instead of asking for this security guard's help. The only thing I don't like about Clonazepam is it causes me to gain weight and worsens my acne, even though I don't eat or drink anything different when I take it.	7	August 7, 2018	11
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	This medicine changed my life, seriously. I have anxiety/panic attacks and I take 0.25mg when I’m feeling anxious and cannot function, and I’ve been on this dose for 2 years. It works within 30 min and lasts the rest of the day so I can do whatever I need to do. I don’t take it every day, sometimes I’ll take it for a week straight if I have something stressful going on and then I’ll go weeks without taking it at all. I haven’t had any withdrawal symptoms so I think it’s a great medicine if you have anxiety. I’m not sure I wouldn’t recommend taking this daily because I could definitely see it becoming less effective!	10	August 3, 2018	24
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	I have been taking this medication for like 4 years now or close 0.5 mg once a day. I took it in the past and stopped when I got pregnant no withdrawals. I tried to taper off recently and I had bad racing thoughts with anxiety and panic attacks so  I got back on them. I’m going to let my psychiatrist tell me when to wean off and do what’s best for me to wean off one day, until then I’m taking them as needed if or when I do have a panic or anxiety attack.	10	July 28, 2018	11
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	Started taking 0.5 milligram of clonazepam up to three times per day due to my PTSD disorder. Never had to take more than one pill per day so doctor refilled my prescription advising only one tablet per day. Works great for me but beneficial effects wane if you take it everyday. It is best to wait until you actually feel a panic attack coming on and then take it, not if you just assume a certain situation will cause anxiety before hand. No drug is perfect but it keeps me balanced enough to at least think and react rationally in day to day activities. I have been on this drug for three months and also take Lexapro 20 mg every night for about five years with good results.	10	July 15, 2018	11
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	I'm very new with this drug, It was prescribed to me by my physician. I'm really needing to know will I be able to function@work? Or is it a drug that needs to be taken@home?		July 12, 2018	3
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	Was given clonazepam 0.5mg three times a day for my anxiety, at first it did help but after two months anxiety came back worse, so doc upped it too 1mg three times a day. It did get rid of the anxiety but all I wanted too do was sleep. So doc tried to find the right dose but in the end it made me worse than I was before I started. After 3 months jumped off it and I actually feel better off it than when I was taking it. What works for some doesn't work for others	4	June 30, 2018	7
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	Worked for a short time. Effective dosage increased rapidly, efficacy decreases at a similar rate. After 2 months side effects became debilitating. Withdrawal symptoms (ongoing) include emotional instability, cognitive and memory impairment.	1	June 25, 2018	8
Acclean	Gingivitis	After hygienist cleaned all four quadrants he stated that I must use a mouthwash RX grade called Acclean for 2 weeks after brushing my teeth to rinse and then spit out. I did as he requested and it stained my teeth brownish  very badly especially the bottom half of the tooth closer to the gums. Tried everything to clean them to no avail. Went back to the hygienist he did a cleaning but stains still remain in the back teeth especially and some of the teeth have spotting. The top portion of each tooth seems to have turned slightly transparent as compared to the bottom half of the tooth which is darker and not transparent. NOT A HAPPY CAMPER!!!	1	December 23, 2017	32
Acclean 60 Second Fluoride Treatment	Prevention of Dental Caries	I'm a long-term user of Clinpro.  Recently, the tubing has become more difficult to use. I can no longer cope with the challenges it presents.  I've cancelled out of future orders. They made a big mistake.  Goodbye Clinpro.     Grove	1	April 8, 2021	0
Acclean 60 Second Fluoride Treatment	Prevention of Dental Caries	I have been using Fluoridex prescription toothpaste for about 5 years as recommended by my dentist. It works great as I have not had a cavity in those 5 years. I just started using the daily defence rinse as well and it is also a wonderful product. As long as I can go to the dentist and only need cleanings it is worth my while to keep using it. I've had zero side effects, and have had no problems opening the tube	10	January 19, 2021	0
Acclean 60 Second Fluoride Treatment	Prevention of Dental Caries	I have used Prevident 5000 for many years.  This was first prescribed to me by my periodontist. Unfortunately, I have  hereditary perio dental issues (caries & gums).  In order to keep my teeth and gums from becoming progressively worse, I was prescribed and have been using this product in place of any/all toothpaste. I must say, I have not gotten a cavity and my gums are in stable condition. To date, great product!	9	October 28, 2020	1
Acclean 60 Second Fluoride Treatment	Prevention of Dental Caries	I'm wondering if it can cause hair loss after using for about 8 months 2x a day?	8	October 26, 2020	0
Acclean 60 Second Fluoride Treatment	Prevention of Dental Caries	I have been using Floridex once a day. It is an OK toothpaste, but seems to leave a film on my teeth which I can taste throughout the day. It also causes my gums to burn slightly. I don’t think I will continue to use.	6	August 1, 2020	2
Acclean 60 Second Fluoride Treatment	Prevention of Dental Caries	I was using Prevident made by Colgate.  It tasted great. I think it is spearmint flavor. My teeth felt clean. That one comes in a small squeeze 3.4 oz bottle , a little less than double this SF 5000 Plus which is 1.8 oz.  Prevident is 3x the price with my Rx plan so I tried this one.  It's very dull.  No flavor. I don't feel my mouth feels fresh. I had to mix it with regular toothpaste in the Prevident bottle. The pharmacy can only get me this or the Prevident.  I'm getting a refill of this SF 5000 Plus. This time I will squeeze it into the bottle and add a drop or two of peppermint oil. That should help the flavor and give me a fresh taste. If you have to use this one and have the same experience that is has no taste, find a small container or something you can dip your toothbrush in and put a drop or two of some kind of flavoring to freshen it up  The company needs to spruce up this stuff. It's bland. I couldn't find how to contact them.	5	May 11, 2020	3
Acclean 60 Second Fluoride Treatment	Prevention of Dental Caries	Makes your mouth very dry and tastes TERRIBLE. I had to use this for 14 days and all I wanted to do was skip it. I dreaded using this every day.	1	August 22, 2019	7
Acclean 60 Second Fluoride Treatment	Prevention of Dental Caries	I was given periogel by my dentist to prevent the return of my gum disease. I was thrilled that there was a product that would help keep it from coming back. I immediately started using the periogel everyday for 15 minutes. The day after I started using it I got very sick and thought I had food poisoning from a salad bar where I had eaten lunch. I continued feeling sick with stomach pain and diarrhea for over a month and I thought that I had lingering problems from food poisoning. I made an appt. with my doctor and decided to go off the gel to see what would happen. The next day I felt much better and 3 days later was completely back to normal. Needless to say I am upset that I was not told about any side effects.	1	June 6, 2019	10
Acclean 60 Second Fluoride Treatment	Prevention of Dental Caries	I was given this (Fluoridex Daily Defense) by my dentist and reluctantly used it starting a couple years ago (early 2017). I was told to use it, spit out the toothpaste, but not rinse. While using this toothpaste, I had some stomach/GI issues occur. I thought it was my diet and I even went to the doctor to investigate, but could not locate any issue. The symptoms showed up gradually, but I would have sharp pains in my lower right abdomen/stomach area, along with bloating. Generally, these would occur in the middle of the night/morning and get better as the day went on, but still persisted.  I had a light bulb moment at the beginning of 2019 wondering if this was causing my persistent issues.  In 2017 (shortly after I started using it) I had muscle issues/tendonitis/sensitivity in both elbows and numbness in my fingers in the night, along with loss of grip strength. Since ceasing utilizing the toothpaste, my tendonitis and other symptoms are basically non-existent.	1	May 4, 2019	10
Acclean 60 Second Fluoride Treatment	Prevention of Dental Caries	Our dentist gave this to my 10 year-old daughter, and she began to use it. A week later, she developed a stomachache. We took her to the doctor, tried a bland diet, probiotics...everything we could. After a month of frustration and tears, it struck me that she'd been using this toothpaste. I did some research, and sure enough, she had all the symptoms of fluoride poisoning. We had her stop using it. It's taken some time, but she's recovered.	1	October 8, 2018	25
Acclean 60 Second Fluoride Treatment	Prevention of Dental Caries	I tried clinpro 5000 given  to me by my dentist,  It helped my teeth but caused me to have all kinds of stomach  problems. Please try hard not to swallow it as bloating and gas occurs immediately.	1	October 5, 2018	18
Acclean 60 Second Fluoride Treatment	Prevention of Dental Caries	"Product seemed okay, but it practically took a pair of pliers to OPEN the blasted top! Called the company and representative mentioned that they were aware of the problem. ""We have contacted the manufacturer of those tops to request that they be improved,"" she stated.   Could I please get a replacement tube? ""No, there is nothing we can do."" Seriously? I have MY own company and I know that there is ALWAYS ""something you can do"" for the customer.  Would never purchase this product again!"	4	August 7, 2018	1
Acclean 60 Second Fluoride Treatment	Prevention of Dental Caries	This prescription strength anti cavity toothpaste may be good at preventing cavities, but opening the cap is nearly impossible. The catch is so strong that it takes a lot of twisting & heavy leverage to get the cap to snap open. We've gone thru 4 tubes now & all of them were the same, so it's not just a temporary manufacturing glitch. It's a poorly designed snap cap.	3	July 2, 2018	6
Acclean 60 Second Fluoride Treatment	Prevention of Dental Caries	"It may be good medicinally, however, the taste is TERRIBLE and caused ""instant dry-mouth"" to me.  Having to formulate the mixture myself before using is NOT ""user friendly"".  The taste alone turned me off completely!!!"	1	May 25, 2018	6
Acclean 60 Second Fluoride Treatment	Prevention of Dental Caries	I was instructed to rinse with the mouth rinse for 14 days before bed to help my gums. After about day 9 I started to wake up with swollen lips and a weird feeling in my mouth. It is day 13 and I think I will not be using it the last day my mouth is sore with patches that feel raw and very uncomfortable.	1	January 4, 2018	10
Acclean 60 Second Fluoride Treatment	Prevention of Dental Caries	I have experienced severe dry mouth after using Pro-denRX aqueous gel for teeth brushing.  I used it for three weeks before I finally realized that my dry mouth started when I began the use of the toothpaste.  I have stopped using Pro-denRX and hope the side effects will eventually disappear.  It has only been two days since I stopped use, so it is too early to tell much.  My mouth is still severely dry.	1	November 2, 2017	10
