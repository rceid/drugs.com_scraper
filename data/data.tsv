Abacavir	HIV Infection	Sorry to say this drug Abacavir definitely had a very bad unpleasant stressful adverse  effect felt in my heart, it was beating harder and surrounding heart area felt a bit off.  After continuing a few doses of Abacavir over a few days I could no longer tolerate or cope with the continuing higher persistent distress of my heart noticeably beating harder around the clock and happily quit taking Abacavir with noticeably rapid overall relief and improvement of no longer noticing any further adverse distressful symptoms with and around my heart.  I definitely feel Abacavir is a very potential danger to the heart!!!!	1	March 21, 2019	2

Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	Triumeq (abacavir / dolutegravir / lamivudine)	I have been HIV positive since 1999. I am 45 years old now. I have been on many regimens over the years. 2015 I switched to Triumeq. 6 years maintaining undetectable virus. Cd4 counts been between 600 and 900.  Joint pain, dizzy spells, high blood pressure, high triglycerides, anxiety, shoulder achyness, recently. Not sure if its because of medicine or bad eating and lack of exercise.	8	April 22, 2021	0
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	Triumeq (abacavir / dolutegravir / lamivudine)	Been positive 34 years, doing fine but decided to change to tthe 1 pill a day instead of 5. This drug may work for some but NOT FOR ME !  have issues with depression and anxiety  and were amplified 100x on this drug. Blood pressure went sky high, headaches, swollen eyes, couldn't eat or sleep. Couldn't function. Went back to original meds, Kaletra and Truvada. Feeling better. They can keep their 1 pill a day!!	1	April 5, 2021	1
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	Triumeq (abacavir / dolutegravir / lamivudine)	I took Triumeq for about a year and I didn't have any side effects for the first six months.  I started getting dizzy spells, felt super emotional for no reason, very sore around my eyes constantly which felt like I had been punched, and the worst was extreme fatigue no matter how long I slept.  I switched to Odefsey and feel much better but I gained a little weight and my hair is thinning and breaking now.	7	February 8, 2021	0
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	Triumeq (abacavir / dolutegravir / lamivudine)	Switched to Triumeq in 2015 after being on Atripla for many years and undetectable. Facial wasting appeared recently.	8	November 8, 2020	2
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	Triumeq (abacavir / dolutegravir / lamivudine)	Great pills! Im useing Tmq from 2017. My CD4 is 1200 and viral load is 0. In the beginning it was 100 000, and after 1 month it was 0. My CD4 was 200 and after 1 year of usein Tmq it was completely recovered, 1200, and it is like that for last 2 years. I have very dry skin and sometime sleeping problems.	10	February 29, 2020	12
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	Triumeq (abacavir / dolutegravir / lamivudine)	Been on Triumeq for a week now and I'm not 100% happy. My last meds stopped working even though I had 100% adherence. Since taking Triumeq I've not slept properly (taking me ages to fall asleep and then waking during the night and taking a long time to go back to sleep) and I'm someone who normally sleeps like a kitten. The other thing I've noticed is really itchy skin: face, neck, torso, legs....no rash, just constant itchy feeling. I've had a couple of dizzy spells one of which made me panic and my heart rate went up to 134 (I was just washing the dishes!). I'll stick with them as one week is too short a time to decide if I can live with the side effects or if they are just temporary. I'll post again in a few weeks.	5	November 19, 2019	12
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	Triumeq (abacavir / dolutegravir / lamivudine)	I started this medication with a VL of 16000 and CD4 451. It didn't cause me any side effects (so far), and after two months I reached undetectable and a CD4 of 668.	10	August 21, 2019	5
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	Triumeq (abacavir / dolutegravir / lamivudine)	I took Triumeq from early 2016 to early 2017. Although it kept my viral load undetectable, I suffered serious side effects: Bizarre dreams, burping and acid reflux, and serious heart diseases. It caused irregular heart beats, and my heart rates went up to 200 beats per minute when I did light exercises (elliptical) which caused blood pressure to drop so low I collapsed. I also experienced blackout for a brief second several times a day, during walking, sitting, and out of nowhere. I also developed a stenosis on my artery, it's fat buildup in my main blood vessel on my neck that caused my blood flow to drop to 40-50% of normal. And if the fat gets detached and goes into my brain, I will have a stroke. Cardiologist said I should not have heart problem because there is no history of heart disease in my family, and I am not overweight, and this problem only started after taking Triumeq. So doctor changed medication to Descovy + Tivicay, and all the aforementioned side effects went away.	2	June 16, 2019	14
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	Triumeq (abacavir / dolutegravir / lamivudine)	I found I am HIV positive by the end of August 2018 and back then had VL over 1 million (really high) and CD4 around 650 (30%) and I started the treatment with Triumeq by the end of October. For the first month I was taking Triumeq before going to bed and I experienced all side effects related with the central nervous system such as insomnia, headache, tiredness, unfocused etc. By the end of November the VL has drooped to 650k and  CD4 went up to 1000 (40%). Despite the side effects that were clearly affecting my daily life both personal and professional because I was all the time tired and sleepy, the doctor and I agreed that I'd give one more month to Triumeq switching it to the mornings. It literally solved all the side effects I haven't experienced any of them since I started taking the pill in the morning. At the beginning of January 2019, around 2/2.5 months after starting the treatment, I'm undetectable and in March I had again CD4 count and was still in good level - 1050 (43%).	10	June 9, 2019	11
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	Triumeq (abacavir / dolutegravir / lamivudine)	Was HIV diagnosed April 1st 2019  My CD4 was at 650 and my viral load was 118.000 after 4 weeks of using Triumeq my viral load is now only 30 :) they didn't re test my CD4 due to it being at 650 :) no side affects either, a little bloated at times but nothing major. I work out 5 times a week and believe this helps a lot. 	10	May 22, 2019	9
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	Triumeq (abacavir / dolutegravir / lamivudine)	I found out that I'm HIV positive on March 2019. Since my CD4 was at 67 Cells, and my VL at 42.000, my Doc started immediately with Triumeq. After a Month, I was undetectable. I don't know, how my CD4 has risen, but I have nearly no side effects. I take it in the morning, and I feel a bit of fatigue, but nothing else. I'm paying 10 Euro per 30 tablets, my insurance covers.	9	April 25, 2019	7
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	Triumeq (abacavir / dolutegravir / lamivudine)	Triumeq is a good treatment,  no side effect except for appendicitis which was a  few months after start taking the tablet.  I got appendicitis  and there have been a few similar cases. Apart from this no other sides effects  first treatment, and year next month ,  undetectable after 2  months start taking	9	March 13, 2019	5
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	Triumeq (abacavir / dolutegravir / lamivudine)	The only problem I have is the cost when I get switched to Medicare Part D. My cost at that time will be $725.00 per month for 30 pills.	10	January 26, 2019	3
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	Triumeq (abacavir / dolutegravir / lamivudine)	I was diagnosed HIV+ in April 2014, it was about a year until my CD4 count dropped to 500, I tried 1 medication for about a month that made me ill, so I was switched to Triumeq, it's a lot better, but not without its side effects, up to 4 hours after taking I have make sure there is a toilet near as it makes me go pretty quick. I also get headaches and tiredness for up to 2 hours after taking then it's like I just push through it. Overall it's good, I can't complain, I mean what's the other option????...lol, I'm glad medicine is moving on so well.  Rich United Kingdom	8	December 4, 2018	9
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	Triumeq (abacavir / dolutegravir / lamivudine)	"November 2016 was my initial HIV+ detection.  I learned that I had a 1 million+ viral load and only 46 T-cells.   Today, I am undetectable.  Undetectable!  It is with some seriously amazing awe that I also read on my latest blood work that my T-cell count is now 402!  My infectious disease doctor told me that I might be experiencing ""IRIS"" (immune reconstitution syndrome) and believes that if I am adherent to the prescription regimen, I may see a 500 t-cell count in the coming year.  Several good people prayed for me; for them I am truly grateful.  I am also taking time to write here because I am convinced that Triumeq saved my life.  I hope my comments can be of help to others."	10	December 2, 2018	24
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	Triumeq (abacavir / dolutegravir / lamivudine)	Diagnosed in July with an unknown infection date.     First test showed a CD4 of 550 and VL of 38000.  Started medication late due to some fights with the insurance company.    Took my first pill on September 7.   Had my follow up blood work drawn on October 3.   I am NOW undetectable! No changes to my CD4 but I know it will increase.    The only side effect  I have noticed in my first month is some minor bloating.   Had some trouble falling asleep for the first week but I assume that was the power of suggestion having read all the possible symptoms.    I know it is early on to review the medication but I am undetectable in less than 30 days.  I just wanted to share!	10	October 11, 2018	12
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	Triumeq (abacavir / dolutegravir / lamivudine)	Started this about 10 months ago and I haven't had any side effects or trouble with sleeping, I am very thankful for this medicine and pray it keeps me happy and healthy forever!	10	October 9, 2018	11
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	Triumeq (abacavir / dolutegravir / lamivudine)	Just started Triumeq with a CD4 count of 271 and a viral load of 104,000. Other than a slight headache, vivid and lucid dreaming (which was awesome)  and vomiting (I took it on an empty stomach.) I haven't had any other side effects. I take it after I eat breakfast in the morning and go on about my day with normal energy levels. Will update when I get my one month labs done to see the progress of this medication.	9	September 30, 2018	10
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	Triumeq (abacavir / dolutegravir / lamivudine)	Started this medication 6 months ago. After the first month I was undetectable! My counts are fantastic. Only issue I’ve had is that I’ve developed some gastrointestinal problems but I’m totally fine with that. I’d much rather be a bit gassy and bloated than no longer have a functioning immune system.	10	September 29, 2018	15
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	Triumeq (abacavir / dolutegravir / lamivudine)	To be honest I was diagnose + in 2004 and didn't actually started meds right away until my health started to fade away little by little after some time with the virus. So when I decided to get on treatment they started me with Kaletra & Combivir for approximately 3 -5 years after that I became resistant to this cocktail and was switch to something else which I can't recall at the moment since I tried a few different ones. Long story short:I started taking triumeq approximately 2 years ago and they really had help me a lot.	8	September 25, 2018	10
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	Triumeq (abacavir / dolutegravir / lamivudine)	I have had HIV since 2008. On my first medicine which was Atripla I could not sleep,  I had headaches and crazy dreams. Dr. prescribed me Triumeq which I have  no side effects from. My only problem now is the cost of Triumeq I will be going on Medicare Part D in January 2019 my cost will be about $700.00 per month. I'll be broke in about four years.		July 22, 2018	9
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	Triumeq (abacavir / dolutegravir / lamivudine)	I was diagnosed with full-blown AIDS 25 years ago I was taking trezaver then atripla 15 years then I got sick last year I was told that I only have a year to live I get boils all over my body about the size of a baseball. Doctor switched me to triumeq I was hesitated to take it I just opened the bottle after a month I've been taking it now for three days, no side effects yet had a few headaches but that's about all. Please pray for me I have a wife and a family	6	June 26, 2018	27
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	Triumeq (abacavir / dolutegravir / lamivudine)	I was the first reviewer and also posted an update in 2016, thought I would take a second and give an update.  I’m still on Triumeq and still highly recommend this drug.  After switching in 2014 (literally the day the drug was approved), I still have no side effects.  It’s been great.  Best wishes everyone.	10	June 8, 2018	14
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	Triumeq (abacavir / dolutegravir / lamivudine)	I have been HIV positive for 14 years. At first I was on Atripla. It kept me undetectable and a high CD4 (between 600-900). The main side effect that I had was very vivid, disturbing dreams.  So my doctor decided to switch me to Triumeq 4  years ago. I love it. Same high CD4 and undetectable. And I experience no side effects whatsoever. Very thankful for this drug.	10	May 27, 2018	8
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	Triumeq (abacavir / dolutegravir / lamivudine)	I have been on Triumeq for almost 2 years.  Viral load and CD4 are great.  However, I have gained almost 25 pounds....all in gut, back, chest and starting to develop a small buffalo hump.  Nothing in diet or workout regimen has changed. I have gone from a medium T-shirt to a X-Large.  33 size pants to 35 waist.  42 jacket to 44 jacket.  16 collar to a 17-1/2 collar.  Not happy with this at all.  I am seeing more and more reports of this with Triumeq users online now.	5	May 20, 2018	14
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	Triumeq (abacavir / dolutegravir / lamivudine)	I had postponed treatment for around 7 years but now have started. In my recent test my numbers were low (290 CD4) and my VL was about 16k.   This medication is amazing. So far I had no side effect whatsoever and I think a large part of the negative feedback people share could be shaped by their own apprehensions and worries.  Best of all it's easy to take. I am undetectable 4 weeks into treatment. I also feel that I have better energy and my constant worry about what the virus is doing to my body seems to have subsided for now.   Highly recommend	10	May 2, 2018	10
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	Triumeq (abacavir / dolutegravir / lamivudine)	"So I hate to be ""that"" person, but I guess I am.  Was on Genvoya/Stribild since 7/2016 with no issues whatsoever other than elevated cholesterol.  Dr. decided to change me to Triumeq, which I took for 14 days.  I have not been right at all for two weeks.  Extreme headrush (like a combo drunk/stoned feeling), anxious, no energy, itchy everywhere.  Just feel awful after taking it.  We chatted today, going back on Genvoya and cannot wait to go pick it up.  Don't let this scare you, everybody will find their med. that works w/o any side effects.  For me, that is not Triumeq."	3	April 10, 2018	16
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	Triumeq (abacavir / dolutegravir / lamivudine)	Recently started taking Triumeq almost 4 weeks ago. Use to be on the sustiva and combvr cocktail for about 5 years. Always hated taking sustiva made me feel extremely groggy, terrible dreams and so I took it upon myself to stop taking it. Went on a 3 year hiatus. Needed a break from all of it including doctor visits.(terrible idea) fell victim to pneumonia in February and ID dr put me on Triumeq. So far it’s been amazing. 1st night my head became very tingly and I felt real shaky but after that it’s been amazing. No side effects and I’ve started gaining my weight back again. Did lab work yesterday so hopefully my cd4 has gone up. My cd4 was a 12 last test. Good luck to all of you and remember you aren’t alone in this fight.		March 29, 2018	11
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	Triumeq (abacavir / dolutegravir / lamivudine)	I was diagnosed in February of 2016.  My viral load was 180,000 and my cell count was 157.  I had not been sick, but I feel I was on the verge.  I had experienced some trouble with thrush, but that was the worst at that point.  My doctor started me on Triumeq within a week of my diagnosis.  I had absolutely no side effect other than my face itching!  It was strange.  My doc seemed to think it might have been my immune system revving up and doing a number on my Rosacea.  It is better, by the way.  Within four months I was basically undetectable at 95 na d my viral load down to 375.  At last check in October of '17, I was completely undetectable and my cell count up to 567.  I am so very pleased.  Other than the face itching, which has long since stopped, I have had not a single side effect.  I do wish my cell count would go up faster, but I am so thankful that I have no side effects that I can't bring myself to complain!	10	March 11, 2018	6
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	Triumeq (abacavir / dolutegravir / lamivudine)	I found out October 2nd that I was HIV positive. Felt so unhealthy and caught it so fast. Losing weight, loss of appetite, having a really hard time sleeping when you’d always get those heat flash or waking up so hot. It was horrible in my experience. It took me a month to get this medication which is triumeq. The first medication my doctor had told me about and said it was the best one out there. I couldn’t agree more. I’ve been one this medication going on 3 months now and my counts went from 150/500 to over 240/500 within a month. I’m doing way better. I’m way healthier. Even though I don’t like the tiredness and a frequently headache. But I’m telling you this medication works really great. I’ve never felt so much better and felt so much changed since I’ve been on triumeq. I should be undetectable by my next appointment I go to in a month. I couldn’t be more grateful for this medication that could help us all through this situation.		February 10, 2018	5
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	Triumeq (abacavir / dolutegravir / lamivudine)	I was diagnosed a few days before Christmas in 2017. I was going to be put on Atripla but after hearing horror stories I asked for an alternative, after a quick blood test for a gene I was put on Triumeq and after a matter of weeks my viral load went from the hundreds-of-thousands to undetectable and my CD4 has risen ever since, I’m now at 555. I wasn’t sure if I was prescribed Triumeq or a horse tranquilliser at first but even though they are quite big it’s still easier to swallow than some paracetamols. Overall I would rate this 10/10 and the side-effects seem to be nonexistent! I know everyone is different but I do strongly suggest to anyone who is unhappy with their current medications to ask about Triumeq because for me, it’s working wonders!	10	February 9, 2018	8
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	Triumeq (abacavir / dolutegravir / lamivudine)	I was diagnosed December 2018 this is my first day taking the medication. I’m gonna update my phone progress. A little scared as I'm 3 months pregnant and don’t want my unborn to contract the virus.		January 30, 2018	7
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	Triumeq (abacavir / dolutegravir / lamivudine)	I was diagnosed December 2016 with a high viral load (I don’t remember exact numbers anymore) and a cd4 count of 201.   I went on Triumeq the day my diagnosis was confirmed.  The first 4 weeks on this were absolutely terrible.  I could not sleep, had crazy mood swings and was overall not enjoying anything.  (Perhaps it also had to do with the news of this life changing diagnosis) but at my 1 month check up I was undetectable and my cd4 had doubled to 440 making all the sleepless nights completely worth it.   A year later I have continued to be undetectable and have little side effects.   Sometimes my foot goes numb, and my arms and legs fall asleep easily. I do occasionally have night terrors and very vivid dreams, but as a horror movie buff they don’t bother me.   In my opinion this medication is amazing and one of the best out there.	9	January 28, 2018	5
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	Triumeq (abacavir / dolutegravir / lamivudine)	I have been on Triumeq for over a year now and my viral load went from hundreds of thousands to undetectable.  My immune system went from 300 to almost 600 now. I did have appendicitis and had to remove my appendix since beginning this regimen but don't know if its related. I am obese weight at 230lbs an triglycerides are now high and blood pressure too. I'm trying to lower these through change of diet and exercise. Have been experiencing burning sensations in my right big toe and foot pain periodically.  Don't know if related to the drug. Cutting back on processed meats and red meats now hence they cause more inflammation.  This helps tremendously as well as cardio exercise and plenty of water cutting out sodas now too.

Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	Triumeq (abacavir / dolutegravir / lamivudine)	Had horrible sleep problems two weeks after , and then a few weeks later started getting rash. Wouldn't recommend this to anyone trust me, you do not sleep while on this drug. I switched to epivir and tivicay and have had NO issues at all.		October 28, 2017	11
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	Triumeq (abacavir / dolutegravir / lamivudine)	Diagnosed back in 2008. Have been on Atripla for about 10 years and just switched to Triumeq this week. No major side effects whatsoever and best of all I love waking up not feeling groggy or drowsy; also no weird crazy dreams! So far any side effects have been extremely minimal to none. I look forward to this new medication which is reported to be less toxic and based on my own experience would recommend you consider making the switch.		October 24, 2017	9
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	Triumeq (abacavir / dolutegravir / lamivudine)	August 8th 2017 tested positive. Viral load 10,109 cd4 512 Started meds August 27th 2017 Retested September 28th 2017 And viral load is 49 and cd4 865 I had a few minor headaches and I now take my meds with or without food with no problems. I take my meds in the morning at my first break 10 am. Thanks to this site I was nervous at first read all the reviews and they helped me and knowing what to expect. So thought I would return the favor.	10	September 30, 2017	15
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	Triumeq (abacavir / dolutegravir / lamivudine)	Was diagnosed 8/12/17, began treatment 9/25. I was super pumped. Initially had a slight rash and my thumb didn’t work, got too stiff to move two times for like a minute.  Second day I felt great. High energy. Stayed up late. Yesterday I felt like butt all day. Sore. Stomach hurt. Especially when I swallowed food or drink. Today wasn’t a whole lot better. At least yesterday I could eat. I’ve taken 7 Advil  over quite a long and now I can feel the crappiness coming back on. Called my ID specialist and she told me to stop taking it and come in tomorrow morning. I’m disappointed. But I gotta get healthy. My Cd4 counts are 9 and viral load is is 181,000. I just want to get better.	5	September 28, 2017	11
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	Triumeq (abacavir / dolutegravir / lamivudine)	I discovered my new status in July 2017 VL 94K and CD4 126. After 4 weeks I had blood work again and I got an awesome results VL 85 and CD4 360. Hopefully I will be undetectable in my next check. I haven't gotten any symptoms like nausea, vomiting, diarrhoea, headaches etc. This medicine has been working greatly into my body.	10	August 27, 2017	7
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	Triumeq (abacavir / dolutegravir / lamivudine)	Infected HIV in February, diagnosed March through my own choice/fear/indecision started Triumeq 2 weeks ago. I have had a very positive experience so far. I have had minor side effects, slight headaches, a little dizzy spell, what feels like mucus on chest but nothing frightening apart from the one dizzy spell. I do feel better overall than I did, no more sore throat and I feel like I have more energy, though I am tired in the evenings and I sleep well. I feel my appetite has increased so am being conscious to exercise every day. I take the Triumeq pill in the morning half way through breakfast, I eat oat porridge for breakfast, eat half and then swallow Triumeq with a large glass of water, then finish porridge.  No nausea/indigestion.		August 17, 2017	8
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	Triumeq (abacavir / dolutegravir / lamivudine)	I switched to this med because my last med put me in a horrible fog (Atripla) . Triumeq is working for me but it gives me pretty bad body aches especially in my lower back where my kidney area is and around my under arms. If I have an alternative I will switch. It makes me feel pretty crappy	4	July 31, 2017	10
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	Triumeq (abacavir / dolutegravir / lamivudine)	Diagnosed in Feb of 2015 and tried 2 other drugs. The last 2 causes so much nausea and vomiting that I couldn't take it. Also, it was messing up my liver. My doctor put me on this and I've had little to no side effects. I have nausea but that's only if I take it on a empty stomach and it only last for about 20 minutes. I'm undetectable now and my CD4 count came from 14 to 376 the last time I checked last year. I'm going back in September to check my progress. This drug saved my life. I was basically on my deathbed before this drug.	9	July 22, 2017	20
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	Triumeq (abacavir / dolutegravir / lamivudine)	Terrible heartburn and intergestion. Easy to take, but went back to sustiva and combivir because of heartburn.	7	June 18, 2017	3
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	Triumeq (abacavir / dolutegravir / lamivudine)	I was born with HIV  my birth mother transfer it & had it all my life. Never taken medicine my immune system dropped drastically I got a thrush in my mouth and my skin started to break out really bad. I've been on triumeq for 3 days and I must say I think I'm only taking this medicine with food. Geez the nausea has been tough and a Lil lost of appetite I did have to use antifungals as well due to the thrush but hoping it does gets better. I'm excited for this journey, it's encouraging to read other stories... 	5	June 12, 2017	11
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	Triumeq (abacavir / dolutegravir / lamivudine)	Was diagnosed in 2002, but started taking truvada and isentress in 2010 before being put on triumeq. CD4 count was 700 and VL was undetectable.  My doctor switched me over and boy the side effects are horrible.  I had stomach aches every day but as I take this medicine they go away. I'm still undetectable  but I want my CD4 count to rise in the 1000's. I love that it is only one pill a day. I will get checked again  in August to see the progress. My numbers have never dropped. Will post in August.		June 3, 2017	5
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	Triumeq (abacavir / dolutegravir / lamivudine)	I tested positive for HIV in January this year and started treatment with Triumeq at the end of February with CD4 < 150 and VL 66,000. On 26 March I had bloodwork again, with CD4 = 415 and VL < 40.  I think the results speak for themselves, this drug is like a nuke. Zero side effects except for general malaise and fatigue during the first couple of days - which I however attribute to Immune Reconstitution Syndrome. Unless you are hypersensitive to abacavir, I believe there is scarcely anything better on the market at the moment.	10	June 2, 2017	9
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	Triumeq (abacavir / dolutegravir / lamivudine)	I was diagnosed in January 2011. My own immune system was able to manage my HIV for a couple years, but my health started to fail in 2013. I started with Atripla, and I'm still recovering from the extremely vivid nightmares I experienced.  I switched to a couple different combinations of drugs, but I couldn't adhere to the dosing schedules. Triumeq has been a godsend. One pill a day, and no nightmares. The only side effects I've experienced are upset stomach, weakness, and headaches.  I had one very bad spell where I nearly lost control of my motor functions and I fell in the bathroom and couldn't get back up for a short period of time.  Otherwise, my CD count has been stable at ~800, and I've been undetectable since 2013.	9	May 1, 2017	12
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	Triumeq (abacavir / dolutegravir / lamivudine)	This medicine worked very well for me within a month of taking it I became undetectable!! I had no major side effects. I do however get head aches every once and awhile but nothing I can't deal with.I currently crush mine and put it in yogurt so I'm still getting used to the taste...yuck..but its not that bad.	10	April 29, 2017	4
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	Triumeq (abacavir / dolutegravir / lamivudine)	Newly diagnosed and Triumeq is the only medication I've ever experienced. Just got results after taking it for 6 weeks. CD4 is just over 1,000. That's up from 764. My viral load is down from 33K to 26K. So far so good. I'm hoping to be undetectable in 3-4 months like I been reading in people's comments. I've had no apparent side effects until very recently I seem to have some jaw tightening and stiffness. But no headaches and I sleep well. I also been really gassy and I MUST EAT when I take it. But I'm a happy camper overall.	10	April 21, 2017	3
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	Triumeq (abacavir / dolutegravir / lamivudine)	I was diagnosed in Feb 2014.   My doctor did some sort of genes/DNA test to see which drug was compatible for my body.   Triumeq was the best option suited for me.  Must admit. At first. It was hard. The first month was as expected. Feeling sick and nausea. Felt like I had to eat when I took my pill. But once into the 2nd month. Things improved. The longer time went on. The less I felt any side affects.   It took me 4 months to be undetected.  By this time I felt myself again.   Now. In 2017. I can take it my meds with or without food. At any time. Sometimes I will take my meds with wine or on a complete empty stomach and feel nothing. I can still take my meds and have no side effect		March 28, 2017	10
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	Triumeq (abacavir / dolutegravir / lamivudine)	I have been HIV Positve for about 32 years.  The last cocktail  I was taking for about 8 years was Epzicom and Combivir . A year ago I changed my regimen to Triumeq . Initially, the side effects I experienced were sleeplessness, nausea and stomach gas, these symptoms lasted for about 3 months. Due to the sleeplessness, started taking the medication in the mornings  instead of the evenings. The first positive thing I noticed was that my skin became more hydrated and I had less skin eruptions. After one year on the medication I feel very normal , I continue to workout 3 times a week and my energy level is high. My Viral Load remains undetectable and my CD4 went from 800 to 1,150 . I am very happy that I made the switch to Triumeq .	10	February 24, 2017	23
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	Triumeq (abacavir / dolutegravir / lamivudine)	I take truimeq  600mg/50mg/300mg just had test shows that back being detectable again. I don't understand why I take on time every night,  any ideas why. thanks	10	February 19, 2017	5
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	Triumeq (abacavir / dolutegravir / lamivudine)	Diagnosed 5 years ago been on truvada and isentress with no problems at all!! Doctor wanted to switch me to this because it's a lot easier (1 pill once a day). Been on this for the past week and have had horrible side effects. Dizzy, no sleep, nauseous, and body/ joint pain. Switching back to my old medication tomorrow. Goodbye triumeq!!!	3	February 11, 2017	6
Abacavir, dolutegravir, and lamivudine	Triumeq (abacavir / dolutegravir / lamivudine)	My physician put me on Triumeq about 12 months ago.  I had been on other anti-viral medications that were not effective in controlling viral load, and CD 4 counts.  I began taking Triumeq and no side effects whatsoever, with the exception of mild fatique.  I also have type 2 diabetes & cardio vascular disease.  I am 65 years old, and enjoy a healthy life style, thanks to this medication.  I strongly urge anyone to discuss this option with their health professional.	10	February 9, 2017	5
Abaloparatide	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	I am just now starting my 4th month.  I don’t have any serious side effects; however I was already being treated for heart palpitations so that may be why!  I do get tired during the day.  Sometimes I feel like I can ‘feel my bones’.  My problems areas include my spine -4.7 and my hip.  I plan to have a bone scan after 6 months to see if there’s been progress.  If not, I’ll need to make a decision of whether or not to continue.  I takes my injections in the morning.	7	April 19, 2021	0
Abaloparatide	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	I am just about finished with my second pen.  I switched to injecting at bed time because of side effects and that has worked well.  I do get the dizziness and palpitations. During the day I do experience fatigue and brain fog but seems to be lessening.  I have fractured 3 vertebrae and have a score of -4.3 in my spine so I am planning on staying on it.	9	April 10, 2021	3
Abaloparatide	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	I’ve been on Tymlos for a month now. My problem is itching. I can hardly sleep at night the itching is so bad. Not sure if I will continue. Does anyone else have this problem.	4	March 25, 2021	0
Abaloparatide	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	Take it at night, have slight headache and pressure behind my ears, but not horrible.  I have ‘ill feeling’ after injection, but I go to sleep fairly quickly after.   Palpitations are there, but it calms down after a while.  I am on my first pen about 2 Weeks in.  So far, tolerable.   However, I am very interested in why the Tymlos hasn’t had more facts available to the public.   Why does it cause the pain in the bones ( I am guessing it’s caused from bone growth.)		March 15, 2021	3
Abaloparatide	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	Christmas Eve 2019 bent over and picked up a box. Fractured L4 and collapsed spine. Did a bone density test  in January to find a -3.8!  Definitely severe osteoporosis. Started tymlos in February. Been on it for almost a year. Did another bone density test to see if working. So grateful and thankful it’s now at -2.7. I’m still on it for another year and I know it’ll get even better!  It works. Of course had side effects, headache and raced heart but used to it. Sometime still effects but not always. Only downside but it has worked!	9	February 23, 2021	7
Abaloparatide	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	I was on Tymlos for about 5 weeks — I gave it a good try. I had to inject at night before bed because of the palpitations and nausea — but then I dreaded going to bed. The main symptom that has bothered me so much and still is after being off it for a week is bone pain, which I did not have before. It wakes me up at night. I hope it goes away. I’ll be starting Prolia soon and hope to have fewer side effects.	2	February 2, 2021	8
Abaloparatide	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	OMG . This drug Tymlos did a number on me. I have been off it over a week because I woke up after two weeks of vertigo and fatigue and cloudy urine and feeling just horrible with a trigger finger on my left thumb. Then the pain went up my arm to my shoulder and I couldn't lift my arm, then it went to both arms. Two weeks after I have stopped I am still waking up with a severe trigger finger. The pain is crazy in the mornings. Of course the doctor and the nurse who helped me said they had never heard of this side effect. I hope this is not permanent. But if it continues I will be doing a lot more investigation into any one else getting these crazy side effects.	1	January 27, 2021	9
Abaloparatide	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	I had steadily, rapidly, worsening osteoporosis. Could not tolerate bisphosphonates and they did not give me any improvement. Did the full 18 months on Tymlos. I had occasional headaches and low BP but no big deal. The BMD I just had after therapy was done was great-overall 11% improvement. My lumbar especially-went from  -3.0 to  -2.1.  The injections were a drag but it was definitely worth it.	9	January 15, 2021	16
Abaloparatide	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	I started Tymlos 1 month the ago. I do have some palpitations but goes away after half hour. I inject before I go to sleep so I just lie down after taking it. Hopefully, this will help my bones. I plan to stay on it for 1 year. Then get a new Dexa to check my T score.		January 13, 2021	5
Abaloparatide	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	I had a hysterectomy at age 27, unable tolerate hormones  later was unable to tolerate osteoporosis medications tried several. Have been on Tymlos 7 months only side effect is the fatigue, but I can get through that. Hoping that this helps as the cost is going to keep me from staying on it. I am 69 my hip score was -3.5	5	January 8, 2021	6
Abaloparatide	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	Just started second Tymlos pen for osteoporosis. Side effects after injection (which start 15 min or so after) lasted 3.5-4.0 hours initially, down to 15-20 minutes now.  Initial side effects: “Drugged like feeling” (lightheaded, dizzy, brain fog, out of it) Fatigue Heart pounding   Other side effects that linger daily:  Initial severe bone pain which has slowly decreased.  Vertigo which is still present  Fatigue  Weight gain  Brain fog.   Due to my career and safety role, I have been out of work on std, due to the above side effects. As they are lessening, they are still present which may cause me to end use of this drug.	2	January 1, 2021	6
Abaloparatide	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	I wanted to update my experience.  Now after having been on Tymlos for 2 weeks, I am happy to report the side effects disappeared after the first week.  I also injected on alternate days for the 1st week which helped a lot. Injecting before bed was a big mistake for an insomniac like me. Just made me focus on my elevated pulse. I find injecting just before I exercise to works great.	9	December 21, 2020	12
Abaloparatide	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	Tymlos is the worst drug ever. Took it for a little over 2 months.  Extreme nausea almost immediately every day. Migraine every day.  Daily between 3 and 4PM every joint ached so bad I had to lay down.  Constantly felt like I had the flu. Or like I was on chemo. I have been off of it for over 2 months yet still have symptoms which I didn't have before taking it.  I am afraid permanent damage has been done.  Going to try a tablet next. This medication should be taken off the market.  Oh wait, big pharma doesn't care about you its all about that dollar.	1	December 3, 2020	11
Abaloparatide	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	My first week on Tymlos was excruciating! About five minutes after taking the injection I had heart palpitations, a severe headache, my teeth hurt so bad and then the lower back spasms started and I cried out in pain. It was horrible. I called my prescribing doctor after the first couple of days and she said that she had never heard of anyone having the side effects I described. They made me feel like I was crazy for saying that it was so horrible. I have now suffered through a little over a month of this drug. Although not so intense I still have heart palpitations and now severe thigh and feet cramps. I feel terrible and don't know how much more of this I can take. I am 59 years old and I work full time and am a very busy person and this has made my quality of life very bad. I hope it is worth it!	3	November 30, 2020	14
Abaloparatide	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	Six Tymlos injections so far at half dose (4 clicks).  First day side effects were just feeling odd.  Trouble sleeping on night 2.  With the first few injections, there were hot flashes, shocks, and pains that quickly moved around my body.  Also headaches that lasted about 20 hours and muscle pains as if I'd been in a car accident.  I wondered if the benefits could outweigh the sense that my body was being poisoned.  After the fourth dose, things started calming down some.  The most persistent effect is a tolerable pain in my lower left back that began with the first injection and hasn't gone away yet.  I was told to ramp up the dose from half (4 clicks) to 5 clicks on the 5th night.  Not wanting more bad side effects, I have put that off.  The PA who prescribed indicated that some people can't tolerate going up from a half dose.  If that's me, I wonder, will half a dose do any good for my bones?  Or will I inject myself and go through side effects for 2 years for no benefit?	4	November 22, 2020	6
Abaloparatide	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	I was apprehensive about taking this Tymlos injection because I’m always sensitive to medications. I took the shot Thursday night at 915 immediately had lightheadedness and fatigue heart palpitations. The heart palpitations went away lightheadedness and fatigue stayed. I went to bed at 11pm , was awakened by horrible reflux at 3am. Fell back to sleep was awakened at 5am severe pain in my entire head, teeth, gums, etc. sat up to get Tylenol and was totally blind in my left eye. I woke my husband he took me to emergency room. Spent 7 hours being tested , 2 CT Scans, expert eye examinations, neurological testing, blood tests all normal tests. I try never to take pain medication because it makes me nauseous but they said it would be baby does. Ok . Well wound up dry heaving for 3 hrs. Finally released went home. Once pain meds wore off, pain in head started again. I took 2 gabapentin s, 2 Xanax and slept all night. I woke up Saturday morning same pain in head, the pain jumps all around .	1	November 7, 2020	16
Abaloparatide		This medicine gave me horrible side effects, high blood pressure, heart palpitations after the 1st dose. Felt like a sword going through my back radiating through my body. I'm 28 hours into it and will never do it again. I asked about heart palpitations and blood pressure and was told they were not in the side effects.	1	October 13, 2020	0
Abaloparatide	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	I used Tymlos for 3 months initially.  Prior to my first injection, my blood pressure was perfect. After the injection, my BP would climb to 185-195/90-95 and the heart palpitations would start.  At night, insomnia and leg cramps would arrive. My doctor took me off for one month - no heart palpitations, no insomnia, no leg cramps and blood pressure back to 115/65. My doctor asked me to start again. This time it was worse. BP even higher and heart palpitations more pronounced - extreme chest pains, as well. The leg cramps were brutal and my achilles tendon in my left leg started hurting and burning. Eight years ago I ruptured it in TRX as a result of being on Levaquin. For seven years I have had no pain, no issues whatsoever in exercising until I restarted the Tymlos.  I just went in for an MRI, the Achilles repair is intact - however, I now have damage just above - the tendon has thinned and I am on severe restrictions to avoid another rupture.  I am off of Tymlos.	1	September 25, 2020	34
Abaloparatide	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	Tymlos Is effective because my numbers on spine getting down little but side effects are strong , like : vertigo and heart palpitations are very strong and I feel very weak next day after injection.	5	September 4, 2020	22
Abaloparatide	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	I am 77 and my bone results just get worse each time.First injection of Tymlos on 7-23-20. Two hours later, a low grade fever. Next night, the same thing. Third night, didn't inject and no fever. I cannot take this drug and told my doctor that.	1	August 6, 2020	24
Abaloparatide	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	Did not do well on tymlos. High 24 hr. urine ca. scores - hypercalcinuria. Started tymlos June 2019; stopped April 11 2020. Other issues: cramps in legs, mental fog starting second month,  joint pain in hands, tiredness on a daily basis. Got new rheumatologist; second opinion. Started prolia today. Should have monitored bone markers more carefully both before and during treatment of tymlos. Now I know. New doc. will do blood tests and urine every 3 months. tymlos not for me.	5	August 4, 2020	23
Abaloparatide	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	I have had osteoporosis for many years due to having a complete hysterectomy at age 29 I was on pills it had to be taken off because of it loosening my teeth I lost many teeth. I have been on this medication since approximately November of 2019 I have read all of your side effects it is so hard for me to give you my opinion since I have other conditions like bulging disc scoliosis arthritis. Can tell you that I have had a lot of itching in the palms of my hands and the bottom of my feet I have had cramping in my toes and arch of my foot. It's hard to say about my back since I have back problems and I have had insomnia for many years now so I cannot say that this medication has caused those two problems I have been getting headaches more recently but again I have problems with discs in my neck as well all from a motorcycle accident. I am willing to try this medication to see if there is any Improvement.	7	August 2, 2020	13
Abaloparatide	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	I have had 5 compression fractures.  And 1 broken rib since as 51 I'm now 55. My osteoporosis is from prednisone!  I was tall at 5.9 now I am 5.4 and my organs are being crushed. I have a hunch back from repeated compression fractures. My neck is like 4 inches forward. I've lost most of my mobility. Can barely get out of chair or bed. I can't garden anymore or do chores. No choice but to take big pharma poisons again. Taking Tymlos for 5 days now. Was no side effects until night 4. So I am taking it at night. I actually inject into fatty part of my thigh. So day 4. Could not sleep a wink. Heart racing, neuropathy whole body, stomach pains, gas, heartburn, dizzy, leg pain. Oh joy now this for 18 months. It better grow bone.  I've read if you get a compression fracture get a kyphoplasty! To stabilize the fracture regain vertebral height and get out of pain and no hunch back! The medical field and big pharma aren't here to help. Just now live in a nightmare that I can not awake from.	6	July 27, 2020	26
Abaloparatide	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	After the 1st injection I had back and leg pain, headache, and heart pounding.  The headache lasted about 20 hours  along with an ill feeling.  The next 2 injections the back and leg pain were much less, but still the headache and slightly ill feeling.  Now 8 days in, just slight pain and occasional heart pounding, but only for a short period of time.		July 1, 2020	26
Abaloparatide	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	After 6 months on Tymlos, the ONLY side effects I've noticed are occasional heart palpitations that go away in minutes.	8	June 29, 2020	34
Abaloparatide	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	On Tymlos for 3 months , severe insomnia.	6	June 28, 2020	19
Abaloparatide	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	Hi..reviewed this drug 3 weeks ago. I've been on tymlos only 1 month. I had spinal fracture in the past also multiple other fractures from falling from standing position. Anyway I have back pain from fractures but the back pain on tymlos was so severe I have stopped it.  I had headache after injection just take tylenol.  Fatigue another problem and nausea.  I took zofran.  i will ask dr to try prolia. Oh I am 69 diagnosed at 50 with osteoporosis but was always afraid of side effects..good luck..	3	June 15, 2020	20
Abaloparatide	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	Tymlos for 2 months my side effect were fatigue, constant nausea, finally had to stop. I felt like I was poisoned. A year later and I am having significant leg pain	2	June 15, 2020	19
Abaloparatide	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	I just took my first injections and had intense lower back pain like a spasm; it took my breath. My dr said was not associated with med.  The next night wasn’t so intense and lasted shorter period. Slight headache also. The list of side effects doesn’t mention intense back pain.   My dr strongly suggested I continue to see if side effects go away or become tolerable. Any one else experience this?		June 12, 2020	31
Abaloparatide	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	I used Tymlos for approximately four months after the first  month-and-a-half two months I started having leg and back pain really bad. The nurse practitioner talked me into keep taking it so I took it another month and a half. Then I was hurting so bad I had to go to the emergency room. I started growing bone in my legs, so it was like growing pains. This is what they told me but it hurts so bad that I quit I couldn't take it any longer that was the only side effect I had but I couldn't couldn't stand it as up every night	1	June 2, 2020	28
Abaloparatide	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	On Tymlos for 1 month. Won’t make 2 years on this med. Probably only another month then switching to Prolia even though I know it doesn’t build bone. With Tymlos the constant headache, palpitations, nausea are very unsettling. However the bone/muscle pains the last few days have been the last straw. Can’t sleep. Can’t get comfortable.	4	May 5, 2020	18
Abaloparatide	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	I had Tymlos and got side effects of an instant headache, racing of heart and spinning. Headache is a pressure headache and it lasts for hours. This is day in and day out.  I have been on Tymlos for 4 weeks and it’s just the same thing every night. I can’t sleep. I tried it this morning to see if it makes a difference and it ruined my day. I am having surgery on my back in 3 months so it’s essential... but I don’t know if I can take it much longer. It’s wrecking my quality of life.	4	April 9, 2020	29
Abaloparatide	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	I take my Tymols shot  every morning and about 10 minutes after I always get a slight headache lasts about an hour. but, has anyone else had severe leg and feet cramps. They are so bad I am out of bed 4 or 5 times a night.	4	April 8, 2020	25
Abaloparatide	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	I started Tymlos 3/12/20 and decided to discontinue it due to heart palpitations and anxiety.  I also had terrible insomnia with it.  I took the injection at night before bed but when I tried taking the injection in the morning I would have to lie down because it made me so tired (go figure).  With all of the Covid 19 worries I sure don't need my heart racing anymore than it already is.  Also the black box warning of Osteosarcoma worries me a lot frankly.	1	April 6, 2020	28
Abaloparatide	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	So I have been on Tymlos and  I agree to others commenting on the severe back pain!  But why?  I haven’t found an answer. Also extreme dizziness.  Like nothing I have experienced.  All the time not just after the shot.  I’m been taking it for 5 months. Not sure I can do it for the 2 years the dr wants me to.	3	March 19, 2020	28
Abaloparatide	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	I have been using Tymlos 2 months at this time,  and causes side effects of severe nausea .	6	March 17, 2020	22
Abaloparatide	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	I have been on Tymlos for a month and a half. The only side effect I’ve noticed is that after some injections my heart races for a bit. Not every time. Sometimes upper stomach pain but rarely. I really hope it makes my bones stronger. I’m willing to stay with this the eighteen months if it builds my bones.	8	February 28, 2020	31
Abaloparatide	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	I found out I had a t score of 3.5 at age 55. They told me I have osteoporosis in my spine. I’ve been using Tymlos for almost two months. The first time I used it I had what other mentioned  pain in the back. It was very intense. I tried it the following day and it didn’t cause the same pain. Each day following was fine. I have minor back pain after each injection but use a heating pad to relax it. It is bearable.  I’ve heard such good results so I’m looking forward to having a bone density scan after 18 months that I’m suppose to be on it.		February 2, 2020	30
Abaloparatide	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	Have been on Tymlos 2 weeks. Will the back pain and palpitations   subside  after being on drug for a while.	3	January 24, 2020	13
Abaloparatide	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	I did my first Tymlos injection in the evening before bedtime.   Within minutes I had unbearable excruciating lower back pain.  So extreme that I sat down in a chair screaming in pain.  My partner had to call 911.  I was taken to the hospital where I was monitored for several hours until the pain went away.   I normally have low blood pressure.  Upon arrival in the ER it was extremely high. Dangerously so from the pain the drug caused me to have.   I would never do that again.    My prescribing doctor insisted that I must have injured my lower back simultaneously.  I certainly did not.  It was the Tymlos that caused the problem.   The attending ER doctor advised me to never try that drug again as I had a severe allergic reaction to it.   Would mention here that I have no other known allergies.	1	January 22, 2020	42
Abaloparatide	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	I've been on  Tymlos for 2 days, have side effects of severe pain in my back radiating  up my back and heart palpitations  and head hurting bad it lasts for 1 hour.	1	January 22, 2020	27
Abaloparatide	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	I am 72 in an osteopenia stage and had multiple fractures.  Forteo gave me too many side effects.  Therefore, I have been taking Tymlos for 10 months.  Compared to Forteo, Tymlos has been tolerable.  The only negatives have been my high calcium score and joint stiffness.  Because of the high calcium, my dosage has been reduced to 40 mcg every other day.  Has anyone experienced this crippling stiffness?		November 1, 2019	34
Abaloparatide		Suffered severe tachycardia less than 15 minutes after the abaloparatide injection. Took an hour for heart rate to go down. Experience palpitations for 48 hours, dizziness and incredible sleepiness.	1	October 22, 2019	3
Abaloparatide	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	I experienced severe headaches 3-4 hours after each injection which actually woke me up every night. I also experienced upper abdominal pain. AND, after taking Tymlos for 1 month, my hair started falling out.  I'm still trying to convince my doctor that I experienced all of these side effects.  Especially since he wants me to switch to Forteo which has even MORE side effects.	3	October 2, 2019	29
Abaloparatide	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	I injected this drug Tymlos daily for 18 months. I had a bone density scan done within two weeks of starting and 6 weeks after end of treatment. My later scan showed only a very slight improvement in my lower spine and my scores were worse in my hip .  I’m so disappointed that I did not have significant improvement in my osteoporosis especially since the treatment was so uncomfortable and so expensive. I just hope that I don’t develop cancer or kidney problems from using this drug.	2	September 12, 2019	53
Abaloparatide	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	Started after multiple spinal fractures- helped with bone building and pain - definitely a God send - only side effect is itching - I can deal with that	10	June 16, 2019	44
Abaloparatide	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	Severe back pain,  like almost unbearable at times.	2	May 28, 2019	37
Abaloparatide	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	This is my Tymlos review after trying it. You might want to know what are the side effects of Tymlos? For me I had leg pain, stomach cramps, headache, body pains		May 3, 2019	70
Abaloparatide		This prescription has made me very tired.  All I wanted to do is sleep it has also caused wheezing when I was on for 3 days in a row  then off every other day the wheezing and breathing got better.  Then instructed to go back on every day  and by  day 3 wheezing coughing and shortness of breath   took myself off completely at day 3 and it's been 3 weeks and still tired and coughing with shortness of breath	1	March 12, 2018	11
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	I am just now starting my 4th month.  I don’t have any serious side effects; however I was already being treated for heart palpitations so that may be why!  I do get tired during the day.  Sometimes I feel like I can ‘feel my bones’.  My problems areas include my spine -4.7 and my hip.  I plan to have a bone scan after 6 months to see if there’s been progress.  If not, I’ll need to make a decision of whether or not to continue.  I takes my injections in the morning.	7	April 19, 2021	0
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	I am just about finished with my second pen.  I switched to injecting at bed time because of side effects and that has worked well.  I do get the dizziness and palpitations. During the day I do experience fatigue and brain fog but seems to be lessening.  I have fractured 3 vertebrae and have a score of -4.3 in my spine so I am planning on staying on it.	9	April 10, 2021	3
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	I’ve been on Tymlos for a month now. My problem is itching. I can hardly sleep at night the itching is so bad. Not sure if I will continue. Does anyone else have this problem.	4	March 25, 2021	0
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	Take it at night, have slight headache and pressure behind my ears, but not horrible.  I have ‘ill feeling’ after injection, but I go to sleep fairly quickly after.   Palpitations are there, but it calms down after a while.  I am on my first pen about 2 Weeks in.  So far, tolerable.   However, I am very interested in why the Tymlos hasn’t had more facts available to the public.   Why does it cause the pain in the bones ( I am guessing it’s caused from bone growth.)		March 15, 2021	3
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	Christmas Eve 2019 bent over and picked up a box. Fractured L4 and collapsed spine. Did a bone density test  in January to find a -3.8!  Definitely severe osteoporosis. Started tymlos in February. Been on it for almost a year. Did another bone density test to see if working. So grateful and thankful it’s now at -2.7. I’m still on it for another year and I know it’ll get even better!  It works. Of course had side effects, headache and raced heart but used to it. Sometime still effects but not always. Only downside but it has worked!	9	February 23, 2021	7
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	I was on Tymlos for about 5 weeks — I gave it a good try. I had to inject at night before bed because of the palpitations and nausea — but then I dreaded going to bed. The main symptom that has bothered me so much and still is after being off it for a week is bone pain, which I did not have before. It wakes me up at night. I hope it goes away. I’ll be starting Prolia soon and hope to have fewer side effects.	2	February 2, 2021	8
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	OMG . This drug Tymlos did a number on me. I have been off it over a week because I woke up after two weeks of vertigo and fatigue and cloudy urine and feeling just horrible with a trigger finger on my left thumb. Then the pain went up my arm to my shoulder and I couldn't lift my arm, then it went to both arms. Two weeks after I have stopped I am still waking up with a severe trigger finger. The pain is crazy in the mornings. Of course the doctor and the nurse who helped me said they had never heard of this side effect. I hope this is not permanent. But if it continues I will be doing a lot more investigation into any one else getting these crazy side effects.	1	January 27, 2021	9
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	I had steadily, rapidly, worsening osteoporosis. Could not tolerate bisphosphonates and they did not give me any improvement. Did the full 18 months on Tymlos. I had occasional headaches and low BP but no big deal. The BMD I just had after therapy was done was great-overall 11% improvement. My lumbar especially-went from  -3.0 to  -2.1.  The injections were a drag but it was definitely worth it.	9	January 15, 2021	16
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	I started Tymlos 1 month the ago. I do have some palpitations but goes away after half hour. I inject before I go to sleep so I just lie down after taking it. Hopefully, this will help my bones. I plan to stay on it for 1 year. Then get a new Dexa to check my T score.		January 13, 2021	5
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	I had a hysterectomy at age 27, unable tolerate hormones  later was unable to tolerate osteoporosis medications tried several. Have been on Tymlos 7 months only side effect is the fatigue, but I can get through that. Hoping that this helps as the cost is going to keep me from staying on it. I am 69 my hip score was -3.5	5	January 8, 2021	6
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	Just started second Tymlos pen for osteoporosis. Side effects after injection (which start 15 min or so after) lasted 3.5-4.0 hours initially, down to 15-20 minutes now.  Initial side effects: “Drugged like feeling” (lightheaded, dizzy, brain fog, out of it) Fatigue Heart pounding   Other side effects that linger daily:  Initial severe bone pain which has slowly decreased.  Vertigo which is still present  Fatigue  Weight gain  Brain fog.   Due to my career and safety role, I have been out of work on std, due to the above side effects. As they are lessening, they are still present which may cause me to end use of this drug.	2	January 1, 2021	6
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	I wanted to update my experience.  Now after having been on Tymlos for 2 weeks, I am happy to report the side effects disappeared after the first week.  I also injected on alternate days for the 1st week which helped a lot. Injecting before bed was a big mistake for an insomniac like me. Just made me focus on my elevated pulse. I find injecting just before I exercise to works great.	9	December 21, 2020	12
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	Tymlos is the worst drug ever. Took it for a little over 2 months.  Extreme nausea almost immediately every day. Migraine every day.  Daily between 3 and 4PM every joint ached so bad I had to lay down.  Constantly felt like I had the flu. Or like I was on chemo. I have been off of it for over 2 months yet still have symptoms which I didn't have before taking it.  I am afraid permanent damage has been done.  Going to try a tablet next. This medication should be taken off the market.  Oh wait, big pharma doesn't care about you its all about that dollar.	1	December 3, 2020	11
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	My first week on Tymlos was excruciating! About five minutes after taking the injection I had heart palpitations, a severe headache, my teeth hurt so bad and then the lower back spasms started and I cried out in pain. It was horrible. I called my prescribing doctor after the first couple of days and she said that she had never heard of anyone having the side effects I described. They made me feel like I was crazy for saying that it was so horrible. I have now suffered through a little over a month of this drug. Although not so intense I still have heart palpitations and now severe thigh and feet cramps. I feel terrible and don't know how much more of this I can take. I am 59 years old and I work full time and am a very busy person and this has made my quality of life very bad. I hope it is worth it!	3	November 30, 2020	14
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	Six Tymlos injections so far at half dose (4 clicks).  First day side effects were just feeling odd.  Trouble sleeping on night 2.  With the first few injections, there were hot flashes, shocks, and pains that quickly moved around my body.  Also headaches that lasted about 20 hours and muscle pains as if I'd been in a car accident.  I wondered if the benefits could outweigh the sense that my body was being poisoned.  After the fourth dose, things started calming down some.  The most persistent effect is a tolerable pain in my lower left back that began with the first injection and hasn't gone away yet.  I was told to ramp up the dose from half (4 clicks) to 5 clicks on the 5th night.  Not wanting more bad side effects, I have put that off.  The PA who prescribed indicated that some people can't tolerate going up from a half dose.  If that's me, I wonder, will half a dose do any good for my bones?  Or will I inject myself and go through side effects for 2 years for no benefit?	4	November 22, 2020	6
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	I was apprehensive about taking this Tymlos injection because I’m always sensitive to medications. I took the shot Thursday night at 915 immediately had lightheadedness and fatigue heart palpitations. The heart palpitations went away lightheadedness and fatigue stayed. I went to bed at 11pm , was awakened by horrible reflux at 3am. Fell back to sleep was awakened at 5am severe pain in my entire head, teeth, gums, etc. sat up to get Tylenol and was totally blind in my left eye. I woke my husband he took me to emergency room. Spent 7 hours being tested , 2 CT Scans, expert eye examinations, neurological testing, blood tests all normal tests. I try never to take pain medication because it makes me nauseous but they said it would be baby does. Ok . Well wound up dry heaving for 3 hrs. Finally released went home. Once pain meds wore off, pain in head started again. I took 2 gabapentin s, 2 Xanax and slept all night. I woke up Saturday morning same pain in head, the pain jumps all around .	1	November 7, 2020	16
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)		This medicine gave me horrible side effects, high blood pressure, heart palpitations after the 1st dose. Felt like a sword going through my back radiating through my body. I'm 28 hours into it and will never do it again. I asked about heart palpitations and blood pressure and was told they were not in the side effects.	1	October 13, 2020	0
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	I used Tymlos for 3 months initially.  Prior to my first injection, my blood pressure was perfect. After the injection, my BP would climb to 185-195/90-95 and the heart palpitations would start.  At night, insomnia and leg cramps would arrive. My doctor took me off for one month - no heart palpitations, no insomnia, no leg cramps and blood pressure back to 115/65. My doctor asked me to start again. This time it was worse. BP even higher and heart palpitations more pronounced - extreme chest pains, as well. The leg cramps were brutal and my achilles tendon in my left leg started hurting and burning. Eight years ago I ruptured it in TRX as a result of being on Levaquin. For seven years I have had no pain, no issues whatsoever in exercising until I restarted the Tymlos.  I just went in for an MRI, the Achilles repair is intact - however, I now have damage just above - the tendon has thinned and I am on severe restrictions to avoid another rupture.  I am off of Tymlos.	1	September 25, 2020	34
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	Tymlos Is effective because my numbers on spine getting down little but side effects are strong , like : vertigo and heart palpitations are very strong and I feel very weak next day after injection.	5	September 4, 2020	22
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	I am 77 and my bone results just get worse each time.First injection of Tymlos on 7-23-20. Two hours later, a low grade fever. Next night, the same thing. Third night, didn't inject and no fever. I cannot take this drug and told my doctor that.	1	August 6, 2020	24
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	Did not do well on tymlos. High 24 hr. urine ca. scores - hypercalcinuria. Started tymlos June 2019; stopped April 11 2020. Other issues: cramps in legs, mental fog starting second month,  joint pain in hands, tiredness on a daily basis. Got new rheumatologist; second opinion. Started prolia today. Should have monitored bone markers more carefully both before and during treatment of tymlos. Now I know. New doc. will do blood tests and urine every 3 months. tymlos not for me.	5	August 4, 2020	23
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	I have had osteoporosis for many years due to having a complete hysterectomy at age 29 I was on pills it had to be taken off because of it loosening my teeth I lost many teeth. I have been on this medication since approximately November of 2019 I have read all of your side effects it is so hard for me to give you my opinion since I have other conditions like bulging disc scoliosis arthritis. Can tell you that I have had a lot of itching in the palms of my hands and the bottom of my feet I have had cramping in my toes and arch of my foot. It's hard to say about my back since I have back problems and I have had insomnia for many years now so I cannot say that this medication has caused those two problems I have been getting headaches more recently but again I have problems with discs in my neck as well all from a motorcycle accident. I am willing to try this medication to see if there is any Improvement.	7	August 2, 2020	13
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	I have had 5 compression fractures.  And 1 broken rib since as 51 I'm now 55. My osteoporosis is from prednisone!  I was tall at 5.9 now I am 5.4 and my organs are being crushed. I have a hunch back from repeated compression fractures. My neck is like 4 inches forward. I've lost most of my mobility. Can barely get out of chair or bed. I can't garden anymore or do chores. No choice but to take big pharma poisons again. Taking Tymlos for 5 days now. Was no side effects until night 4. So I am taking it at night. I actually inject into fatty part of my thigh. So day 4. Could not sleep a wink. Heart racing, neuropathy whole body, stomach pains, gas, heartburn, dizzy, leg pain. Oh joy now this for 18 months. It better grow bone.  I've read if you get a compression fracture get a kyphoplasty! To stabilize the fracture regain vertebral height and get out of pain and no hunch back! The medical field and big pharma aren't here to help. Just now live in a nightmare that I can not awake from.	6	July 27, 2020	26
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	After the 1st injection I had back and leg pain, headache, and heart pounding.  The headache lasted about 20 hours  along with an ill feeling.  The next 2 injections the back and leg pain were much less, but still the headache and slightly ill feeling.  Now 8 days in, just slight pain and occasional heart pounding, but only for a short period of time.		July 1, 2020	26
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	After 6 months on Tymlos, the ONLY side effects I've noticed are occasional heart palpitations that go away in minutes.	8	June 29, 2020	34

Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	Hi..reviewed this drug 3 weeks ago. I've been on tymlos only 1 month. I had spinal fracture in the past also multiple other fractures from falling from standing position. Anyway I have back pain from fractures but the back pain on tymlos was so severe I have stopped it.  I had headache after injection just take tylenol.  Fatigue another problem and nausea.  I took zofran.  i will ask dr to try prolia. Oh I am 69 diagnosed at 50 with osteoporosis but was always afraid of side effects..good luck..	3	June 15, 2020	20
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	Tymlos for 2 months my side effect were fatigue, constant nausea, finally had to stop. I felt like I was poisoned. A year later and I am having significant leg pain	2	June 15, 2020	19
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	I just took my first injections and had intense lower back pain like a spasm; it took my breath. My dr said was not associated with med.  The next night wasn’t so intense and lasted shorter period. Slight headache also. The list of side effects doesn’t mention intense back pain.   My dr strongly suggested I continue to see if side effects go away or become tolerable. Any one else experience this?		June 12, 2020	31
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	I used Tymlos for approximately four months after the first  month-and-a-half two months I started having leg and back pain really bad. The nurse practitioner talked me into keep taking it so I took it another month and a half. Then I was hurting so bad I had to go to the emergency room. I started growing bone in my legs, so it was like growing pains. This is what they told me but it hurts so bad that I quit I couldn't take it any longer that was the only side effect I had but I couldn't couldn't stand it as up every night	1	June 2, 2020	28
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	On Tymlos for 1 month. Won’t make 2 years on this med. Probably only another month then switching to Prolia even though I know it doesn’t build bone. With Tymlos the constant headache, palpitations, nausea are very unsettling. However the bone/muscle pains the last few days have been the last straw. Can’t sleep. Can’t get comfortable.	4	May 5, 2020	18
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	I had Tymlos and got side effects of an instant headache, racing of heart and spinning. Headache is a pressure headache and it lasts for hours. This is day in and day out.  I have been on Tymlos for 4 weeks and it’s just the same thing every night. I can’t sleep. I tried it this morning to see if it makes a difference and it ruined my day. I am having surgery on my back in 3 months so it’s essential... but I don’t know if I can take it much longer. It’s wrecking my quality of life.	4	April 9, 2020	29
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	I take my Tymols shot  every morning and about 10 minutes after I always get a slight headache lasts about an hour. but, has anyone else had severe leg and feet cramps. They are so bad I am out of bed 4 or 5 times a night.	4	April 8, 2020	25
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	I started Tymlos 3/12/20 and decided to discontinue it due to heart palpitations and anxiety.  I also had terrible insomnia with it.  I took the injection at night before bed but when I tried taking the injection in the morning I would have to lie down because it made me so tired (go figure).  With all of the Covid 19 worries I sure don't need my heart racing anymore than it already is.  Also the black box warning of Osteosarcoma worries me a lot frankly.	1	April 6, 2020	28
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	So I have been on Tymlos and  I agree to others commenting on the severe back pain!  But why?  I haven’t found an answer. Also extreme dizziness.  Like nothing I have experienced.  All the time not just after the shot.  I’m been taking it for 5 months. Not sure I can do it for the 2 years the dr wants me to.	3	March 19, 2020	28
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	I have been using Tymlos 2 months at this time,  and causes side effects of severe nausea .	6	March 17, 2020	22
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	I have been on Tymlos for a month and a half. The only side effect I’ve noticed is that after some injections my heart races for a bit. Not every time. Sometimes upper stomach pain but rarely. I really hope it makes my bones stronger. I’m willing to stay with this the eighteen months if it builds my bones.	8	February 28, 2020	31
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	I found out I had a t score of 3.5 at age 55. They told me I have osteoporosis in my spine. I’ve been using Tymlos for almost two months. The first time I used it I had what other mentioned  pain in the back. It was very intense. I tried it the following day and it didn’t cause the same pain. Each day following was fine. I have minor back pain after each injection but use a heating pad to relax it. It is bearable.  I’ve heard such good results so I’m looking forward to having a bone density scan after 18 months that I’m suppose to be on it.		February 2, 2020	30

Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	I did my first Tymlos injection in the evening before bedtime.   Within minutes I had unbearable excruciating lower back pain.  So extreme that I sat down in a chair screaming in pain.  My partner had to call 911.  I was taken to the hospital where I was monitored for several hours until the pain went away.   I normally have low blood pressure.  Upon arrival in the ER it was extremely high. Dangerously so from the pain the drug caused me to have.   I would never do that again.    My prescribing doctor insisted that I must have injured my lower back simultaneously.  I certainly did not.  It was the Tymlos that caused the problem.   The attending ER doctor advised me to never try that drug again as I had a severe allergic reaction to it.   Would mention here that I have no other known allergies.	1	January 22, 2020	42

Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	I am 72 in an osteopenia stage and had multiple fractures.  Forteo gave me too many side effects.  Therefore, I have been taking Tymlos for 10 months.  Compared to Forteo, Tymlos has been tolerable.  The only negatives have been my high calcium score and joint stiffness.  Because of the high calcium, my dosage has been reduced to 40 mcg every other day.  Has anyone experienced this crippling stiffness?		November 1, 2019	34
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)		Suffered severe tachycardia less than 15 minutes after the abaloparatide injection. Took an hour for heart rate to go down. Experience palpitations for 48 hours, dizziness and incredible sleepiness.	1	October 22, 2019	3
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	I experienced severe headaches 3-4 hours after each injection which actually woke me up every night. I also experienced upper abdominal pain. AND, after taking Tymlos for 1 month, my hair started falling out.  I'm still trying to convince my doctor that I experienced all of these side effects.  Especially since he wants me to switch to Forteo which has even MORE side effects.	3	October 2, 2019	29
Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)	Tymlos (abaloparatide)	I injected this drug Tymlos daily for 18 months. I had a bone density scan done within two weeks of starting and 6 weeks after end of treatment. My later scan showed only a very slight improvement in my lower spine and my scores were worse in my hip .  I’m so disappointed that I did not have significant improvement in my osteoporosis especially since the treatment was so uncomfortable and so expensive. I just hope that I don’t develop cancer or kidney problems from using this drug.	2	September 12, 2019	53

Abaloparatide (Subcutaneous)		This prescription has made me very tired.  All I wanted to do is sleep it has also caused wheezing when I was on for 3 days in a row  then off every other day the wheezing and breathing got better.  Then instructed to go back on every day  and by  day 3 wheezing coughing and shortness of breath   took myself off completely at day 3 and it's been 3 weeks and still tired and coughing with shortness of breath	1	March 12, 2018	11
Abatacept	Orencia (abatacept) for Rheumatoid Arthritis	I have really bad rheumatoid arthritis that I had to get a hip replacement at 26! After having my daughter I went into a full on flare that I became crippled. Nothing was helping and I thought my life was over. But, they had me try Orencia and (although it took 3 months to kick in) it changed my life. I was finally able to carry my daughter and walk with her. I’ve been taking it for about 5 years. There are always going to be bad and good reviews. It just depends on your body.	10	March 30, 2021	3
Abatacept	Orencia (abatacept) for Rheumatoid Arthritis	I was on Enbrel for over 15 years for RA. Shortly after I started on it I told my rheumatologist it was a miracle drug. I still had flares but the severe pain I had felt every day was pretty much gone. Then, after so many years, the pain started returning. My current rheumatologist switched me to Humira. After a month it seemed to be helping. But I was having nausea and a continuous headache with occasional dizziness. It was so bad I asked my rheumatologist to switch me to something else. She then put me on Orencia. I've been on it for 6 weeks but the pain I had before going on Humira has returned. And I also have nasal congestion 24/7. I'll give the Orencia a few more weeks, until my next appointment with my rheumatologist, and if the pain and congestion isn't any better, I'll see what she wants to do. As a side note, I've also been taking methotrexate for 15 years.	4	January 7, 2021	5
Abatacept	Orencia (abatacept) for Rheumatoid Arthritis	I have been in abatacept for around two years but even though inflammatory markers are normal, I still feel pain all over, like a flare, I also have other things that are wrong  with me.   My white cells and platelets were above normal last time, which concerns me as I had a  blood clot 10 years ago in my lung. I have a lot of pain all over and I haven't a clue what it could be. Is it possible to have normal inflammatory marker and be still hurting? Thanks.	6	December 28, 2020	3
Abatacept	Orencia (abatacept) for Rheumatoid Arthritis	This Orencia took about four months to work for my RA. I have zero pain and good mobility.Been taking it for a year and am 71 years old.	8	July 27, 2020	32
Abatacept	Orencia (abatacept) for Rheumatoid Arthritis	This drug has been a great. Humira made me break out in a huge hot rash, and Leuflonamide (Arabs) made over half of my hair fall out and a full body rash for over 6 months with NO relief. While Arabs made my RA symptoms completely disappear, the side effects as a 35 yr old female were unacceptable. Orencia has very literally changed my life. I live in northern MN and with certain climate changes I still have minor joint stiffness, I am completely out of pain and the stiffness is 100 x’s better than what it was. I’m so very grateful for this drug.	10	July 3, 2020	31
Abatacept	Orencia (abatacept) for Psoriatic Arthritis	Orencia took about three months for the full benefit to kick in. Been on it for nine months now with great joint movement. Hope this keeps up - cost about six thousand a month which insurance pays. Yes - I am fortunate,	8	April 28, 2020	14

Abatacept	Orencia (abatacept) for Rheumatoid Arthritis	The best drug I have been on!  It gave me my life back!	10	February 27, 2020	28
Abatacept	Orencia (abatacept) for Rheumatoid Arthritis	Worked great for 9 months. (moderate-severe with positive RA factor) Went off this for around three weeks due to a mix-up with co-pay. Now, two straight weeks of stomach rumbling and diarrhea. Probiotics, pepto-bismo nothing is helping. This is the only RA med that has worked for me, so I really hope my doctor can get me over this. I am on a copay plan through an assistance fund and they pay what Medicare/Anthem doesn't cover $1500/mth. Before Orencia I was unable to function, so I'm very thankful because it gave me some of my life back.	7	February 6, 2020	32
Abatacept	Orencia (abatacept) for Rheumatoid Arthritis	Brilliant drug.	10	November 11, 2019	16
Abatacept	Orencia (abatacept) for Rheumatoid Arthritis	Garbage! Like every biologic out there. They all suck. They all carry horrible side effects including death. Cancer, infectious, etc. I've tried just about every biologic out there including Humira, Enbrel, Cimzia...They all quit working within 6 months.  I'm convinced that Orencia caused me severe food sensitivities. There's no other explanation form my severe food sensitivities. I get inflammation from a bunch of foods. Kale, spinach , nuts, beans, rice, all animal protein which is crazy. My list of foods that cause me inflammation immediately upon eating them is crazy and I didn't have that problem before starting Orencia about 7 years ago. My rheumatologist doesn't believe me. It's very frustrating. It's been 7 years since I started Orencia and my food sensitivities have gotten worse. I'm going to report it to the FDA as a side effect. I just hope they come up with a cure ASAP. Enough bandaids that cause cancer and infections..We need a cure.	2	September 9, 2019	37
Abatacept	Orencia (abatacept) for Rheumatoid Arthritis	I am a 49 year old male. I was diagnosed with RA in 1997. I was on Humira for 10 years, which helped greatly but the side effects began showing so I was forced to stop. I was off all RA meds for a couple of years and my condition began deteriorating again. I went on Orencia IV drip. I began showing almost all of the side effects listed about a month after my first dose. It was slowly poisoning me. I was sick all the time and showing severe symptoms; Exhaustion, night sweats, back pain, migraines for 8 days straight, diarrhea, nausea and a level of discomfort I've never felt. It's an awful medicine with crippling side effects. It is important to note that the side effects were worse than the RA itself and my condition is moderate to severe. My suggestion is to avoid this medication at all cost. I was put on a anti nausea pill that is used for chemo patients. If you do some research you will find that 25% of the people on Orencia have a bad experience.	1	May 15, 2019	52
Abatacept	Orencia (abatacept) for Rheumatoid Arthritis	I have ever been on abatacept and after 13 weeks it hasn't had any effect. I was on rituximab with no result either, am I a lost cause?

Abatacept	Orencia (abatacept) for Rheumatoid Arthritis	This medication made sense to me. Why not try something that will block the entire inflammatory cascade over just one inflammatory protein like TNFa ?  All other Meds ( 5 others) were fails for me due to either no response or a severe reaction... Orencia was the answer to my prayers ... For me , it did take about 6 months to see elimination of joint inflammation... and about 9 months for Full effect of this drug. My advice is to be patient with these medications and just hang in there ...eventually, you will hit the right drug for you .  I have my life back now.  So grateful.	9	February 5, 2019	88
Abatacept	Orencia (abatacept) for Rheumatoid Arthritis	"Could only tolerate 4 infusions over a 2 month period. Managed the extreme fatigue, but the canker sores (mouth ulcers) were debilitating. Nothing I tried helped from 2 docs, (Rheumatologist and Dentist) 2 pharmacists. Difficulty talking, eating and sleeping. At the worst stage, I had terrible ear pain (ear aches), PCP said my ears were ""congested"" and always on the side of 6 - 8 canker sores on my tongue. Do not know next steps. Doc does not believe canker sores are caused by Orencia......never had anything like this in my life."	1	November 11, 2018	45
Abatacept	Orencia (abatacept) for Rheumatoid Arthritis	The first biologic I was put on was Enbrel and within 4 weeks, I was experiencing liver failure! So I went back on my oral meds for 2 more years. My new Rheumatologist prescribed Orencia and I have been on it for 3 years. It has given me back my freedom! I have had RA for 18 years and nothing worked this well!	10	October 18, 2018	73
Abatacept	Orencia (abatacept) for Rheumatoid Arthritis	I took this medication for 2 years! 2 years my Rheumatologist forced me to stay on this nothing medication with obvious continuous flare, and damage. I think 1 good year of giving a medication a go is sufficient, but this useless Rheumatologist refused to try something else. In the meantime....my hands have obvious irreversible damage, swollen, hurt, and I require pain pills to survive. This medication is useless.	1	October 10, 2018	26
Abatacept	Orencia (abatacept) for Rheumatoid Arthritis	This medication has worked spectacularly well for me.  I used to be on a cocktail including Humira, MTX, steroids and NSAIDS. I changed my diet and tried to go au natural for a few years...it worked for a while, but in my stubbornness, I experienced some joint damage.  So I was highly inflamed when I started the Orencia.  My rheumy and I picked this med because while on Humira, I was sick more than I was well.  Orencia has the reputation for causing less illness.  After five months, my inflammation has significantly decreased and I haven't had even a sniffle.  That said, any medication has a higher potential to work for you if you are eating an anti-inflammatory diet and making sure you are not vitamin/mineral deficient.  Try an elimination diet so you can truly know what foods bother you. Most people aren't in tune enough with their bodies to know when a food is making their joints worse.  An elimination diet is key to getting in touch with your body and its response to food.	10	October 10, 2018	86

Abatacept	Orencia (abatacept) for Rheumatoid Arthritis	Been on Orencia 8 years. Started with infusions, switched to injections. Have not seen any improvement, but Dr. insists it's working because my inflammation markers are normal. My orthopedic doesn't agree though, because he continues to see more joint damage every time I see him. And if my inflammation markers are normal, why is there pain and swelling every day?	2	May 22, 2018	52
Abatacept	Orencia (abatacept) for Rheumatoid Arthritis	Orencia  worked a little maybe taking the pain down from 8 to 6 but it did not get rid of the  sacroiliac joint (SI) joint pain I had ever, so I went on to try another medicine from my rheumatologist.	1	April 25, 2018	14

Abatacept	Orencia (abatacept) for Rheumatoid Arthritis	I had had success with Actemra, but at the 11 month mark, I had a heart attack and an upper GI bleed, both believed to be caused by the Actemra.  So, we changed to Orencia, primarily because it has a lower incidence of side effects.  It did take 5-1/2 months for the Orencia to start working, but it is now working well, and I feel like it continues to improve.  I do take it in combination with methotrexate.  I have not had any side effects.  I am very pleased by how much Orencia has helped me.	9	February 9, 2018	51
Abatacept	Orencia (abatacept) for Rheumatoid Arthritis	Unfortunately Orencia did not work for me. I waited six months to see if it would work. It did nothing for me, but at least I didn’t have any side effects from it. I wish they could come up with a test to figure out what medication will work for who. It’s terrible wasting time waiting for something that may never happen.		November 19, 2017	40
Abatacept	Orencia (abatacept) for Rheumatoid Arthritis	I had the worse experience with this Orencia medicine. I kept waiting for the six months that  they said it takes to work. In the process, I got worse than ever . It not only didn't work but made me worse. I was so mad that I waited so long  in vain. I will never try another medication that supposedly take that long to work.	1	October 16, 2017	20
Abatacept	Orencia (abatacept) for Rheumatoid Arthritis	I have been on Orencia for 3.5 years and diagnosed 4 years ago. I am so thankful that I responded so well to this medication. Orencia was the first medication and hopefully, the last. Since my first infusion, in 2013, and the symptoms were finally being held at bay, I have not had any issues to date. I, whole heartily, 100% recommend Orecina. It saved my life and gave me my life back. I hope it'll do the same for you.	10	September 29, 2017	69
Abatacept	Orencia (abatacept) for Rheumatoid Arthritis	I've been doing the infusion for three months now. It hasn't improved any of my symptoms at all. Day of infusion I get severe low back/hip pain & I'm exhausted. The two days following I sleep a lot & feel awful.	3	June 20, 2017	34

Abemaciclib	Verzenio (abemaciclib)	I have been on Verzenio for 14 months after 2 months is shrank my tumor by 60% and after 12 month bone mets were almost gone 12 month pet scan showed no active cancer cells.	10	September 20, 2020	16
Abemaciclib	Verzenio (abemaciclib)	This drug Verzenio shrank my tumour in my sternum a lot.  I have now had it successfully removed.	9	August 27, 2020	11
Abemaciclib	Verzenio (abemaciclib)	Verzenio has worked after my wife’s initial treatment failed and  her cancer returned.    She had some initial diarrhea, but, our doctor adjusted dose and now all Is going good.	10	February 19, 2020	22
Abilify	Autism	This really helped my rage/irritability but not possible to continue taking due to severe weight gain. I was put on it when I was 12 and it completely halted my metabolism. I was 75lbs when I started it and within 2 months I was 140lbs. I went from a double zero size to a size 13 in just 8 weeks. I no joke could gain weight from eating an apple. I have stretch marks and extra skin to this day (12 years later) from it. I got off it as soon as we switched drs (my dr at the time refused).	3	April 15, 2021	1
Abilify	Agitated State	I’ve been dealing with anger/mood issues. My psychiatrist put me on 5mg Abilify. I took it last night for the first time. I woke up puking, and having diarrhea. I have had a dizzy spell, if I get up. My heart will race. It was recommended to take before bedtime. But, I’ve been up all night. Wasn’t a pleasant experience.	2	April 9, 2021	4
Abilify	Depression	I've had abilify added to my antidepressants for several years now and it really helps.  This month it was suggested I try stopping the abilify and I've slowly become terribly depressed again.  Still on my antidepressants but sad, tearful, like a lonely and lost soul.  I’m going to restart it ASAP along with my antidepressants.	9	April 9, 2021	9
Abilify	Depression	I took Abilify 10mg for several years.  It really helped me stabilize my moods and get my depression under control and took away a to of my urges of self harming behaviors. I have found Abilify much more helpful than any other traditional SSRI/antidepressant I have tried in the past like Lexapro, Prozac, and Zoloft. None of those medications really made a significant impact. The reason I stopped taking Abilify is because of the weight gain.  Personally, antipsychotic medications have always cause weight gain for me.  I gained about 50 pounds while on Abilify. I switched to 50mg Lamictal and have started losing some of the weight.  Abilify can really be life changing, but you just have to be aware of the possible side effects.	7	April 8, 2021	4
Abilify	Depression	Truly life saving.  Tortured by intrusive ruminating depressive and anxious thinking.  Abilify 5mg is the magic bullet that I didn’t think existed.  Return of calm peace of mind.  Off all other meds.  No side effects.	10	April 3, 2021	24
Abilify	Major Depressive Disorder	I was suicidal from the age of 10 till the age of 45 years of age. I had a deep, constant desire to die, and nothing was helping them. I also suffered from major depression, borderline personality disorder, general anxiety disorder and binge eating. My doctor was at a loss of what to try. Finally after years of suffering I stopped having suicidal ideation now that I a on Abilify! I am now 47 years old. I am so glad my doctor put me on this drug. It saved my life.	10	April 3, 2021	2
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	I was prescribed 2mg of Abilify to take for being diagnosed with bipolar depression. I started with half the tablet in the morning and omg! I felt sleepy the first day and somewhat disoriented. I felt that anxious feeling you get with new meds hours later. At night, lights were so bright to me and it also gave me insomnia. Second and third days were worse with side effects. I almost dialled 911. I was perspiring, felt lightheaded and extremely weak. It made me feel paranoid. Had a panic attack and the rest of the day, I felt as if I drank 6 cups of coffee. Never again! Bye Abilify!	1	April 1, 2021	3
Abilify	Autism	This type of medication is not for autism. It was ok for a month whilst my son was distracted by the side effects. He then became more aggressive and argumentative and was hyperactive. He also developed OCD. Risperidone did not work either and he had tics on it.	1	March 26, 2021	2
Abilify	Schizophrenia	This drug is terrible.It keeps me up at night, wide awake! I had the depot injection, now it will not let me sleep for a month. I have been on it for 9 days, counting down the days. What can help with sleep? I tried quetiapine.it didn't work. I don't even know if my dr will stop this injection. Fingers crossed, he will.in 21 days. Don't take the injection form if you have a choice .For me,I don't have a choice.	1	March 25, 2021	1
Abilify	Depression	I have been having pretty bad depression and severe lack of motivation for a while. I have failed many antidepressants. I recently switch to Effexor XR 75mg which did provide some relief for both depression & anxiety. I tried slightly increasing the dose but it made me feel a bit wired, so I stayed at 75mg.  I don’t like the idea of taking an antipsychotic daily but I also couldn’t live with the way I was feeling and the life style it brought. I started Abilify  and have been taking 2.5mg at night for a week (half a 5mg tab) along with the Effexor. It has definitely provided additional relief from depression. Other psych meds I take are Klonopin 1mg two to three times a day as needed, Remeron 30mg and Melatonin gummies 5mg for sleep as well as Seroquel 50-100mg only if needed for sleep, and Adderall 10mg as needed for ADD.	9	March 24, 2021	6
Abilify	Schizophrenia	I've been on Abilify for about five days. And I noticed a big change. I'm not having any intrusive/destruction thoughts. I'm not hearing voices. Even my dreams have gotten better. So, I WOULD DEF RECOMMEND!	10	March 11, 2021	14
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	Made me feel like complete rubbish for a year.  It was hard to do anything.  All I wanted to do was eat and sleep.	1	March 9, 2021	7
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	I've been on Abilify for 7 months now, 15mg. Initially for the first month I felt restless but full of energy. I had mild nausea that made me loose 7lbs. Then over time these symptoms disappeared and I experienced calmness. No paranoia anymore and my negative thoughts have been reduced dramatically. So did my manic episodes and my depression, So I’m now stable. However I've put on 18lbs even with exercising everyday I can’t seem to shift the weight! But the good over rides the bad. I recommend this medication for bpd and Bipolar it’s changed my life	9	March 6, 2021	10
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	Abilify has changed my life. I’m a healthy 23 year old who suffers from bdp (bipolar disorder) and eating disorders.  My moods are stable & can finally bring myself to eat again. If you're skeptical, don’t be. This will change your life like it has mine. No nasty side effects except weird vivid dreams but I’ll take that over the bpd and day!	10	March 4, 2021	1
Abilify	Schizoaffective Disorder	I was on Abilify for 11 years and noticed that it made my mind clearer but numb. I was then taken off the medication on medical advice which led to 2 arrests and being sectioned. I’m back on Abilify but I’m very very concerned about the long term effects of this medication.	3	February 28, 2021	2
Abilify	Schizoaffective Disorder	This drug works for the paranoia and hallucinations. It helps me organize my thoughts and not forget everything I'm doing when I walk into another room. I lost 20lb on this drug, but I was on a higher dose of Seroquel before...so not sure if I just lost weight because I came off the higher dose of seroquel. Now I weigh 118lb at 5'3, instead of 130-140lb. It's great other than some restlessness. Push through the initial restlessness, it gets better.	9	February 27, 2021	2
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	I'm 40 year old, never took drugs before.  I went on 5mg abilify and 2mg Zoloft after my life turned into a nightmare  (mom died, jail, divorce, lost custody of kid, no job, etc) Deep depression and anxiety, Doc gave ability with 2mg Zoloft. Gained 60lb in first 6 months. 5’3” from 160 to 220 lbs. with CBT therapist to support me, I eventually found a job:  I took abilify 5mg for the 2 years and sometimes 10 mg to deal with job stress. Abilify stabilized my mood and helped me focus on job and not dwell on pain and hurt of the nightmare years personal life — it kept my thoughts from spinning me into a deep depression. Was able to socialize. Was 60 lbs overweight with BMI of 34. After one year and wearing off, doc switch me to vraylar.  Vraylar made me more of an emotionally stable rock, not too high or low, headache, no snack craving and eating  much less. After few months, got my doc approval to quit all meds... I lost 30 lbs easily, but had to spend 6 months in gym class to lose rest of 30 lbs.	9	February 23, 2021	1
Abilify	Depression	well, I am a 26 year old female, and I had a life saving kidney transplant on December 11th 2018. after spending 2.5 years on dialysis. i developed severe anxiety during the start of dialysis. post TX i am beyond happy. but anxiety and depression increased ive tried so many different medications for my anxiety and depression that didnt work. 1 year ago almost my doctor put me on 90 mg of cymbalta and it worked! But anxiety and depression started creeping out some more slowly and I just couldn't handle how I was feeling especially being a mother to a 6 year old boy. 2 weeks ago my doctor recommended Abilify at a very low dose to add on with my Cymbalta in which I was iffy about it and gave it some time to think about if I wanted to take it. Today is my third day taking this medication and I'm on a minimal dose at 1mg. I have been taking it in the morning and yesterday... I noticed a major positive difference within myself. I felt increasingly energized, I felt more motivated.	10	February 21, 2021	8
Abilify	Depression	Well I just started abilify last night 1mg and have yet to notice anything  I'll keep an update		February 20, 2021	3
Abilify	Depression	Abilify is a strange one. I had been on Effexor for a couple years with very slight mood improvement only. Added Abilify for 8 months. Physiologically I felt super energized, barely slept but was never tired. Tremendously productive- getting up at 4am to go running, then coming home to mark papers until I had to go to work at 730am.  Side effects were disturbing though:  compulsive swallowing, eyelids that wouldn’t open fully, severe hand tremors - couldn’t eat in front of coworkers because shaking was so bad. No weight gain or loss.  But, zero effect on mood.  I stayed on it simply because I liked being so productive.  But it didn’t help my depression all, so I abandoned it.  The shaking lingered for months after but eventually went away.	2	February 14, 2021	5
Abilify	Agitated State	I take 2.5mg of Abilify.  Abilify is my miracle drug. I have struggled with anxiety my entire life, and have PTSD. I used to struggle with feeling rage, intrusive thoughts that I just couldn’t shake and general overwhelming  anxiety. Tried and quit at least ten other meds before finding this one.   I know it works because if I accidentally forget a dose one day my anxiety is back in full force for 2-3 days after. Once it’s back in my system I’m fine again.   I haven’t had any noticeable side effects. I take trazodone and melatonin for sleep so I have no problems sleeping, and I have been intentionally losing weight by counting calories with no problem.   I quit a different med that was making my hair thin before starting this, and my hair has all come back on Abilify.   I have a prescription for a benzo for anxiety as needed, but I don’t need it anymore.	10	February 11, 2021	9
Abilify	Autism	I take it with Lexapro, and it’s been amazing for my depression and irritability. I feel better than I have in years. The only side effects I don’t care for is the insomnia/waking up in the middle of the night.	7	February 11, 2021	4
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	On the first day of abilify I experienced stabilization. My mood was stable after two weeks on Abilify and I have not experienced any side effects. I do not experience weight gain on Abilify which is a blessing. I notice that my mood is friendlier and more positive. I started eating more fruits and vegetables and I maintain a healthy diet on Abilify. I only have positive things to say about Abilify. Please give this medication a try it’ll change your life for the better.	10	February 11, 2021	8
Abilify	Depression	This is a miracle drug for me. I have been on so many antidepressants over the years for major anxiety and depression with no relief.  Within a day or two of Abilify, I feel human again. I've been on it for about 8 years and my dosage is between 2 to 4 mg. I have gained a lot of weight but I'll take it over the nightmarish way I feel when I don't. No side effects other than the weight gain. I also have found that the brand name works much better for me.	10	February 10, 2021	4
Abilify	Depression	I've been on Abilify Maintena 10mg for 4 months and I asked to be taken off the drug a week ago. It didn't help with my depression, I am emotionally numb now, still have an increased appetite and no energy. I used to be incredibly active. I don't know how much longer it will take for the side effects to disappear. Do not take his drug if you have the same symptoms.	1	February 10, 2021	7
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	First I’m going to say that I’ve never took medication in my life. I am currently 20 years old. I took a Abilify tablet for bipolar disorder. I was told to take it at night so I did. I woke up in the morning and my chest was in so much pain. My boyfriends mother checked my heartbeat with a stethoscope and my heart was fluttering after every 10 beats or so. I went to the ER, they said nothing was wrong. lol? days later it started to feel like my heartbeat would pause then start back up. The pain is currently on the left side of my chest above my breast and shoulder blade. I really don’t know what to do..? I’m too afraid to go to the doctors.	1	February 10, 2021	2
Abilify	Major Depressive Disorder	I was on Abilify 2mg 12/18-02/19, along with 20mg of Lexapro. First 10 days, I felt euphoric, energetic, motivated, excited about life.  Well, it came to a screeching halt. I was fidgety, pacing back & forth, would sit & wiggle my feet & legs, was gaining weight, wasn't sleeping & thought I was going crazy. I continued to take it for another 6 weeks to give it a chance. That was a mistake. It was all I could do to make it through a whole workday. I thought I was going out of my mind. I have been off it for 2 years & still have mild side effects, still fidgety, have restless feet & legs, & don't sleep much. As for depression, I feel I was better off before Abilify than now. I appreciate that it has been a wonderful drug for many but where there are so many uncertainties of its effects, I would research it thoroughly before taking it. I don't think most doctors, including psychiatrists, have the slightest clue of how horrible this drug is for most. I would never recommend it to anyone.	1	February 9, 2021	10
Abilify	Major Depressive Disorder	Was prescribed Abilify to help 'boost' my antidepressants. Have been on it for almost two years. Caused me to gain 50 pounds in 3 months and even with exercise and dieting have been unable to lose the weight. Also causes very vivid dreams and at higher doses causes feelings of anxiety and paranoia. I strongly suggest you take a genetic test to make sure this medication will work for you before you take this drug	2	February 9, 2021	5
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	I have always been against taking medication,  although I have epilepsy and have to. I was very weary of starting this one,  or any other mood stabilizer. Now that I have been taking it for two weeks, I'm so glad I did. It was like walking out of a dark room and back into the light of day. I use to just go about my daily activities with dread. Now I am excited to be a part of society again. I have gotten back in contact with old friends don't experience hardly any social anxiety and have so much energy. Thank you abilify	8	February 6, 2021	8
Abilify	Depression	For me Abilify was a godsend. Sometimes I get a bit hypomanic, but that still beats the soul-crushing depression snd anxiety.	8	February 5, 2021	9
Abilify	Agitated State	The side effects are bad at first - do not take Abilify at night! My feet were erratic starting out and I had a hard time sleeping because I took it at night. Another side effect: Weight gain does occur! But, this is not because the pill has calories (one review said) or because it gives you munchies (another review said). It simply changes the way your body stores leptin and processes food. Adding in slight exercise, or reducing your calories with healthier foods might help - or if you are lucky, it might not affect you at all. I did not notice the weight gain effects on the 5 mg, but I did on the 10 mg. I have gained three pounds in one week. Personally, the weight is not something I can handle, so I will be going back to 5 mg because that worked just fine for me.   It might take some experimenting but try it first (always start with a low dose).	7	February 5, 2021	5
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	Is this trash or is this trash? This made me so sleepy and tired! It made me hungry all the time! A useless medication for me! I got off of it! I am much better off without it. Other than it making me sleepy and hungry I had no other side effects. It did nothing for my bipolar disorder!	1	February 2, 2021	2
Abilify	Schizoaffective Disorder	My doctor misdiagnosed me with schizo-affective disorder even with an ADHD diagnosis as a child, but I figured I'd try it anyway because hey, maybe they got it wrong back then. So I took Abilify and by the end of week three, I damn near went psychotic and was suicidal because of it. This is the single worst drug I've ever had the displeasure of taking. I'm not saying it doesn't work but if you get misdiagnosed, which happens often enough, you're going to have a very bad time.	1	February 1, 2021	1
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	Taking Abilify as a replacement of Olanzapine, not a miracle drug, but helps mitigating paranoia and hypomania	8	January 30, 2021	3
Abilify	Major Depressive Disorder	I was prescribed Ambilify for MDD, it was added to my Citalopram.  I noticed a positive difference within 4 days.  After a few weeks on it I felt even better, had energy & motivation for the first time in years.  I slept better and was ready to get out of bed in the the morning.  However, within 3 months of taking this I gained almost 20lbs.  I had a bit of a weight problem before this so I was of course really freaked out.  My doctor told me it wasn't the Ambilify, it was my eating habits, I knew different but I loved how I felt so I kept taking it. Fast forward 6 months, I've gained 38lbs, I hate the way I look so much I won't leave my house and my depression returned.  I stopped taking it slowly, I've lost my energy and physical things are twice as hard because of my weight.    I'm seriously disappointed to have to stop taking something that helped me so much because of the extreme weight gain.	7	January 30, 2021	5
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	Been diagnosed 18 years ago with Bipolar ...OCD. panic an anxiety disorder.  I've been on antidepressants since then then a few months ago it got worse 15 panicked attacks every single night an I walked floors all night long. Every night still sleep sitting up all night. I dose off an on, all night. I've suffered all my life feeling different since I was old enough to remember  say 5 yrs old and I'm 49 now. I would like share my experience  to help someone else, since I've  always been paranoid and avoid people. I always felt shy an awkward and I guess since my new blue pill Abilify I feel so much better. After taking my first pill my racing thoughts disappeared and my moods got better and I finally feel normal.  Everything seems so enjoyable now it saved my mental well being ...	10	January 28, 2021	20
Abilify	Depression	I've been taking this along with Clonidine for a month and they increased Abilify to 5mg. Once this happened, after a bit I've started to get insomnia, restlessness/anxiousness, nausea, appetite change (not hungry). I chose to go off it myself since my psych insisted I stay on, but I couldn't keep torturing myself like this. Hopefully my body returns to normal, when I could sleep and eat without worries.	2	January 26, 2021	4
Abilify	Schizophrenia	Got rid of the hallucinations and auditory voices, mostly... Paranoia still pretty bad	5	January 26, 2021	7
Abilify	Agitated State	"My son was prescribed Abilify for ""aggressive"" behavior at age 6. It didn't really change his behavior. Within a year he began showing symptoms of ADHD, despite no signs before starting the med. Is the restlessness really ADHD, or is it akathisia caused by the med? He also became compulsive on Abilify, which I learned only recently is a known side-effect of the medication. His BMI is now borderline obese, and his metabolic labs are all elevated. I'm now tapering him off of it after more than 3 years. I've noticed a reduction in his compulsive and thrill seeking behavior, though he still can't sit still for the life of him. Hopefully those withdrawl side-effects will subside with time. If a doctor recommends your child take a mood-stabilizer, remember that a calm parent is the best mood-stabilizer for a child. This stuff isn't FDA approved for use in children for a reason. I'm not anti-medication and I'm sure this med works for some people, but this med did not work for him."	1	January 25, 2021	4
Abilify	Schizoaffective Disorder	Was prescribed this from my Pdoc. Took my scheduled doses for two days and next thing I was in the hospital. Extreme heart rate and blood pressure through the roof. Made me extremely manic and irritable. It's been six years since I have taken it and still have some effects. Thought process has changed dramatically since the episode and lost the ability to think and problem solve. I have lost most short term memory as well as some longterm. My once creative side before taking (musically, art) is now completely gone. Many tests later doctors still cannot find what the problem is, no evidence of brain damage but they do believe something was altered in my brain. Happy for anyone that can take this medication without side effect but if you get prescribed ask about these side effects. This has impacted my life drastically and since then I cannot take any medications. I'll get extremely agitated taking pills and anxiety through the roof.	1	January 25, 2021	4
Abilify	Depression	Abilify definitely helped with anxiety and depression during the 5+ years I took it, but I gained nearly 100 lbs during that time. When I discontinued use, my weight immediately stabilized and has started slowly decreasing. Anxiety and depression have unfortunately also started creeping back in.	3	January 17, 2021	8
Abilify	Agitated State	I was put on this many years ago for a nervous breakdown and it started to help almost instantly. It was a good add on to my anti depressants at the time. I was literally only on it two weeks and doc decided I didn't need it anymore. It worked a lot better than any other things I've been on over the years. No side effects	8	January 15, 2021	8
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	Took one dose & felt more agitated. It also has given me bad diarrhea. Feels like I’m prepping for a colonoscopy. My brain felt foggy, I was dizzy and sluggish during the day. NO THANK YOU!	1	January 14, 2021	3
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	Absolutely amazing has changed my life I absolutely love this medication.  It helped with my anxiety, depression, has helped with all around social anxiety, very highly recommended. I got to put down three other medications just to take this one pill a day awesome.	10	January 5, 2021	21
Abilify	Autism	My son was prescribed Abilify years ago on a low dosage and it seemed to help him a lot. He had some weight gain but not much. As he got older and bigger he started having issues again and he was taken off Abilify and put on Risperidone. It was a complete disaster and things got bad really, really fast. Eventually he was put back on Abilify at a higher dosage and taken off Risperidone and things are much better. I recommend Abilify over Risperidone any day for autism.		December 31, 2020	16
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	I took abilify for about two months after zyprexa was making me incredibly sleepy and hungry all the time. After a few weeks I became unbearably anxious and restless in a way I'd never experienced before and have never experienced since. Switched to geodon because I couldn't tolerate the extreme anxiety anymore and Geodon dose the trick. Didn't become manic so I guess it worked tho.	3	December 30, 2020	1
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	I took trileptal by itself for a long time. That helped at first but I never quite felt normal. I then hit a stressful point in my life and began having A LOT of mania and depression. I started neglecting my meds, feeling hopeless. My Dr. then suggested I take abilify 5 mg in addition to the trileptal. After seeing reviews about weight gain, increased mania, etc. I was wary about trying it but I decided to. I have not gained any weight from the med (I am 5’4 115lbs young female). The first few days I was switching rapidly between manic and depressed and had a lot of insomnia. However after about 3-4 days I noticed for the first time in 5 years I feel like myself again. I haven’t been this levelled and happy in so long. I rarely have depressive or manic episodes which is something I thought was impossible. Definitely give this a try and don’t be discouraged by the first few days. It’s so worth it.	10	December 29, 2020	17
Abilify	Schizophrenia	After one yea on low dose developed Type 2 Diabetes, 5 weeks ago.	8	December 28, 2020	5
Abilify	Schizoaffective Disorder	Terrible drug. Caused me to have seizures within two months of taking it. Discontinued it immediately.	1	December 28, 2020	2
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	I used to take Abilify for management of bipolar disorder, this medication was personally horrible in my treatment. It made my mood swings worse and I became very aggressive. I began to isolate myself . Thank goodness I am off of this medication.  My husband had a similar reaction to it almost instantly.	1	December 16, 2020	6
Abilify	Major Depressive Disorder	Abilify was THE game changer for me.   I've struggled with major Depression since childhood, and had taken pretty much every other drug out there (for 20+ years) before this was prescribed in a very low dose to augment another med I'd already been taking.   I felt NORMAL for the first time in my life.  No, didn't make me ecstatically happy--it made me feel that life was worth living for.    Unfortunately, it didn't help with my anxiety, so I eventually switched to another med in order to take only 1 med, not 3.  It was expensive but so worth it.  No side effects whatsoever (2 mg dose)	10	December 14, 2020	20
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	This was one of the worst medications I’ve ever tried. I have bipolar 2 with rapid cycling and this medication literally made me out of it. I could barely gather thoughts. I felt dumb as a rock and couldn’t focus. I also felt so agitated that it took all my energy to survive the day. It made me hungry but did nothing for depression or hypomania. My eyeballs felt like they were rolling around and I could have just stared at a white wall. Stopping it was like a dream. I took it for a few months. Worst med ever. Totally net negative. Beware if you have my combo of bipolar.	1	December 12, 2020	12
Abilify	Schizoaffective Disorder	The side affects are not worth the risk of even trying this medication.	1	December 10, 2020	2
Abilify	Schizophrenia	I have taken Abilify for 10 years for schizophrenia.  It has been a wonder drug in some aspects because it keeps my schizophrenia at bay.  Before I started taking it I was losing my mind, thought “people” were after me, heard thoughts and saw visions.  Basically I was not functional and couldn’t hold a job.  All of this has gone away over the years and now I am a functioning adult.  It regulates my sleep and moods, too.    The side effects are minimal but noticeable.  I developed type 2 diabetes even though I maintain a regular exercise schedule and eat right.  Also, I have no sex drive and it kind of screws up your all of your sexual functions.    Also, beware of these medications and take them only if you have to have them.  I developed something called tardive akathisia when I tried to stop taking Abilify.  It is an absolutely horrible side effect caused by your brain trying to return to the way it originally worked and it is truly awful. Look it up!	8	December 1, 2020	12
Abilify	Agitated State	I was recently  prescribed  abilify (the generic) during  COVID. I have PTSD BPD and depression  so with  everything  going  on it has made me insane.  I had rage outbursts and would  want to hit people, not to mention the stress and lockdown.  Everytime  I left the house  there's signs and masks everywhere- anyways I needed a change.  I tried Abilify I'm on 5mg now, I found  it actually  increased my appetite,  I gained at least  10 lbs which  I'm not fond of, but I've been  eating  again.  I find it has worked great  as far as a mood stabilizer I've only had 1 panic attack since being on it. The first few weeks  I was really  agitated and paranoid  though. If I don't take it at the exact time everyday I feel  sick.  Overall it does help with my mood and rage so I'll stay on it. I don't like the always  having  to move,  its nice  at work  but not if I ever want to relax	7	December 1, 2020	10
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	I suffer some depression, some OCD traits and may be mildly Bipolar. I take Zoloft which hugely helped my mood swings. Lately my mind has been at great unrest......consumed by worry....unable to focus. Fatigue set in and I was tired all the time....even after a good nights sleep. My Dr put me on Abilify 2mg once daily. I thought to myself.....How will such a tiny little pill help? Well I am so IMPRESSED!!!!! The brain fog and worry is gone. I wake up early every morning with energy that lasts all day long! I would totally recommend Abilify!	10	November 28, 2020	17
Abilify	Schizophrenia	I was abilify for Constantly thinking disorder, it made me gain a lot of weight I have a lot of thoughts medicine did nothing to stop them. Feel like it just created more anxiety and akathesia.	1	November 28, 2020	4
Abilify	Schizoaffective Disorder	I’ve been taking Abilify for years, I had to restart it about a month ago after being off of it for about four months. I started getting a really terrible appetite where I just wanted to keep on eating, I think I’ve gained a bit of weight while on it. I have WAY too much energy and have found I’ve become a bit impulsive. Although, any hallucinations I used to have, have lessened quite a bit so that’s a plus! I feel like the longer you’re on it, the less bad side effects you feel. If you’re feeling too energized and like the constantly need to move, it may be a thing called Akathisia; a need to always be doing something or a mental unrest. Any anger I used to have, has lessened or is gone pretty much. I do feel pretty spaced out a lot and very forgetful thought and not myself but at least the psychotic symptoms I had have lessened.	8	November 27, 2020	7
Abilify	Depression	"I was put on Abilify and it made me feel very strange. I went off it after a few days and was very glad I did. My daughter, who also suffers from depression was put on it and she went from weighing 120 pounds (at 5'6"") and gained over 100 pounds in 8-9 months. During that time she voluntarily went into the hospital for suicide ideation. I could hardly recognize her personality and was appalled to see her so morbidly obese when I saw her for the first time when I visited her to pick her up from the hospital once she was released. She looked like a zombie - pale, dark shadows under her eyes - and she was only 26 years old at the time. She went off it and it took her a long time getting her weight down at a stable 150 pounds. Her poor body went through a really hard time, not to mention the bad effect it had on her mind. AWFUL!!"	1	November 17, 2020	29
Abilify	Schizophrenia	My son is diagnose with schizophrenia in middle school his first medication was Risperdol which worked for a small amount of time however I think he outgrew it or the dosage weaken against the imbalance it took some dramatic changes before they changed his medications however when given abilify which is what he is currently taking I see vast and major improvement it took on a slow gradual change at first however now it is very noticeable that this abilfy is having a positive effect thus far on my son abilify  to think with calm mind and little to no agitation at all. IF this medication proves to be effective for a long period I would assume he may on down the road only need to adjust the dosage not now however. I would give it from my personal experience as a mother with a son who currently taking  a definite 8 out of 10 thus far.	8	October 21, 2020	20
Abilify	Schizophrenia	I have been on Abilify for 5 days and I can already tell the difference. I feel much more awake, together and peaceful. Plus my concentration is better.	9	October 15, 2020	30
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	I’ve been on Abilify for 5 years and it has saved my life. Only downside is I’ve gained a bunch of weight but eating healthy and exercise helps.	8	October 5, 2020	27
Abilify	Major Depressive Disorder	Was on Abilify for 5 years and did not know that was too long, now I have severe Tardive Dyskinesia would never have taken it. I must have been told of the side effects then and did not remember	4	October 3, 2020	26
Abilify	Schizoaffective Disorder	It started off great on Abilify.  I had so much energy and it helped me get up early with more energy.  However once I got to 5mg it turned into a nightmare.  Extreme anxiety around people and I would feel like crying for almost no reason.  I do not like it and am thankful my doctor let me stop taking it	1	October 3, 2020	11
Abilify	Schizophrenia	I am currently on Prozac 20 mg for panic disorder and depression and Abilify 10mg for schizophrenia and trazodone 50 mg to sleep and all I can say is wow! This combination has literally saved my life.  I wish I would have gotten on Abilify years ago for schizophrenia, it has totally changed my life.  If you have schizophrenia I’d say definitely give it a try! It has drastically improved my quality of life!	10	October 2, 2020	27
Abilify	Autism	My daughter (13) was put on Abilify when she was 7 for aggression and severe behaviours. At first it seemed to help but after awhile she was just back to her usual severe behaviours. She use to be a tiny girl but she became over weight very quickly with this med. We had to put locks on the fridge and cupboards but then she literally ripped the doors off to get to the food!! Over the years we tried to wean her off several times but the side effects of weaning were terrible so every time we would put her back on. This time we have been weaning her off very very slowly over several months now, weaning down 2.5 mgs a month and it’s been much easier on her system. We have noticed a dramatic change in her seizures and she hasn’t had one in months now. We haven’t seen any changes in her behaviours, she isn't any worse, the same today on 2.5 mgs as she was when she was on 20mgs. So we really don’t think it was doing anything for her.	1	October 2, 2020	20
Abilify	Major Depressive Disorder	My doctor prescribed me 5mg of Abilify to add onto a depression medication when I was going through a hard time. Maybe I had personal side effects, but it was a nightmare. I constantly felt restless- my legs would not stop moving and it was extremely difficult for me to sit at work for long periods of time. I also constantly would wake up with migraines and dry mouth.  While it helped with my depression a little bit, it definitely increased my anxiety and ruined my sex drive.  Abilify also caused me to have an insatiable appetite. I was always hungry and never felt full. Within 4 months of taking Abilify, I gained 20lbs. After going off the medication, 6 months later my appetite is noticeably different and I dropped 12lbs.   Since being off the medication, I feel more like myself and that my personality is returned. Honestly, I can't recommend this unless you have no other options.	2	September 22, 2020	25
Abilify	Major Depressive Disorder	I have been on Abilify (2.5 mg daily) for 3 weeks now for MDD. I also take Effexor XR, and have for several months now. After one week on the Abilify I began to have a dramatic change in my motivation. I keep myself busy now, where as before I struggled to do simple tasks.  I do struggle with sleeping now. I used to be able to go to sleep anytime I wanted to with no trouble. Now I cannot sleep. I wake up by midnight, and spend the rest of the night doing things like painting, or online shopping!! I cannot sleep. I hope this side effect is temporary. I started taking 3 mg of melatonin before bed, but that only helps a little bit. The other side effect during night is night sweats. It is only after I fall asleep that the sweating occurs. When I wake up I am soaked in my sweat, not too different than when a fever breaks.  As much as I want my ability to sleep back, I will continue to take the abilify because it is changing my life for the better. I no longer sleep all day, or lack motivation.	9	September 22, 2020	29
Abilify	Major Depressive Disorder	I've been on abilify  for 2 years and its caused me severe  eye problems  elevated  my depression	1	September 12, 2020	7
Abilify	Agitated State	Honestly I feel horrible, even after 24 hrs of taking Abilify, I am a MESS, I can’t keep anything down, I feel sick. I feel like I should just run around to get rid of this horrible feeling. My ears are ringing. I can’t get rid of this weird muffled head feeling it’s a nasty drug. I just cannot relax. I’m more panicky and agitated than usual	1	September 8, 2020	22
Abilify	Schizophrenia	I couldn't sleep on Abilify and the anxiety was horrible. I wasn't able to go to work as I was terribly afraid of all the people. I developed a fear of acting out on this drug. It's been more than 6 months now that I've stopped this drug and the fear stills very present but a bit reduced. I can go to work again but I still very much afraid of social interactions.	1	September 2, 2020	18
Abilify	Autism	15 year old son was prescribed Abilify for anxiety and aggression that started recently. It stopped the aggression and regulated his sleep cycle nicely. However, after 5 months, he started having crying episodes and seemed depressed mixed with mood swings.  Side effects included drooling and feeling like he had to pee but couldn't. It amplified fixated/recurring thoughts to the point of serious debilitation. Doctor advised to try reducing dose. Found Ativan worked better when there was any potential flareup and have used that on an as-needed basis. Reducing dose and hoping to find better solution.	6	September 2, 2020	14
Abilify	Depression	I was on this Abilify for a month or so for depression to enhance my anti depressant and I had the worst experience. It made me have the most awful night terrors/nightmares and I starting hallucinating, seeing little tiny people run around my room and I thought they were going to hurt me if I went to sleep. I still don't understand why I was given this as a minor	1	August 30, 2020	32
Abilify	Depression	If you want to get fat take Abilify.	1	August 29, 2020	47
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	I've been struggling with bipolar II my whole life and have been hospitalized twice. This last time they put me on abilify in addition to my lamictal and lexapro along with trazadone for sleep. First, the side effects. They were pretty bad in the beginning super restless, high anxiety, couldn't concentrate on anything unless it involved my hands. I did a lot of adult coloring and rearranged my house a few times. I was treated with ativan for about 2 weeks, a double dose of trazadone at night, and self treated with THC. The side effects are starting to wear off and it's like I can see the world in color! My husband says I'm acting like when we first met and the sparkle is back in my eyes. If you have side effects, work with your doctor. I am so glad I did and stayed on this med. It's been a month and totally life changing.	8	August 24, 2020	66
Abilify	Depression	Abilify works great for me, I couldn't even get over a bridge without freaking out, not any more. I have Epilepsy, so I can tolerate a lot of anti psychotics, but this one really works.	9	August 21, 2020	35
Abilify	Depression	This drug Abilify made me gain 60 lbs over 3.5 years. It did nothing for me. Be aware. It will make you want to eat!!! This did absolutely nothing for me. Finally came off of it and feeling better then when I was on it.		August 19, 2020	39
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	helped me with the bipolar disorder	10	August 19, 2020	19
Abilify	Agitated State	"Im going to keep it short & sweet. Before Abilify it was a lot of swearing and slammed doors, and irritation towards everyone. Abilify 5mg was prescribed about 2 months ago. Life now is more of a ""what was I mad about""? Great mood stabilizer. This medication has lifted me in so many ways.  Background: Bipolar, depression & anxiety..."	9	August 15, 2020	73
Abilify	Schizophrenia	This Abilify was my first antipsychotic I was put on. It wasted a year of my life. I had to abuse stimulants (which made my symptoms worse) to function. My hallucinations were semi controlled but I still heavily struggled with delusions. I thought it was the best I could get but no. After trying many more I found an antipsychotic that doesn't make me a robot. If this one makes you feel terrible, ask your doctor talk about your options. Don't settle for any less than you deserve! Life is livable with Schizophrenia but you have to have the right tools.	1	August 9, 2020	24
Abilify	Agitated State	My 9 year old son started Abilify a week ago. Prior to, he was diagnosed with Intermittent Explosive Disorder and possibly ADHD. He has struggled with intense burst of extreme anger. He would yell, scream, throw things, hit himself, slam doors etc. He would be angry very quickly over small things. He was very impulsive, and had many troubles at school focusing. We tried 2 different ADHD meds with no luck. They actually made things worse. His behaviour changed the moment he started Abilify, at a low dose of 2mg a day. We expected weeks until seeing results. My child is a completely different person. He is calm, polite, and so pleasant. He has voiced his own opinion on feeling this med is working. He can feel the difference within himself. He displays no side effects. He still feels and shows emotions, just in a calm manner. We have struggled heartbreakingly for a long time in finding him help, with nothing that has actually worked. This has absolutely changed his life.	9	August 6, 2020	59
Abilify	Major Depressive Disorder	I've been on abilify for about a month along side my Pristiq.  Within a week my anger started to lessen and I was able to start to function again, even wanting to socialise and shower again.  I am still showing   improvements as the weeks progress.  I do however , get manageable restless legs on 10mg.  Its much more manageable than my anger was and if I'm moving or engaged with something I don't notice it. Prazosin at night counteracts the restless legs which I was on prior to abilify for PTSD nightmares. Live changer for me..	10	July 2, 2020	36
Abilify	Major Depressive Disorder	Have never ever left a review on anything before but this drug Abilify has helped me so much so far. Was out of work, struggling to meet my basic functions necessary to live. I am now feeling like I can actually do things. I also suffer from anxiety and this has helped me so much with social anxiety/ physical symptoms from anxiety. Have been looking for a drug that will work for the past 5 years as I am treatment resistant. Give this a try people please!!	9	June 17, 2020	63
Abilify	Autism	I've had horrible shaking all over my body, even on the smallest dose (2.5mg), to the point where I couldn't walk and was escorted in a wheelchair in my room. This medication was given to me for no apparent reason, like everyone else in the ward (autistic and non autistic). I was the only one not handling it.	1	June 14, 2020	13
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	I just started this Abilify at a 5mg dose and am going up to 10 mg today. Side effects were - nausea briefly -  restlessness that might keep waking you up at night. Both of these went away. I was told by my psych that I might feel shaky but that should pass. Positives so far are less rumination and constant thinking. Less daydreaming. It doesn’t affect my actual ability to think. I haven’t gone manic on this yet. My temperament seems to be even and my energy level is good. I'll check back in in a month with the 10mg review. Thanks all.	8	June 9, 2020	71
Abilify	Major Depressive Disorder	I have very ruminative, treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (MDD) for which I've been hospitalized twice despite medication therapy and counseling.  I have trialed at least twelve different antidepressants over the last twenty years, with modest results at best.  During my second hospitalization, the attending psychiatrist presented a choice: lithium or aripiprazole (or neither, that was technically a choice, too).  I asked him what he thought and his recommendation was aripiprazole, so we went with that.  We started at 2.5 mg, then quickly moved to 5 mg.  Within days I was no longer having mood crashes, my ruminations had diminished, and my mood had started to recover.  I've stayed out of hospital ever since.  I currently take 10 mg daily and experience no side effects.  I still have my ups and downs (as is life) but my 'down' phases are shorter and much less severe.  This med has been a lifesaver for me.	9	June 6, 2020	70
Abilify	Schizoaffective Disorder	Abilify is the only antipyshcotic I've tried that works. I take the injection 300 mg every 28 days.	10	June 1, 2020	19
Abilify	Major Depressive Disorder	I was on Abilify for 2 weeks and developed Tardive Dyskinisea quickly. It started with hip thrusting and then mouth smacking, eyes blinking. I couldn’t handle it. I was on a fairly low dose once a day. I also take a small dose of Reglan daily for gastroparesis and I went off of that and quit eating (can’t eat without it) to see if the TD would stop and it didn’t. So I am quitting the Abilify. I did have one positive experience though with Abilify and that’s that it brought me out of my extreme depression to where I was able to get up and shower and do normal things again. My depression had gotten so bad that I couldn’t even shower. So would I recommend this drug? Give it a try but make sure if you show any signs of TD to talk to your doctor ASAP!	3	May 31, 2020	34
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	I took this medication for about two months I'd say. The highest I ever went to was 5mg. While it did work on the depression, it made the mania a lot worse to the point where I went psychotic and ended up in the hospital. The biggest issue I had was that the doctor was very intent on keeping me on this drug despite the fact it was not working.	1	May 28, 2020	23
Abilify	Schizophrenia	I took this drug a few years ago and felt like rubbish! My anxiety came back, I lost confidence and my eyes were rolling up. I hated this drug! But now I know every drug works differently with people so this may be good for someone else but for me it was rubbish as!	1	May 28, 2020	14
Abilify	Depression	This is my first day taking Abilify 5 mg.  I am at work and I feel HORRIBLE.  I'm thinking about going home. I am dizzy, sweating, and just feel out of it. I took it 2 1/2 hours ago and wish I had the ability to make myself barf to get it out of me, but it was such a small tab it has probably dissolved. I hate my dr. for putting me on this. I feel like a zombie. Actually found myself staring at my computer with my mouth open. Awful, horrible rx.	1	May 22, 2020	61
Abilify		I took this medicine Abilify for two weeks. It gave me energy like never before. It was good energy. However, I was too hyper and the medicine caused me to have restlessness and caused my left leg hurt BADLY. I could only sleep for 3 hours a night.	6	May 20, 2020	13
Abilify	Schizophrenia	Abilify made me completely out of control. I acted in ways I never had before and where completely out of character for me. I was not in control of my emotions I cried hysterically all the time. I had to be put on something similar to Xanax because I guess my mouth moved uncontrollably. I developed a gambling problem and was out of control with a lot of different things all at one time. I couldn’t stop any of this behavior and it was tormenting. I wasn’t able to cope either. Horrible experience. Do not smoke marijuana with this I would advise against it it will use everything against you and become a problem and made me sicker.	1	May 14, 2020	16
Abilify	Schizoaffective Disorder	It appeared to help because taking it happened to occur at the same time as my symptoms getting much better.  Over the years, that was the story being told. No other medication before it did anything for me, so it seemed to be safe for me to stay on Abilify. I finally experimented with taking less after I realized I seemed different than other people. I was wondering why I could never remember things very well and was not very confident or comfortable. It has been a year tapering off from 15 mg daily and I am finally almost completely off.  I have improved tremendously and for the first time in 15 years feel like myself.   I did not realize how much this medication was making me dumb.  Life is too important to mess up. As always, listen and trust your own intuition first. If you start to feel negative affects for any reason, so much that you do not enjoy life as fully as you feel you should,  stop this med.	1	May 2, 2020	21
Abilify	Major Depressive Disorder	I’ve had major depressive disorder for years. The past 3 years I’ve had weeks where I wouldn’t move out of bed except to go the bathroom, get a bottle of water & that’s it. I was wasting away. My doctor said I was malnourished. I didn’t care about anything, anyone or myself. I’ve started seeing a psychiatrist & therapist for almost 2 years, but had yet to find the right meds. Then, about 3 months ago my psychiatrist put me on Abilify. I went from 5mg to 7.5 to now 10mg. I take it along with Remeron & Lamictal. I feel better than I have in years. So far, no side effects. This is like the sun I’ve been searching for for many years. Happy tears. Honestly it saved my marriage.	10	May 1, 2020	59
Abilify	Schizoaffective Disorder	I was on this for about two, almost three years before I stopped taking it. During that time I was more depressed than before more consistently. 0/10 do not recommend.	1	April 26, 2020	7
Abilify	Autism	My young adult autistic son has recently began taking Abilify at 2ml liquid per day and it is nothing short of a miracle. We have had years of aggression.. hitting biting and smashing our home. He is still the same autistic boy with his usual traits but the aggression is GONE. Tried respiridol previously which did nothing so don't give up... different meds work for different people. Has been taking this for 6 weeks so far.	10	April 24, 2020	47
Abilify	Schizoaffective Disorder	This is a terrible drug!! I would recommend to never take this. I was on it for 3 months and it was the worst 3 months of my life. My anxiety and depression got so much worse and I felt as if I was trapped with no where to go or no hope. It also made me feel as if I were out of reality .	1	April 18, 2020	11
Abilify	Major Depressive Disorder	"Abilify helped me go from hardly being able to get off the couch for months to cleaning the house. Things feel ""possible"", and you see something and think ""I'll take care of that now."" I'd say it doesn't make your mental state better so much as it fixes the body depression.   I take abilify for MDD with Wellbutrin, and they're a great combo for me. The wellbutrin is great for my mood, and abilify allows me to get off the couch. I was worried when I started taking abilify because I didn't feel anything at all until day 9 or 10, so give it some time to start working.  I haven't experienced any side effects, and have actually lost weight because of how much more I'm moving around. I'm on 4mg (two 2mg pills). One weird thing about the pills is that they're TINY, like 1/4 the size of a tic tac, no joke."	10	April 17, 2020	43
Abilify	Schizophrenia	Whilst being forced to take this drug Abilify, on several occasions maybe around 10 or so times, mid stream during urinating my stream would suddenly stop and ejaculation would flow out and this is also very painful. This stopped happening when I stopped taking the drug.	1	April 7, 2020	7
Abilify	Schizophrenia	I'm on Abilify and no longer hearing voices but I still see people who aren't there. Even while on the highest dose of this medication 400mg injection.. I also feel like a zombie most of the time. I'm too tired even to go grocery shopping at times. I'm myself again but I'm not quite the same. I've gained weight 30 plus pounds and I've been on the drug for 3 years. I tried going off of it to 300 and the side effects were my moodiness returned... Sometimes I question if my diagnosis was correct or they are just pushing this drug out to anyone who claims they are depressed.	5	April 2, 2020	16
Abilify	Schizophrenia	When I was first diagnosed with psychosis, about six years ago, they put me on risperidone. It was only recently that I discovered that, for all that time, even a moderate dose like 3.5mg/night was making me sleepy ALL DAY, I had no motivation, I became completely inert, I gained a lot of weight, maybe 50 or so pounds, which is a lot for my height. They recently switched me to abilify, and I’ve gotta say, it’s a hundred times better! I’m back to being “up”, I’m interested in things again, in being productive, I can even work. As for the weight, it doesn’t give me the appetite that risperidone did, nor does it mess up my blood sugar levels like risperidone did. There’s still a bit of fatigue, but my concerta, prescribed for ADD, nips that in the bud, and besides, even without the c, the fatigue levels are just nowhere near risperidone levels. TL;DR in terms of fatigue, motivation levels and weight gain, abilify is, by FAR, the better choice over risperidone.	8	March 26, 2020	44
Abilify	Schizoaffective Disorder	Abilify is the worst possibly drug. Gain weight  Zombie  Restless  No sleep really totally insomnia.  It's horrible. Stay away from this. Holy moly	1	March 21, 2020	8
Abilify	Schizoaffective Disorder	I have schizophrenia, anxiety (generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder), and depression. I started wellbutrin and abilify 4 days ago and I also take Loxapine. Because I started Wellbutrin and Abilify at the same time, I'm not sure which one is working for my anxiety. But it was at a solid 8.6/10 and now it's down to 5.5/10. So whatever Abilify and wellbutrin is doing, it's working for my anxiety a lot.	8	March 13, 2020	23
Abilify	Schizophrenia	This drug is okay for Psychosis but it can make me tired at times and sometimes I cannot sleep. I have insomnia from it. It takes away the bad thought but can make me have OCD like thought patterns and ruminating thoughts. I have been having odd side affects from it as well like blurred vision needing to look up all the time and sensitivity to light in my eyes.  I feel more tired on it then I do off of it. My dose I take 400mg monthly and these are the side affects I am getting off of it.	6	March 10, 2020	11
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	Abilify and zoloft work well for my bipolar depression. My mood was never been so controlled, I feel like a new and normal person. It kills my sex drive so I also take a supplement for women which helps a lot.	10	March 7, 2020	43
Abilify	Schizophrenia	My son was diagnosed with schizophrenia in 2017 at the age of 21. He tried just about every psychiatric medications in the market over a period of two years with little improvements and lots of side effects including weight gain etc..  Finally he was put on Abilify 20mg daily tablets ,within less than a month his condition started to improve significantly. He is now on a monthly injection which is very convenient. No side effects what so ever. It is now almost a year and we are very pleased with the results. Abilify was a god send.	9	March 3, 2020	35
Abilify	Depression	I was on Abilify a grand total of 10 days before I had to stop. It’s hard to describe how anxious/claustrophobic/panicky/nauseous I felt in that short about of time. My suicidal thoughts spiked due to the intensity of the fever dream-like delirium. It felt like I was trapped on a roller coaster inside my own head, nauseous and ready to hurl, yet I couldn’t get off. I guess you could say my depression subsided, but that’s because my mind simply couldn’t focus on anything besides how horrendous I felt.  I’ve only ever suffered from anxiety and depression, but abilify made me feel truly psychotic.	2	February 25, 2020	81
Abilify	Depression	This is a very motivating medication. I get out of bed and am motivated to make the most of my day. It is like a miracle for me. I was switched over to the generic, Aripiprazole and felt about half of the effect. Even though my doctor moved my prescription up to a 5mg it still does not work like the original. The generic is not the same.	10	February 21, 2020	94
Abilify	Autism	Abilify has been life changing for our family. Our autistic sons aggression towards his siblings had been a major problem for many years and other drugs that were prescribed didn't help much. Much to our surprise, a day or two after starting abilify our son immediately backed down from arguing for the first time in his life. We were all absolutely stunned. My sons irritable and aggressive  behaviour (due to his autism) wreaked havoc on our family and destroyed relationships between our kids. I just wish our son had been prescribed Abilify before so much damage was done.	9	February 19, 2020	48
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	Abilify helped with my manic episodes, but gained 15 pounds after a month and spiralled into a horrible depression that saw me in bed for weeks after I tried to come off the drug.  Felt near completely disabled. Not for me.	1	February 17, 2020	23
Abilify	Schizoaffective Disorder	"I was forced to take the maximum dose of this drug through what is called a CTO ""community treatment order"". It did absolutely nothing but make me tired and put on weight. And very low sex drive. In 1 year and a half after trying a number of antipsychotics, I went from weighing 160 pounds to now weighing over 220... that's about the only thing these drugs seem to be good for. I have absolutely no motivation to do anything either. I'm now on Loxapine which is supposed to be weight neutral, but still I seem to be putting some weight on. I would recommend loxapine more than any antipsychotic I've tried only because it has put on the least amount of weight."	1	February 15, 2020	8
Abilify	Depression	Abilify is absolutely amazing. Life changing. Can't believe how much better I feel.	10	February 15, 2020	77
Abilify	Agitated State	Been on Abilify 2mg for one week. Started Abilify to help with PTSD and Lupus. Periods of high anxiety causes my Lupus to flare. No anxiety = no Lupus. Anxiety is gone which is wonderful, but it's been replaced with nausea. It's not bad enough to cause vomiting, just annoying. I have no appetite and have lost 4 pounds so far. Some trouble sleeping. I take melatonin to help with that. I hope the nausea goes away. If it does, Abilify could be the one for me.	7	February 12, 2020	34
Abilify		I was prescribed this Abilify with escitalopram, and the effects on my mood (I have borderline personality disorder) was amazing. I am back to a stable life.	10	February 12, 2020	26
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	This medication has ruined my self esteem and essentially my life. I have gained 50 lbs from this medication. That wasn’t a typo 50 freaking lbs!!! I’ve recently stopped taking it but no weight has come off yet. I’m beside myself. I don’t know what to do. I hate the way I look now.	1	February 6, 2020	38
Abilify	Schizophrenia	This medication Abilify has been life changing for me. I lost my job and was scared about my future living with schizophrenia. I'm currently taking 15mg daily in the morning. I do experience some symptoms from time to time. So I am going to have them up my dose to 20mg. But overall I am thrilled and thankful for this medication.	9	February 5, 2020	26
Abilify	Autism	Abilify worked to help with aggression but my son is now a serious diabetic. He gained 50 pounds. We are heartbroken.	5	February 4, 2020	28
Abilify	Autism	My son, 17, has been on Abilify for the last three months, and his transitions from one thing to the next is a lot less amplified and his concentration is  stronger. It has only been three months, though, so I will book mark this page and let you know how he is in 3 more months. He's been diagnosed Asperger Syndrome since 5 y.o. Perhaps it works better on AS? He could definitely gain some weight since he is on a weight lifting program. He is a lot less argumentative. He also is a devout believer and  biblical Christianity, so coupled with prayer, bible study, staying away from sexual or violent movies and video games, this makes a difference in this overall health.	10	February 2, 2020	32
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	Be careful, Abilify caused a massive compulsive gambling addiction where I lost tens of thousands over time.  I mentioned it to the doctor early on but she ignored it, didn't note it or change the meds.  Guess I was hooked on the buzz.  Stopped taking Abilify.  Stopped gambling recklessly.  Compulsive gambling addiction is a mental health disorder itself.  Who'd have thought that the NHS would prescribe this dangerous drug that can cause it?  Sounds ridiculous but true.  There was a guy with Parkinsons prescribed it in England, went full on the National Lottery online games and scratch cards etc ... but won his case for not being advised properly of the potential side effects and got most of the losses back.  They don't care for my complaint.    A class action lawsuit is underway in the United States because it wasn't on the label.  Suing a big Japanese pharmaceutical company seems okay.  Lost all interest in work and drifted for 18 months.	2	February 2, 2020	25
Abilify	Major Depressive Disorder	Within the first few days I could feel Abilify working to lift my depression, giving me more optimism and energy. However, at my starting dose of 5 mg, I had restless legs both during the day and at night. A lowered dose of 2 mg worked great for a few months, but now it’s ineffective (this is the dose I’m currently on). My psychiatrist had me increase the dose but I didn’t feel any effects, so she put me back down to 2 mg. I’m also taking Adderall, and I notice if I skip a dose of Abilify and then take Adderall, I get really bad anxiety as the Adderall wears off. So right now it’s kind of a neutral medication for me.	7	February 1, 2020	19
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	I am diagnosed with Bipolar 1 and in my 20s suffered through 3 major manic psychotic episodes which led to at least month long hospitalizations each time. After the first episode, I was put on zyprexa in which I felt zombified and depressed on which led me to go off of it entirely. Less than a year later I was hospitalized again and at that point I was introduced to Abilify. Three years passed during which I was stable. I then went off of it which led to my third and final hospitalization. Ever since then I took the 20mg tablets religiously and would soon combine it with Lamictal. This combo has worked wonders for me. Years ago a doctor told me that I’m on the Rolls Royce of bipolar medication and I firmly agree. About a year ago I started taking the 400mg injection which helped me lose at least 30 pounds. I find the injection the most effective method of taking Abilify. It has been a life saver for me!	10	January 25, 2020	56
Abilify	Depression	Been on Abilify 7.5 mg in conjunction with Cymbalta and Lamictal, and boy has it made a difference in my mood.  I've had major unipolar depression over the years, and am in process of recovering from a severe episode.  I am able to function so much better in life.  No apparent side effects from Abilify either.	9	January 24, 2020	93
Abilify	Depression	I benefit from abilify for MDD. I noticed a huge improvement in my functioning and am able to get more things done. It's not that I have extra energy, I just feel less overwhelmed by doing things and therefore am able to do them. It's helped me lose weight by increasing my ability to be active, and also decreasing my stress/emotional eating. It increased my sex drive, which was something I was struggling with in depression. Overall I recommend this drug for MDD. However, I just recently increased from 7.5mg to 15mg and am starting to feel dizzy and get head aches. Maybe this will lesson or pass soon. If it gets worse then I'll reduce my dose. But I've found this medication to be particularly helpful whereas I've tried a LOT of other meds and find no results. I am also taking lamicital 200mg for BPD/PTSD.	10	January 23, 2020	72
Abilify	Bipolar Disorder	Have been on Abilify (Generic) for about a month now. My lows are higher and my highs are nonexistent. I’m mostly flat emotionally, lacking interest in everything, including people. Good for my irritability and delusions, but the side effects are tough.	5	January 19, 2020	34
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Autism	This really helped my rage/irritability but not possible to continue taking due to severe weight gain. I was put on it when I was 12 and it completely halted my metabolism. I was 75lbs when I started it and within 2 months I was 140lbs. I went from a double zero size to a size 13 in just 8 weeks. I no joke could gain weight from eating an apple. I have stretch marks and extra skin to this day (12 years later) from it. I got off it as soon as we switched drs (my dr at the time refused).	3	April 15, 2021	1
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Agitated State	I’ve been dealing with anger/mood issues. My psychiatrist put me on 5mg Abilify. I took it last night for the first time. I woke up puking, and having diarrhea. I have had a dizzy spell, if I get up. My heart will race. It was recommended to take before bedtime. But, I’ve been up all night. Wasn’t a pleasant experience.	2	April 9, 2021	4
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Depression	I've had abilify added to my antidepressants for several years now and it really helps.  This month it was suggested I try stopping the abilify and I've slowly become terribly depressed again.  Still on my antidepressants but sad, tearful, like a lonely and lost soul.  I’m going to restart it ASAP along with my antidepressants.	9	April 9, 2021	9
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Depression	I took Abilify 10mg for several years.  It really helped me stabilize my moods and get my depression under control and took away a to of my urges of self harming behaviors. I have found Abilify much more helpful than any other traditional SSRI/antidepressant I have tried in the past like Lexapro, Prozac, and Zoloft. None of those medications really made a significant impact. The reason I stopped taking Abilify is because of the weight gain.  Personally, antipsychotic medications have always cause weight gain for me.  I gained about 50 pounds while on Abilify. I switched to 50mg Lamictal and have started losing some of the weight.  Abilify can really be life changing, but you just have to be aware of the possible side effects.	7	April 8, 2021	4
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Depression	Truly life saving.  Tortured by intrusive ruminating depressive and anxious thinking.  Abilify 5mg is the magic bullet that I didn’t think existed.  Return of calm peace of mind.  Off all other meds.  No side effects.	10	April 3, 2021	24
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Major Depressive Disorder	I was suicidal from the age of 10 till the age of 45 years of age. I had a deep, constant desire to die, and nothing was helping them. I also suffered from major depression, borderline personality disorder, general anxiety disorder and binge eating. My doctor was at a loss of what to try. Finally after years of suffering I stopped having suicidal ideation now that I a on Abilify! I am now 47 years old. I am so glad my doctor put me on this drug. It saved my life.	10	April 3, 2021	2
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	I was prescribed 2mg of Abilify to take for being diagnosed with bipolar depression. I started with half the tablet in the morning and omg! I felt sleepy the first day and somewhat disoriented. I felt that anxious feeling you get with new meds hours later. At night, lights were so bright to me and it also gave me insomnia. Second and third days were worse with side effects. I almost dialled 911. I was perspiring, felt lightheaded and extremely weak. It made me feel paranoid. Had a panic attack and the rest of the day, I felt as if I drank 6 cups of coffee. Never again! Bye Abilify!	1	April 1, 2021	3
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Autism	This type of medication is not for autism. It was ok for a month whilst my son was distracted by the side effects. He then became more aggressive and argumentative and was hyperactive. He also developed OCD. Risperidone did not work either and he had tics on it.	1	March 26, 2021	2
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Schizophrenia	This drug is terrible.It keeps me up at night, wide awake! I had the depot injection, now it will not let me sleep for a month. I have been on it for 9 days, counting down the days. What can help with sleep? I tried quetiapine.it didn't work. I don't even know if my dr will stop this injection. Fingers crossed, he will.in 21 days. Don't take the injection form if you have a choice .For me,I don't have a choice.	1	March 25, 2021	1
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Depression	I have been having pretty bad depression and severe lack of motivation for a while. I have failed many antidepressants. I recently switch to Effexor XR 75mg which did provide some relief for both depression & anxiety. I tried slightly increasing the dose but it made me feel a bit wired, so I stayed at 75mg.  I don’t like the idea of taking an antipsychotic daily but I also couldn’t live with the way I was feeling and the life style it brought. I started Abilify  and have been taking 2.5mg at night for a week (half a 5mg tab) along with the Effexor. It has definitely provided additional relief from depression. Other psych meds I take are Klonopin 1mg two to three times a day as needed, Remeron 30mg and Melatonin gummies 5mg for sleep as well as Seroquel 50-100mg only if needed for sleep, and Adderall 10mg as needed for ADD.	9	March 24, 2021	6
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Schizophrenia	I've been on Abilify for about five days. And I noticed a big change. I'm not having any intrusive/destruction thoughts. I'm not hearing voices. Even my dreams have gotten better. So, I WOULD DEF RECOMMEND!	10	March 11, 2021	14
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	Made me feel like complete rubbish for a year.  It was hard to do anything.  All I wanted to do was eat and sleep.	1	March 9, 2021	7
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	I've been on Abilify for 7 months now, 15mg. Initially for the first month I felt restless but full of energy. I had mild nausea that made me loose 7lbs. Then over time these symptoms disappeared and I experienced calmness. No paranoia anymore and my negative thoughts have been reduced dramatically. So did my manic episodes and my depression, So I’m now stable. However I've put on 18lbs even with exercising everyday I can’t seem to shift the weight! But the good over rides the bad. I recommend this medication for bpd and Bipolar it’s changed my life	9	March 6, 2021	10
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	Abilify has changed my life. I’m a healthy 23 year old who suffers from bdp (bipolar disorder) and eating disorders.  My moods are stable & can finally bring myself to eat again. If you're skeptical, don’t be. This will change your life like it has mine. No nasty side effects except weird vivid dreams but I’ll take that over the bpd and day!	10	March 4, 2021	1
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Schizoaffective Disorder	I was on Abilify for 11 years and noticed that it made my mind clearer but numb. I was then taken off the medication on medical advice which led to 2 arrests and being sectioned. I’m back on Abilify but I’m very very concerned about the long term effects of this medication.	3	February 28, 2021	2
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Schizoaffective Disorder	This drug works for the paranoia and hallucinations. It helps me organize my thoughts and not forget everything I'm doing when I walk into another room. I lost 20lb on this drug, but I was on a higher dose of Seroquel before...so not sure if I just lost weight because I came off the higher dose of seroquel. Now I weigh 118lb at 5'3, instead of 130-140lb. It's great other than some restlessness. Push through the initial restlessness, it gets better.	9	February 27, 2021	2
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	I'm 40 year old, never took drugs before.  I went on 5mg abilify and 2mg Zoloft after my life turned into a nightmare  (mom died, jail, divorce, lost custody of kid, no job, etc) Deep depression and anxiety, Doc gave ability with 2mg Zoloft. Gained 60lb in first 6 months. 5’3” from 160 to 220 lbs. with CBT therapist to support me, I eventually found a job:  I took abilify 5mg for the 2 years and sometimes 10 mg to deal with job stress. Abilify stabilized my mood and helped me focus on job and not dwell on pain and hurt of the nightmare years personal life — it kept my thoughts from spinning me into a deep depression. Was able to socialize. Was 60 lbs overweight with BMI of 34. After one year and wearing off, doc switch me to vraylar.  Vraylar made me more of an emotionally stable rock, not too high or low, headache, no snack craving and eating  much less. After few months, got my doc approval to quit all meds... I lost 30 lbs easily, but had to spend 6 months in gym class to lose rest of 30 lbs.	9	February 23, 2021	1
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Depression	well, I am a 26 year old female, and I had a life saving kidney transplant on December 11th 2018. after spending 2.5 years on dialysis. i developed severe anxiety during the start of dialysis. post TX i am beyond happy. but anxiety and depression increased ive tried so many different medications for my anxiety and depression that didnt work. 1 year ago almost my doctor put me on 90 mg of cymbalta and it worked! But anxiety and depression started creeping out some more slowly and I just couldn't handle how I was feeling especially being a mother to a 6 year old boy. 2 weeks ago my doctor recommended Abilify at a very low dose to add on with my Cymbalta in which I was iffy about it and gave it some time to think about if I wanted to take it. Today is my third day taking this medication and I'm on a minimal dose at 1mg. I have been taking it in the morning and yesterday... I noticed a major positive difference within myself. I felt increasingly energized, I felt more motivated.	10	February 21, 2021	8
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Depression	Well I just started abilify last night 1mg and have yet to notice anything  I'll keep an update		February 20, 2021	3
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Depression	Abilify is a strange one. I had been on Effexor for a couple years with very slight mood improvement only. Added Abilify for 8 months. Physiologically I felt super energized, barely slept but was never tired. Tremendously productive- getting up at 4am to go running, then coming home to mark papers until I had to go to work at 730am.  Side effects were disturbing though:  compulsive swallowing, eyelids that wouldn’t open fully, severe hand tremors - couldn’t eat in front of coworkers because shaking was so bad. No weight gain or loss.  But, zero effect on mood.  I stayed on it simply because I liked being so productive.  But it didn’t help my depression all, so I abandoned it.  The shaking lingered for months after but eventually went away.	2	February 14, 2021	5
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Agitated State	I take 2.5mg of Abilify.  Abilify is my miracle drug. I have struggled with anxiety my entire life, and have PTSD. I used to struggle with feeling rage, intrusive thoughts that I just couldn’t shake and general overwhelming  anxiety. Tried and quit at least ten other meds before finding this one.   I know it works because if I accidentally forget a dose one day my anxiety is back in full force for 2-3 days after. Once it’s back in my system I’m fine again.   I haven’t had any noticeable side effects. I take trazodone and melatonin for sleep so I have no problems sleeping, and I have been intentionally losing weight by counting calories with no problem.   I quit a different med that was making my hair thin before starting this, and my hair has all come back on Abilify.   I have a prescription for a benzo for anxiety as needed, but I don’t need it anymore.	10	February 11, 2021	9
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Autism	I take it with Lexapro, and it’s been amazing for my depression and irritability. I feel better than I have in years. The only side effects I don’t care for is the insomnia/waking up in the middle of the night.	7	February 11, 2021	4
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	On the first day of abilify I experienced stabilization. My mood was stable after two weeks on Abilify and I have not experienced any side effects. I do not experience weight gain on Abilify which is a blessing. I notice that my mood is friendlier and more positive. I started eating more fruits and vegetables and I maintain a healthy diet on Abilify. I only have positive things to say about Abilify. Please give this medication a try it’ll change your life for the better.	10	February 11, 2021	8
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Depression	This is a miracle drug for me. I have been on so many antidepressants over the years for major anxiety and depression with no relief.  Within a day or two of Abilify, I feel human again. I've been on it for about 8 years and my dosage is between 2 to 4 mg. I have gained a lot of weight but I'll take it over the nightmarish way I feel when I don't. No side effects other than the weight gain. I also have found that the brand name works much better for me.	10	February 10, 2021	4
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Depression	I've been on Abilify Maintena 10mg for 4 months and I asked to be taken off the drug a week ago. It didn't help with my depression, I am emotionally numb now, still have an increased appetite and no energy. I used to be incredibly active. I don't know how much longer it will take for the side effects to disappear. Do not take his drug if you have the same symptoms.	1	February 10, 2021	7
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	First I’m going to say that I’ve never took medication in my life. I am currently 20 years old. I took a Abilify tablet for bipolar disorder. I was told to take it at night so I did. I woke up in the morning and my chest was in so much pain. My boyfriends mother checked my heartbeat with a stethoscope and my heart was fluttering after every 10 beats or so. I went to the ER, they said nothing was wrong. lol? days later it started to feel like my heartbeat would pause then start back up. The pain is currently on the left side of my chest above my breast and shoulder blade. I really don’t know what to do..? I’m too afraid to go to the doctors.	1	February 10, 2021	2
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Major Depressive Disorder	I was on Abilify 2mg 12/18-02/19, along with 20mg of Lexapro. First 10 days, I felt euphoric, energetic, motivated, excited about life.  Well, it came to a screeching halt. I was fidgety, pacing back & forth, would sit & wiggle my feet & legs, was gaining weight, wasn't sleeping & thought I was going crazy. I continued to take it for another 6 weeks to give it a chance. That was a mistake. It was all I could do to make it through a whole workday. I thought I was going out of my mind. I have been off it for 2 years & still have mild side effects, still fidgety, have restless feet & legs, & don't sleep much. As for depression, I feel I was better off before Abilify than now. I appreciate that it has been a wonderful drug for many but where there are so many uncertainties of its effects, I would research it thoroughly before taking it. I don't think most doctors, including psychiatrists, have the slightest clue of how horrible this drug is for most. I would never recommend it to anyone.	1	February 9, 2021	10
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Major Depressive Disorder	Was prescribed Abilify to help 'boost' my antidepressants. Have been on it for almost two years. Caused me to gain 50 pounds in 3 months and even with exercise and dieting have been unable to lose the weight. Also causes very vivid dreams and at higher doses causes feelings of anxiety and paranoia. I strongly suggest you take a genetic test to make sure this medication will work for you before you take this drug	2	February 9, 2021	5
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	I have always been against taking medication,  although I have epilepsy and have to. I was very weary of starting this one,  or any other mood stabilizer. Now that I have been taking it for two weeks, I'm so glad I did. It was like walking out of a dark room and back into the light of day. I use to just go about my daily activities with dread. Now I am excited to be a part of society again. I have gotten back in contact with old friends don't experience hardly any social anxiety and have so much energy. Thank you abilify	8	February 6, 2021	8
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Depression	For me Abilify was a godsend. Sometimes I get a bit hypomanic, but that still beats the soul-crushing depression snd anxiety.	8	February 5, 2021	9
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Agitated State	The side effects are bad at first - do not take Abilify at night! My feet were erratic starting out and I had a hard time sleeping because I took it at night. Another side effect: Weight gain does occur! But, this is not because the pill has calories (one review said) or because it gives you munchies (another review said). It simply changes the way your body stores leptin and processes food. Adding in slight exercise, or reducing your calories with healthier foods might help - or if you are lucky, it might not affect you at all. I did not notice the weight gain effects on the 5 mg, but I did on the 10 mg. I have gained three pounds in one week. Personally, the weight is not something I can handle, so I will be going back to 5 mg because that worked just fine for me.   It might take some experimenting but try it first (always start with a low dose).	7	February 5, 2021	5
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	Is this trash or is this trash? This made me so sleepy and tired! It made me hungry all the time! A useless medication for me! I got off of it! I am much better off without it. Other than it making me sleepy and hungry I had no other side effects. It did nothing for my bipolar disorder!	1	February 2, 2021	2
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Schizoaffective Disorder	My doctor misdiagnosed me with schizo-affective disorder even with an ADHD diagnosis as a child, but I figured I'd try it anyway because hey, maybe they got it wrong back then. So I took Abilify and by the end of week three, I damn near went psychotic and was suicidal because of it. This is the single worst drug I've ever had the displeasure of taking. I'm not saying it doesn't work but if you get misdiagnosed, which happens often enough, you're going to have a very bad time.	1	February 1, 2021	1
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	Taking Abilify as a replacement of Olanzapine, not a miracle drug, but helps mitigating paranoia and hypomania	8	January 30, 2021	3
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Major Depressive Disorder	I was prescribed Ambilify for MDD, it was added to my Citalopram.  I noticed a positive difference within 4 days.  After a few weeks on it I felt even better, had energy & motivation for the first time in years.  I slept better and was ready to get out of bed in the the morning.  However, within 3 months of taking this I gained almost 20lbs.  I had a bit of a weight problem before this so I was of course really freaked out.  My doctor told me it wasn't the Ambilify, it was my eating habits, I knew different but I loved how I felt so I kept taking it. Fast forward 6 months, I've gained 38lbs, I hate the way I look so much I won't leave my house and my depression returned.  I stopped taking it slowly, I've lost my energy and physical things are twice as hard because of my weight.    I'm seriously disappointed to have to stop taking something that helped me so much because of the extreme weight gain.	7	January 30, 2021	5
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	Been diagnosed 18 years ago with Bipolar ...OCD. panic an anxiety disorder.  I've been on antidepressants since then then a few months ago it got worse 15 panicked attacks every single night an I walked floors all night long. Every night still sleep sitting up all night. I dose off an on, all night. I've suffered all my life feeling different since I was old enough to remember  say 5 yrs old and I'm 49 now. I would like share my experience  to help someone else, since I've  always been paranoid and avoid people. I always felt shy an awkward and I guess since my new blue pill Abilify I feel so much better. After taking my first pill my racing thoughts disappeared and my moods got better and I finally feel normal.  Everything seems so enjoyable now it saved my mental well being ...	10	January 28, 2021	20
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Depression	I've been taking this along with Clonidine for a month and they increased Abilify to 5mg. Once this happened, after a bit I've started to get insomnia, restlessness/anxiousness, nausea, appetite change (not hungry). I chose to go off it myself since my psych insisted I stay on, but I couldn't keep torturing myself like this. Hopefully my body returns to normal, when I could sleep and eat without worries.	2	January 26, 2021	4
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Schizophrenia	Got rid of the hallucinations and auditory voices, mostly... Paranoia still pretty bad	5	January 26, 2021	7
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Agitated State	"My son was prescribed Abilify for ""aggressive"" behavior at age 6. It didn't really change his behavior. Within a year he began showing symptoms of ADHD, despite no signs before starting the med. Is the restlessness really ADHD, or is it akathisia caused by the med? He also became compulsive on Abilify, which I learned only recently is a known side-effect of the medication. His BMI is now borderline obese, and his metabolic labs are all elevated. I'm now tapering him off of it after more than 3 years. I've noticed a reduction in his compulsive and thrill seeking behavior, though he still can't sit still for the life of him. Hopefully those withdrawl side-effects will subside with time. If a doctor recommends your child take a mood-stabilizer, remember that a calm parent is the best mood-stabilizer for a child. This stuff isn't FDA approved for use in children for a reason. I'm not anti-medication and I'm sure this med works for some people, but this med did not work for him."	1	January 25, 2021	4
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Schizoaffective Disorder	Was prescribed this from my Pdoc. Took my scheduled doses for two days and next thing I was in the hospital. Extreme heart rate and blood pressure through the roof. Made me extremely manic and irritable. It's been six years since I have taken it and still have some effects. Thought process has changed dramatically since the episode and lost the ability to think and problem solve. I have lost most short term memory as well as some longterm. My once creative side before taking (musically, art) is now completely gone. Many tests later doctors still cannot find what the problem is, no evidence of brain damage but they do believe something was altered in my brain. Happy for anyone that can take this medication without side effect but if you get prescribed ask about these side effects. This has impacted my life drastically and since then I cannot take any medications. I'll get extremely agitated taking pills and anxiety through the roof.	1	January 25, 2021	4
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Depression	Abilify definitely helped with anxiety and depression during the 5+ years I took it, but I gained nearly 100 lbs during that time. When I discontinued use, my weight immediately stabilized and has started slowly decreasing. Anxiety and depression have unfortunately also started creeping back in.	3	January 17, 2021	8
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Agitated State	I was put on this many years ago for a nervous breakdown and it started to help almost instantly. It was a good add on to my anti depressants at the time. I was literally only on it two weeks and doc decided I didn't need it anymore. It worked a lot better than any other things I've been on over the years. No side effects	8	January 15, 2021	8
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	Took one dose & felt more agitated. It also has given me bad diarrhea. Feels like I’m prepping for a colonoscopy. My brain felt foggy, I was dizzy and sluggish during the day. NO THANK YOU!	1	January 14, 2021	3
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	Absolutely amazing has changed my life I absolutely love this medication.  It helped with my anxiety, depression, has helped with all around social anxiety, very highly recommended. I got to put down three other medications just to take this one pill a day awesome.	10	January 5, 2021	21
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Autism	My son was prescribed Abilify years ago on a low dosage and it seemed to help him a lot. He had some weight gain but not much. As he got older and bigger he started having issues again and he was taken off Abilify and put on Risperidone. It was a complete disaster and things got bad really, really fast. Eventually he was put back on Abilify at a higher dosage and taken off Risperidone and things are much better. I recommend Abilify over Risperidone any day for autism.		December 31, 2020	16
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	I took abilify for about two months after zyprexa was making me incredibly sleepy and hungry all the time. After a few weeks I became unbearably anxious and restless in a way I'd never experienced before and have never experienced since. Switched to geodon because I couldn't tolerate the extreme anxiety anymore and Geodon dose the trick. Didn't become manic so I guess it worked tho.	3	December 30, 2020	1
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	I took trileptal by itself for a long time. That helped at first but I never quite felt normal. I then hit a stressful point in my life and began having A LOT of mania and depression. I started neglecting my meds, feeling hopeless. My Dr. then suggested I take abilify 5 mg in addition to the trileptal. After seeing reviews about weight gain, increased mania, etc. I was wary about trying it but I decided to. I have not gained any weight from the med (I am 5’4 115lbs young female). The first few days I was switching rapidly between manic and depressed and had a lot of insomnia. However after about 3-4 days I noticed for the first time in 5 years I feel like myself again. I haven’t been this levelled and happy in so long. I rarely have depressive or manic episodes which is something I thought was impossible. Definitely give this a try and don’t be discouraged by the first few days. It’s so worth it.	10	December 29, 2020	17
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Schizophrenia	After one yea on low dose developed Type 2 Diabetes, 5 weeks ago.	8	December 28, 2020	5
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Schizoaffective Disorder	Terrible drug. Caused me to have seizures within two months of taking it. Discontinued it immediately.	1	December 28, 2020	2
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	I used to take Abilify for management of bipolar disorder, this medication was personally horrible in my treatment. It made my mood swings worse and I became very aggressive. I began to isolate myself . Thank goodness I am off of this medication.  My husband had a similar reaction to it almost instantly.	1	December 16, 2020	6
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Major Depressive Disorder	Abilify was THE game changer for me.   I've struggled with major Depression since childhood, and had taken pretty much every other drug out there (for 20+ years) before this was prescribed in a very low dose to augment another med I'd already been taking.   I felt NORMAL for the first time in my life.  No, didn't make me ecstatically happy--it made me feel that life was worth living for.    Unfortunately, it didn't help with my anxiety, so I eventually switched to another med in order to take only 1 med, not 3.  It was expensive but so worth it.  No side effects whatsoever (2 mg dose)	10	December 14, 2020	20
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	This was one of the worst medications I’ve ever tried. I have bipolar 2 with rapid cycling and this medication literally made me out of it. I could barely gather thoughts. I felt dumb as a rock and couldn’t focus. I also felt so agitated that it took all my energy to survive the day. It made me hungry but did nothing for depression or hypomania. My eyeballs felt like they were rolling around and I could have just stared at a white wall. Stopping it was like a dream. I took it for a few months. Worst med ever. Totally net negative. Beware if you have my combo of bipolar.	1	December 12, 2020	12
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Schizoaffective Disorder	The side affects are not worth the risk of even trying this medication.	1	December 10, 2020	2
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Schizophrenia	I have taken Abilify for 10 years for schizophrenia.  It has been a wonder drug in some aspects because it keeps my schizophrenia at bay.  Before I started taking it I was losing my mind, thought “people” were after me, heard thoughts and saw visions.  Basically I was not functional and couldn’t hold a job.  All of this has gone away over the years and now I am a functioning adult.  It regulates my sleep and moods, too.    The side effects are minimal but noticeable.  I developed type 2 diabetes even though I maintain a regular exercise schedule and eat right.  Also, I have no sex drive and it kind of screws up your all of your sexual functions.    Also, beware of these medications and take them only if you have to have them.  I developed something called tardive akathisia when I tried to stop taking Abilify.  It is an absolutely horrible side effect caused by your brain trying to return to the way it originally worked and it is truly awful. Look it up!	8	December 1, 2020	12
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Agitated State	I was recently  prescribed  abilify (the generic) during  COVID. I have PTSD BPD and depression  so with  everything  going  on it has made me insane.  I had rage outbursts and would  want to hit people, not to mention the stress and lockdown.  Everytime  I left the house  there's signs and masks everywhere- anyways I needed a change.  I tried Abilify I'm on 5mg now, I found  it actually  increased my appetite,  I gained at least  10 lbs which  I'm not fond of, but I've been  eating  again.  I find it has worked great  as far as a mood stabilizer I've only had 1 panic attack since being on it. The first few weeks  I was really  agitated and paranoid  though. If I don't take it at the exact time everyday I feel  sick.  Overall it does help with my mood and rage so I'll stay on it. I don't like the always  having  to move,  its nice  at work  but not if I ever want to relax	7	December 1, 2020	10
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	I suffer some depression, some OCD traits and may be mildly Bipolar. I take Zoloft which hugely helped my mood swings. Lately my mind has been at great unrest......consumed by worry....unable to focus. Fatigue set in and I was tired all the time....even after a good nights sleep. My Dr put me on Abilify 2mg once daily. I thought to myself.....How will such a tiny little pill help? Well I am so IMPRESSED!!!!! The brain fog and worry is gone. I wake up early every morning with energy that lasts all day long! I would totally recommend Abilify!	10	November 28, 2020	17
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Schizophrenia	I was abilify for Constantly thinking disorder, it made me gain a lot of weight I have a lot of thoughts medicine did nothing to stop them. Feel like it just created more anxiety and akathesia.	1	November 28, 2020	4
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Schizoaffective Disorder	I’ve been taking Abilify for years, I had to restart it about a month ago after being off of it for about four months. I started getting a really terrible appetite where I just wanted to keep on eating, I think I’ve gained a bit of weight while on it. I have WAY too much energy and have found I’ve become a bit impulsive. Although, any hallucinations I used to have, have lessened quite a bit so that’s a plus! I feel like the longer you’re on it, the less bad side effects you feel. If you’re feeling too energized and like the constantly need to move, it may be a thing called Akathisia; a need to always be doing something or a mental unrest. Any anger I used to have, has lessened or is gone pretty much. I do feel pretty spaced out a lot and very forgetful thought and not myself but at least the psychotic symptoms I had have lessened.	8	November 27, 2020	7
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Depression	"I was put on Abilify and it made me feel very strange. I went off it after a few days and was very glad I did. My daughter, who also suffers from depression was put on it and she went from weighing 120 pounds (at 5'6"") and gained over 100 pounds in 8-9 months. During that time she voluntarily went into the hospital for suicide ideation. I could hardly recognize her personality and was appalled to see her so morbidly obese when I saw her for the first time when I visited her to pick her up from the hospital once she was released. She looked like a zombie - pale, dark shadows under her eyes - and she was only 26 years old at the time. She went off it and it took her a long time getting her weight down at a stable 150 pounds. Her poor body went through a really hard time, not to mention the bad effect it had on her mind. AWFUL!!"	1	November 17, 2020	29
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Schizophrenia	My son is diagnose with schizophrenia in middle school his first medication was Risperdol which worked for a small amount of time however I think he outgrew it or the dosage weaken against the imbalance it took some dramatic changes before they changed his medications however when given abilify which is what he is currently taking I see vast and major improvement it took on a slow gradual change at first however now it is very noticeable that this abilfy is having a positive effect thus far on my son abilify  to think with calm mind and little to no agitation at all. IF this medication proves to be effective for a long period I would assume he may on down the road only need to adjust the dosage not now however. I would give it from my personal experience as a mother with a son who currently taking  a definite 8 out of 10 thus far.	8	October 21, 2020	20
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Schizophrenia	I have been on Abilify for 5 days and I can already tell the difference. I feel much more awake, together and peaceful. Plus my concentration is better.	9	October 15, 2020	30
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	I’ve been on Abilify for 5 years and it has saved my life. Only downside is I’ve gained a bunch of weight but eating healthy and exercise helps.	8	October 5, 2020	27
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Major Depressive Disorder	Was on Abilify for 5 years and did not know that was too long, now I have severe Tardive Dyskinesia would never have taken it. I must have been told of the side effects then and did not remember	4	October 3, 2020	26
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Schizoaffective Disorder	It started off great on Abilify.  I had so much energy and it helped me get up early with more energy.  However once I got to 5mg it turned into a nightmare.  Extreme anxiety around people and I would feel like crying for almost no reason.  I do not like it and am thankful my doctor let me stop taking it	1	October 3, 2020	11
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Schizophrenia	I am currently on Prozac 20 mg for panic disorder and depression and Abilify 10mg for schizophrenia and trazodone 50 mg to sleep and all I can say is wow! This combination has literally saved my life.  I wish I would have gotten on Abilify years ago for schizophrenia, it has totally changed my life.  If you have schizophrenia I’d say definitely give it a try! It has drastically improved my quality of life!	10	October 2, 2020	27
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Autism	My daughter (13) was put on Abilify when she was 7 for aggression and severe behaviours. At first it seemed to help but after awhile she was just back to her usual severe behaviours. She use to be a tiny girl but she became over weight very quickly with this med. We had to put locks on the fridge and cupboards but then she literally ripped the doors off to get to the food!! Over the years we tried to wean her off several times but the side effects of weaning were terrible so every time we would put her back on. This time we have been weaning her off very very slowly over several months now, weaning down 2.5 mgs a month and it’s been much easier on her system. We have noticed a dramatic change in her seizures and she hasn’t had one in months now. We haven’t seen any changes in her behaviours, she isn't any worse, the same today on 2.5 mgs as she was when she was on 20mgs. So we really don’t think it was doing anything for her.	1	October 2, 2020	20
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Major Depressive Disorder	My doctor prescribed me 5mg of Abilify to add onto a depression medication when I was going through a hard time. Maybe I had personal side effects, but it was a nightmare. I constantly felt restless- my legs would not stop moving and it was extremely difficult for me to sit at work for long periods of time. I also constantly would wake up with migraines and dry mouth.  While it helped with my depression a little bit, it definitely increased my anxiety and ruined my sex drive.  Abilify also caused me to have an insatiable appetite. I was always hungry and never felt full. Within 4 months of taking Abilify, I gained 20lbs. After going off the medication, 6 months later my appetite is noticeably different and I dropped 12lbs.   Since being off the medication, I feel more like myself and that my personality is returned. Honestly, I can't recommend this unless you have no other options.	2	September 22, 2020	25
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Major Depressive Disorder	I have been on Abilify (2.5 mg daily) for 3 weeks now for MDD. I also take Effexor XR, and have for several months now. After one week on the Abilify I began to have a dramatic change in my motivation. I keep myself busy now, where as before I struggled to do simple tasks.  I do struggle with sleeping now. I used to be able to go to sleep anytime I wanted to with no trouble. Now I cannot sleep. I wake up by midnight, and spend the rest of the night doing things like painting, or online shopping!! I cannot sleep. I hope this side effect is temporary. I started taking 3 mg of melatonin before bed, but that only helps a little bit. The other side effect during night is night sweats. It is only after I fall asleep that the sweating occurs. When I wake up I am soaked in my sweat, not too different than when a fever breaks.  As much as I want my ability to sleep back, I will continue to take the abilify because it is changing my life for the better. I no longer sleep all day, or lack motivation.	9	September 22, 2020	29
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Major Depressive Disorder	I've been on abilify  for 2 years and its caused me severe  eye problems  elevated  my depression	1	September 12, 2020	7
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Agitated State	Honestly I feel horrible, even after 24 hrs of taking Abilify, I am a MESS, I can’t keep anything down, I feel sick. I feel like I should just run around to get rid of this horrible feeling. My ears are ringing. I can’t get rid of this weird muffled head feeling it’s a nasty drug. I just cannot relax. I’m more panicky and agitated than usual	1	September 8, 2020	22
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Schizophrenia	I couldn't sleep on Abilify and the anxiety was horrible. I wasn't able to go to work as I was terribly afraid of all the people. I developed a fear of acting out on this drug. It's been more than 6 months now that I've stopped this drug and the fear stills very present but a bit reduced. I can go to work again but I still very much afraid of social interactions.	1	September 2, 2020	18
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Autism	15 year old son was prescribed Abilify for anxiety and aggression that started recently. It stopped the aggression and regulated his sleep cycle nicely. However, after 5 months, he started having crying episodes and seemed depressed mixed with mood swings.  Side effects included drooling and feeling like he had to pee but couldn't. It amplified fixated/recurring thoughts to the point of serious debilitation. Doctor advised to try reducing dose. Found Ativan worked better when there was any potential flareup and have used that on an as-needed basis. Reducing dose and hoping to find better solution.	6	September 2, 2020	14
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Depression	I was on this Abilify for a month or so for depression to enhance my anti depressant and I had the worst experience. It made me have the most awful night terrors/nightmares and I starting hallucinating, seeing little tiny people run around my room and I thought they were going to hurt me if I went to sleep. I still don't understand why I was given this as a minor	1	August 30, 2020	32
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Depression	If you want to get fat take Abilify.	1	August 29, 2020	47
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	I've been struggling with bipolar II my whole life and have been hospitalized twice. This last time they put me on abilify in addition to my lamictal and lexapro along with trazadone for sleep. First, the side effects. They were pretty bad in the beginning super restless, high anxiety, couldn't concentrate on anything unless it involved my hands. I did a lot of adult coloring and rearranged my house a few times. I was treated with ativan for about 2 weeks, a double dose of trazadone at night, and self treated with THC. The side effects are starting to wear off and it's like I can see the world in color! My husband says I'm acting like when we first met and the sparkle is back in my eyes. If you have side effects, work with your doctor. I am so glad I did and stayed on this med. It's been a month and totally life changing.	8	August 24, 2020	66
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Depression	Abilify works great for me, I couldn't even get over a bridge without freaking out, not any more. I have Epilepsy, so I can tolerate a lot of anti psychotics, but this one really works.	9	August 21, 2020	35
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Depression	This drug Abilify made me gain 60 lbs over 3.5 years. It did nothing for me. Be aware. It will make you want to eat!!! This did absolutely nothing for me. Finally came off of it and feeling better then when I was on it.		August 19, 2020	39
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	helped me with the bipolar disorder	10	August 19, 2020	19
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Agitated State	"Im going to keep it short & sweet. Before Abilify it was a lot of swearing and slammed doors, and irritation towards everyone. Abilify 5mg was prescribed about 2 months ago. Life now is more of a ""what was I mad about""? Great mood stabilizer. This medication has lifted me in so many ways.  Background: Bipolar, depression & anxiety..."	9	August 15, 2020	73
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Schizophrenia	This Abilify was my first antipsychotic I was put on. It wasted a year of my life. I had to abuse stimulants (which made my symptoms worse) to function. My hallucinations were semi controlled but I still heavily struggled with delusions. I thought it was the best I could get but no. After trying many more I found an antipsychotic that doesn't make me a robot. If this one makes you feel terrible, ask your doctor talk about your options. Don't settle for any less than you deserve! Life is livable with Schizophrenia but you have to have the right tools.	1	August 9, 2020	24
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Agitated State	My 9 year old son started Abilify a week ago. Prior to, he was diagnosed with Intermittent Explosive Disorder and possibly ADHD. He has struggled with intense burst of extreme anger. He would yell, scream, throw things, hit himself, slam doors etc. He would be angry very quickly over small things. He was very impulsive, and had many troubles at school focusing. We tried 2 different ADHD meds with no luck. They actually made things worse. His behaviour changed the moment he started Abilify, at a low dose of 2mg a day. We expected weeks until seeing results. My child is a completely different person. He is calm, polite, and so pleasant. He has voiced his own opinion on feeling this med is working. He can feel the difference within himself. He displays no side effects. He still feels and shows emotions, just in a calm manner. We have struggled heartbreakingly for a long time in finding him help, with nothing that has actually worked. This has absolutely changed his life.	9	August 6, 2020	59
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Major Depressive Disorder	I've been on abilify for about a month along side my Pristiq.  Within a week my anger started to lessen and I was able to start to function again, even wanting to socialise and shower again.  I am still showing   improvements as the weeks progress.  I do however , get manageable restless legs on 10mg.  Its much more manageable than my anger was and if I'm moving or engaged with something I don't notice it. Prazosin at night counteracts the restless legs which I was on prior to abilify for PTSD nightmares. Live changer for me..	10	July 2, 2020	36
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Major Depressive Disorder	Have never ever left a review on anything before but this drug Abilify has helped me so much so far. Was out of work, struggling to meet my basic functions necessary to live. I am now feeling like I can actually do things. I also suffer from anxiety and this has helped me so much with social anxiety/ physical symptoms from anxiety. Have been looking for a drug that will work for the past 5 years as I am treatment resistant. Give this a try people please!!	9	June 17, 2020	63
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Autism	I've had horrible shaking all over my body, even on the smallest dose (2.5mg), to the point where I couldn't walk and was escorted in a wheelchair in my room. This medication was given to me for no apparent reason, like everyone else in the ward (autistic and non autistic). I was the only one not handling it.	1	June 14, 2020	13
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	I just started this Abilify at a 5mg dose and am going up to 10 mg today. Side effects were - nausea briefly -  restlessness that might keep waking you up at night. Both of these went away. I was told by my psych that I might feel shaky but that should pass. Positives so far are less rumination and constant thinking. Less daydreaming. It doesn’t affect my actual ability to think. I haven’t gone manic on this yet. My temperament seems to be even and my energy level is good. I'll check back in in a month with the 10mg review. Thanks all.	8	June 9, 2020	71
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Major Depressive Disorder	I have very ruminative, treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (MDD) for which I've been hospitalized twice despite medication therapy and counseling.  I have trialed at least twelve different antidepressants over the last twenty years, with modest results at best.  During my second hospitalization, the attending psychiatrist presented a choice: lithium or aripiprazole (or neither, that was technically a choice, too).  I asked him what he thought and his recommendation was aripiprazole, so we went with that.  We started at 2.5 mg, then quickly moved to 5 mg.  Within days I was no longer having mood crashes, my ruminations had diminished, and my mood had started to recover.  I've stayed out of hospital ever since.  I currently take 10 mg daily and experience no side effects.  I still have my ups and downs (as is life) but my 'down' phases are shorter and much less severe.  This med has been a lifesaver for me.	9	June 6, 2020	70
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Schizoaffective Disorder	Abilify is the only antipyshcotic I've tried that works. I take the injection 300 mg every 28 days.	10	June 1, 2020	19
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Major Depressive Disorder	I was on Abilify for 2 weeks and developed Tardive Dyskinisea quickly. It started with hip thrusting and then mouth smacking, eyes blinking. I couldn’t handle it. I was on a fairly low dose once a day. I also take a small dose of Reglan daily for gastroparesis and I went off of that and quit eating (can’t eat without it) to see if the TD would stop and it didn’t. So I am quitting the Abilify. I did have one positive experience though with Abilify and that’s that it brought me out of my extreme depression to where I was able to get up and shower and do normal things again. My depression had gotten so bad that I couldn’t even shower. So would I recommend this drug? Give it a try but make sure if you show any signs of TD to talk to your doctor ASAP!	3	May 31, 2020	34
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	I took this medication for about two months I'd say. The highest I ever went to was 5mg. While it did work on the depression, it made the mania a lot worse to the point where I went psychotic and ended up in the hospital. The biggest issue I had was that the doctor was very intent on keeping me on this drug despite the fact it was not working.	1	May 28, 2020	23
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Schizophrenia	I took this drug a few years ago and felt like rubbish! My anxiety came back, I lost confidence and my eyes were rolling up. I hated this drug! But now I know every drug works differently with people so this may be good for someone else but for me it was rubbish as!	1	May 28, 2020	14
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Depression	This is my first day taking Abilify 5 mg.  I am at work and I feel HORRIBLE.  I'm thinking about going home. I am dizzy, sweating, and just feel out of it. I took it 2 1/2 hours ago and wish I had the ability to make myself barf to get it out of me, but it was such a small tab it has probably dissolved. I hate my dr. for putting me on this. I feel like a zombie. Actually found myself staring at my computer with my mouth open. Awful, horrible rx.	1	May 22, 2020	61
Abilify (Intramuscular)		I took this medicine Abilify for two weeks. It gave me energy like never before. It was good energy. However, I was too hyper and the medicine caused me to have restlessness and caused my left leg hurt BADLY. I could only sleep for 3 hours a night.	6	May 20, 2020	13
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Schizophrenia	Abilify made me completely out of control. I acted in ways I never had before and where completely out of character for me. I was not in control of my emotions I cried hysterically all the time. I had to be put on something similar to Xanax because I guess my mouth moved uncontrollably. I developed a gambling problem and was out of control with a lot of different things all at one time. I couldn’t stop any of this behavior and it was tormenting. I wasn’t able to cope either. Horrible experience. Do not smoke marijuana with this I would advise against it it will use everything against you and become a problem and made me sicker.	1	May 14, 2020	16
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Schizoaffective Disorder	It appeared to help because taking it happened to occur at the same time as my symptoms getting much better.  Over the years, that was the story being told. No other medication before it did anything for me, so it seemed to be safe for me to stay on Abilify. I finally experimented with taking less after I realized I seemed different than other people. I was wondering why I could never remember things very well and was not very confident or comfortable. It has been a year tapering off from 15 mg daily and I am finally almost completely off.  I have improved tremendously and for the first time in 15 years feel like myself.   I did not realize how much this medication was making me dumb.  Life is too important to mess up. As always, listen and trust your own intuition first. If you start to feel negative affects for any reason, so much that you do not enjoy life as fully as you feel you should,  stop this med.	1	May 2, 2020	21
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Major Depressive Disorder	I’ve had major depressive disorder for years. The past 3 years I’ve had weeks where I wouldn’t move out of bed except to go the bathroom, get a bottle of water & that’s it. I was wasting away. My doctor said I was malnourished. I didn’t care about anything, anyone or myself. I’ve started seeing a psychiatrist & therapist for almost 2 years, but had yet to find the right meds. Then, about 3 months ago my psychiatrist put me on Abilify. I went from 5mg to 7.5 to now 10mg. I take it along with Remeron & Lamictal. I feel better than I have in years. So far, no side effects. This is like the sun I’ve been searching for for many years. Happy tears. Honestly it saved my marriage.	10	May 1, 2020	59
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Schizoaffective Disorder	I was on this for about two, almost three years before I stopped taking it. During that time I was more depressed than before more consistently. 0/10 do not recommend.	1	April 26, 2020	7
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Autism	My young adult autistic son has recently began taking Abilify at 2ml liquid per day and it is nothing short of a miracle. We have had years of aggression.. hitting biting and smashing our home. He is still the same autistic boy with his usual traits but the aggression is GONE. Tried respiridol previously which did nothing so don't give up... different meds work for different people. Has been taking this for 6 weeks so far.	10	April 24, 2020	47
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Schizoaffective Disorder	This is a terrible drug!! I would recommend to never take this. I was on it for 3 months and it was the worst 3 months of my life. My anxiety and depression got so much worse and I felt as if I was trapped with no where to go or no hope. It also made me feel as if I were out of reality .	1	April 18, 2020	11
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Major Depressive Disorder	"Abilify helped me go from hardly being able to get off the couch for months to cleaning the house. Things feel ""possible"", and you see something and think ""I'll take care of that now."" I'd say it doesn't make your mental state better so much as it fixes the body depression.   I take abilify for MDD with Wellbutrin, and they're a great combo for me. The wellbutrin is great for my mood, and abilify allows me to get off the couch. I was worried when I started taking abilify because I didn't feel anything at all until day 9 or 10, so give it some time to start working.  I haven't experienced any side effects, and have actually lost weight because of how much more I'm moving around. I'm on 4mg (two 2mg pills). One weird thing about the pills is that they're TINY, like 1/4 the size of a tic tac, no joke."	10	April 17, 2020	43
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Schizophrenia	Whilst being forced to take this drug Abilify, on several occasions maybe around 10 or so times, mid stream during urinating my stream would suddenly stop and ejaculation would flow out and this is also very painful. This stopped happening when I stopped taking the drug.	1	April 7, 2020	7
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Schizophrenia	I'm on Abilify and no longer hearing voices but I still see people who aren't there. Even while on the highest dose of this medication 400mg injection.. I also feel like a zombie most of the time. I'm too tired even to go grocery shopping at times. I'm myself again but I'm not quite the same. I've gained weight 30 plus pounds and I've been on the drug for 3 years. I tried going off of it to 300 and the side effects were my moodiness returned... Sometimes I question if my diagnosis was correct or they are just pushing this drug out to anyone who claims they are depressed.	5	April 2, 2020	16
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Schizophrenia	When I was first diagnosed with psychosis, about six years ago, they put me on risperidone. It was only recently that I discovered that, for all that time, even a moderate dose like 3.5mg/night was making me sleepy ALL DAY, I had no motivation, I became completely inert, I gained a lot of weight, maybe 50 or so pounds, which is a lot for my height. They recently switched me to abilify, and I’ve gotta say, it’s a hundred times better! I’m back to being “up”, I’m interested in things again, in being productive, I can even work. As for the weight, it doesn’t give me the appetite that risperidone did, nor does it mess up my blood sugar levels like risperidone did. There’s still a bit of fatigue, but my concerta, prescribed for ADD, nips that in the bud, and besides, even without the c, the fatigue levels are just nowhere near risperidone levels. TL;DR in terms of fatigue, motivation levels and weight gain, abilify is, by FAR, the better choice over risperidone.	8	March 26, 2020	44
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Schizoaffective Disorder	Abilify is the worst possibly drug. Gain weight  Zombie  Restless  No sleep really totally insomnia.  It's horrible. Stay away from this. Holy moly	1	March 21, 2020	8
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Schizoaffective Disorder	I have schizophrenia, anxiety (generalized anxiety disorder and panic disorder), and depression. I started wellbutrin and abilify 4 days ago and I also take Loxapine. Because I started Wellbutrin and Abilify at the same time, I'm not sure which one is working for my anxiety. But it was at a solid 8.6/10 and now it's down to 5.5/10. So whatever Abilify and wellbutrin is doing, it's working for my anxiety a lot.	8	March 13, 2020	23
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Schizophrenia	This drug is okay for Psychosis but it can make me tired at times and sometimes I cannot sleep. I have insomnia from it. It takes away the bad thought but can make me have OCD like thought patterns and ruminating thoughts. I have been having odd side affects from it as well like blurred vision needing to look up all the time and sensitivity to light in my eyes.  I feel more tired on it then I do off of it. My dose I take 400mg monthly and these are the side affects I am getting off of it.	6	March 10, 2020	11
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	Abilify and zoloft work well for my bipolar depression. My mood was never been so controlled, I feel like a new and normal person. It kills my sex drive so I also take a supplement for women which helps a lot.	10	March 7, 2020	43
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Schizophrenia	My son was diagnosed with schizophrenia in 2017 at the age of 21. He tried just about every psychiatric medications in the market over a period of two years with little improvements and lots of side effects including weight gain etc..  Finally he was put on Abilify 20mg daily tablets ,within less than a month his condition started to improve significantly. He is now on a monthly injection which is very convenient. No side effects what so ever. It is now almost a year and we are very pleased with the results. Abilify was a god send.	9	March 3, 2020	35
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Depression	I was on Abilify a grand total of 10 days before I had to stop. It’s hard to describe how anxious/claustrophobic/panicky/nauseous I felt in that short about of time. My suicidal thoughts spiked due to the intensity of the fever dream-like delirium. It felt like I was trapped on a roller coaster inside my own head, nauseous and ready to hurl, yet I couldn’t get off. I guess you could say my depression subsided, but that’s because my mind simply couldn’t focus on anything besides how horrendous I felt.  I’ve only ever suffered from anxiety and depression, but abilify made me feel truly psychotic.	2	February 25, 2020	81
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Depression	This is a very motivating medication. I get out of bed and am motivated to make the most of my day. It is like a miracle for me. I was switched over to the generic, Aripiprazole and felt about half of the effect. Even though my doctor moved my prescription up to a 5mg it still does not work like the original. The generic is not the same.	10	February 21, 2020	94
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Autism	Abilify has been life changing for our family. Our autistic sons aggression towards his siblings had been a major problem for many years and other drugs that were prescribed didn't help much. Much to our surprise, a day or two after starting abilify our son immediately backed down from arguing for the first time in his life. We were all absolutely stunned. My sons irritable and aggressive  behaviour (due to his autism) wreaked havoc on our family and destroyed relationships between our kids. I just wish our son had been prescribed Abilify before so much damage was done.	9	February 19, 2020	48
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	Abilify helped with my manic episodes, but gained 15 pounds after a month and spiralled into a horrible depression that saw me in bed for weeks after I tried to come off the drug.  Felt near completely disabled. Not for me.	1	February 17, 2020	23
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Schizoaffective Disorder	"I was forced to take the maximum dose of this drug through what is called a CTO ""community treatment order"". It did absolutely nothing but make me tired and put on weight. And very low sex drive. In 1 year and a half after trying a number of antipsychotics, I went from weighing 160 pounds to now weighing over 220... that's about the only thing these drugs seem to be good for. I have absolutely no motivation to do anything either. I'm now on Loxapine which is supposed to be weight neutral, but still I seem to be putting some weight on. I would recommend loxapine more than any antipsychotic I've tried only because it has put on the least amount of weight."	1	February 15, 2020	8
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Depression	Abilify is absolutely amazing. Life changing. Can't believe how much better I feel.	10	February 15, 2020	77
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Agitated State	Been on Abilify 2mg for one week. Started Abilify to help with PTSD and Lupus. Periods of high anxiety causes my Lupus to flare. No anxiety = no Lupus. Anxiety is gone which is wonderful, but it's been replaced with nausea. It's not bad enough to cause vomiting, just annoying. I have no appetite and have lost 4 pounds so far. Some trouble sleeping. I take melatonin to help with that. I hope the nausea goes away. If it does, Abilify could be the one for me.	7	February 12, 2020	34
Abilify (Intramuscular)		I was prescribed this Abilify with escitalopram, and the effects on my mood (I have borderline personality disorder) was amazing. I am back to a stable life.	10	February 12, 2020	26
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	This medication has ruined my self esteem and essentially my life. I have gained 50 lbs from this medication. That wasn’t a typo 50 freaking lbs!!! I’ve recently stopped taking it but no weight has come off yet. I’m beside myself. I don’t know what to do. I hate the way I look now.	1	February 6, 2020	38
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Schizophrenia	This medication Abilify has been life changing for me. I lost my job and was scared about my future living with schizophrenia. I'm currently taking 15mg daily in the morning. I do experience some symptoms from time to time. So I am going to have them up my dose to 20mg. But overall I am thrilled and thankful for this medication.	9	February 5, 2020	26
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Autism	Abilify worked to help with aggression but my son is now a serious diabetic. He gained 50 pounds. We are heartbroken.	5	February 4, 2020	28
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Autism	My son, 17, has been on Abilify for the last three months, and his transitions from one thing to the next is a lot less amplified and his concentration is  stronger. It has only been three months, though, so I will book mark this page and let you know how he is in 3 more months. He's been diagnosed Asperger Syndrome since 5 y.o. Perhaps it works better on AS? He could definitely gain some weight since he is on a weight lifting program. He is a lot less argumentative. He also is a devout believer and  biblical Christianity, so coupled with prayer, bible study, staying away from sexual or violent movies and video games, this makes a difference in this overall health.	10	February 2, 2020	32
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	Be careful, Abilify caused a massive compulsive gambling addiction where I lost tens of thousands over time.  I mentioned it to the doctor early on but she ignored it, didn't note it or change the meds.  Guess I was hooked on the buzz.  Stopped taking Abilify.  Stopped gambling recklessly.  Compulsive gambling addiction is a mental health disorder itself.  Who'd have thought that the NHS would prescribe this dangerous drug that can cause it?  Sounds ridiculous but true.  There was a guy with Parkinsons prescribed it in England, went full on the National Lottery online games and scratch cards etc ... but won his case for not being advised properly of the potential side effects and got most of the losses back.  They don't care for my complaint.    A class action lawsuit is underway in the United States because it wasn't on the label.  Suing a big Japanese pharmaceutical company seems okay.  Lost all interest in work and drifted for 18 months.	2	February 2, 2020	25
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Major Depressive Disorder	Within the first few days I could feel Abilify working to lift my depression, giving me more optimism and energy. However, at my starting dose of 5 mg, I had restless legs both during the day and at night. A lowered dose of 2 mg worked great for a few months, but now it’s ineffective (this is the dose I’m currently on). My psychiatrist had me increase the dose but I didn’t feel any effects, so she put me back down to 2 mg. I’m also taking Adderall, and I notice if I skip a dose of Abilify and then take Adderall, I get really bad anxiety as the Adderall wears off. So right now it’s kind of a neutral medication for me.	7	February 1, 2020	19
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	I am diagnosed with Bipolar 1 and in my 20s suffered through 3 major manic psychotic episodes which led to at least month long hospitalizations each time. After the first episode, I was put on zyprexa in which I felt zombified and depressed on which led me to go off of it entirely. Less than a year later I was hospitalized again and at that point I was introduced to Abilify. Three years passed during which I was stable. I then went off of it which led to my third and final hospitalization. Ever since then I took the 20mg tablets religiously and would soon combine it with Lamictal. This combo has worked wonders for me. Years ago a doctor told me that I’m on the Rolls Royce of bipolar medication and I firmly agree. About a year ago I started taking the 400mg injection which helped me lose at least 30 pounds. I find the injection the most effective method of taking Abilify. It has been a life saver for me!	10	January 25, 2020	56
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Depression	Been on Abilify 7.5 mg in conjunction with Cymbalta and Lamictal, and boy has it made a difference in my mood.  I've had major unipolar depression over the years, and am in process of recovering from a severe episode.  I am able to function so much better in life.  No apparent side effects from Abilify either.	9	January 24, 2020	93
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Depression	I benefit from abilify for MDD. I noticed a huge improvement in my functioning and am able to get more things done. It's not that I have extra energy, I just feel less overwhelmed by doing things and therefore am able to do them. It's helped me lose weight by increasing my ability to be active, and also decreasing my stress/emotional eating. It increased my sex drive, which was something I was struggling with in depression. Overall I recommend this drug for MDD. However, I just recently increased from 7.5mg to 15mg and am starting to feel dizzy and get head aches. Maybe this will lesson or pass soon. If it gets worse then I'll reduce my dose. But I've found this medication to be particularly helpful whereas I've tried a LOT of other meds and find no results. I am also taking lamicital 200mg for BPD/PTSD.	10	January 23, 2020	72
Abilify (Intramuscular)	Bipolar Disorder	Have been on Abilify (Generic) for about a month now. My lows are higher and my highs are nonexistent. I’m mostly flat emotionally, lacking interest in everything, including people. Good for my irritability and delusions, but the side effects are tough.	5	January 19, 2020	34
Abilify Maintena (injection)	Schizophrenia	I was coerced into taking this injection at a mental hospital where I was told if I did not have it I would be in there for a long time. My only symptoms were depression and anxiety at the time of admission. It is a horrible drug it gave me anhedonia so lack of pleasure. I also had side effects to begin with like constipation and I passed out on. Also had racing thoughts and severe insomnia. AVOID this drug if you can it is awful.	1	March 24, 2021	2
Abilify Maintena (injection)	Bipolar Disorder	Abilify Maintena is the only medication that works for my bipolar I. The only noticeable side effect is decreased libido. Great for people like me who are not med compliant with pills.	9	February 2, 2021	3
Abilify Maintena (injection)	Schizophrenia	Went on an episode and relapse and took em away. BUT BE WARNED: it is like working out (as in going to the gym). You take the injection and then you work out your mentality because depression side effects start to kick in. Took away my passion for pretty much anything and I gained 15 pounds. Been on it for 5 months. But also remember that it is different for everybody. My sleep has been horrible but I still sleep for 10-14 hours a day. It makes you careless about your decision so you won't care about what you eat and you will eat a lot since you won't care.	1	September 13, 2020	14
Abilify Maintena (injection)	Bipolar Disorder	TOTAL MISERY FROM ABILIFY INJECTION 400 DOSE!  I had to find somewhere to sleep all day and then slept all night too! I immediately gained in 30 days, 30 lbs- they have gone straight to my waistline!  Abilify is the worst ever medication! My diagnosis- bi-polar disorder & schizoaffective disorder.  I was forced into a mental hospital, told that if I refused the meds, I wouldn't be released for 30 days and I could be released in 14 days if I consented. I didn't know there was an injection  too!  I would  have just waited it out had I known the ill effect that the Abilify injection 400 time release would have on my endocrine system!Totally ruined my lipids	1	August 25, 2020	13
Abilify Maintena (injection)	Bipolar Disorder	Been taking this injection Abilify Maintena for the past five months and have had no side effects. I started taking the pill form (with no side affects), but I get stubborn and ambitious and stop taking my meds. Plus, it’s sucks to take pills everyday. This has help dramatically. My mood is significantly better and, after many years (over five), I’ve finally stabilized. I see my doctor once a month and she gives me the shot. Only downside is the price. There are many ways to get around that though... just communicate with your doctor. I highly recommend this for treatment resistant depression and mood swings. Saved my life!	9	June 25, 2020	21
Abilify Maintena (injection)	Schizophrenia	I have to thank the people that comments on here,  I'm learning from your comments as a mother for a daughter.  Thank you.	8	May 23, 2020	17
Abilify Maintena (injection)	Schizophrenia	Double edged sword. Got rid of my psychosis but in return I have no personality/emotions.	6	April 9, 2020	19
Abilify Maintena (injection)	Schizophrenia	Been on arirpirzole for a year and half now, I cannot sleep, only getting about 3 hours a night, restlessness and spending money  My lifestyle is completely different from before might not seem it but I was aggressive and hearing voices also the TV would interfere with my actions. Now taking this medication I feel somewhat better, really I don't get my self in to so much trouble, like arguing and shouting, but now am calm and confident and can laugh again.	9	March 24, 2020	18
Abilify Maintena (injection)	Schizophrenia	Abilify Maintena has changed my life drastically in such positive ways. The AH, VH and TH are all gone, I am able to function without distraction of delusions, and can hold a steady job and take care of my children. I wouldn't be able to do any of this if it weren't for this injection.	10	March 13, 2020	30
Abilify Maintena (injection)	Schizophrenia	This med really hasn't helped my voices at all. I'd say at most it takes the edge off my anger. I had the typical side effects which were pretty bad but I also had what I thought was EPS, extrapyramidal side effects in the form of hand movements. Upon withdrawal of the med I experienced an explosion of tics both motor and vocal. I went back on the med and the tics were a bit better but persisted. They include inappropriate tics and are unpredictable. I'm not a fan of any of the antipsychotics, frankly, but I would be weary of the risk of movement disorders in this med.	1	February 26, 2020	13
Abilify Maintena (injection)	Schizophrenia	I’m on 400 mg shot for schizophrenia    NOS . I don’t recommend lowering the dosage because you get tolerance to it. I was very impulsive and erratic before going on this, I’m on disability so I could not even maintain working.  Doing much better thinking clearly and hardly side effects besides tired the first month that is all.	9	January 28, 2020	19
Abilify Maintena (injection)	Schizophrenia	been on some form of abilify injection for 4 years. I have never missed a monthly dose. Started 400mg for 2 years 300mg for 2 years and just got my first 200mg Jan 2020 for schizoeffective disorder . I will never be tapered off but the point in lowering is to maintain stability but at the same time control the insatiable  desire the meds give me to eat. Also to try and get back some of the energy the meds just simply take away - energy to cook , clean , and exercise. I have been trying different meds for 10 years and abilify is my preferred. After refusing those other antipsychotic meds that have literally been around forever , abilify injection seemed to be a happy medium and you don’t have to take a pill everyday (because I know I won’t). If you find being on an anti psychotic indefinitely is your reality , abilify makes things easier. With the injection lasting a month long , it’s very incognito and doesn’t remind you that you are being treated - like taking a pill everyday	8	January 2, 2020	14
Abilify Maintena (injection)	Bipolar Disorder	I’ve been given this drug 300mg by depot every month & am on a community treatment order, which means if I refuse I get taken straight into hospital. It stops psychosis in bipolar but comes at a price, no emotions, extreme tiredness sleeping 12-14 hrs a night so hard to work. I’ve lost my creative side, my sex drive, even my ability to cook. I just sit in a chair most of the time, gaining weight, I feel so sorry for my family, I’ve completely lost myself and the psychiatrist doesn’t seem to care..	2	November 13, 2019	21
Abilify Maintena (injection)	Schizophrenia	I have used the Abilify Maintena for 7-8 months. All the side effects have almost disappeared except for the anxiety. My psychiatrist has agreed to put me off of it. I guess the anxiety will wear off within a couple of months.	3	November 2, 2019	7
Abilify Maintena (injection)	Bipolar Disorder	Abilify 400mg injection at first made me so anxious and felt suicidal. My Dr's said it wasn't the drug it was my depression and anxiety. They persisted with it, as I'm not compliant with tablets. I have bipolar 1 with psychosis. It has helped with psychosis but the side affects are destroying me. Extreme lethargy and total numbness, physically, mentally and emotionally. It has made me gain weight also despite daily exercise. I have no libido whatsoever anymore.  When I complain to the psychiatrist  they just say it's not supposed to do that, there must be another reason for these things. I also feel like I have no memory but have  impulses to gamble and spend money. I have no energy to fight anymore, it's so sad and disgusting that my quality of life is not a factor to these people. Dr's etc.  As long as I'm not in the ward is all that matters to them.	4	October 13, 2019	17
Abilify Maintena (injection)	Bipolar Disorder	Major weigh gain. I feeling tired all the time, but on the other hand my moods have been completely stable. Except for focus which I was prescribed concerta for. It seems to be working :)	7	October 9, 2019	5
Abilify Maintena (injection)	Bipolar Disorder	I have been diagnosed with comorbid bipolar2 and ADHD.  It has been such a struggle, trying different cocktails. The reason I give abilify a 5, is because it had treated my bipolar2, have not had any manic episodes within the past 5 months I’ve received the 400mg injection, however I am started to feel that numb and empty feeling again (no sex drive and not many pleasant emotions either). It’s so miserable, I wish it was a faster process instead of having to wait until my next doctors appointment to tell him to take me off of this or at least lower my dose. From previous experience I do not stop a medication without consulting my doctor and I would highly recommend doing the same as it can lead to detriment in your life if you have manic episodes such as myself.  Right now though, I wish I could just stop it so I have more energy. I’m also on lamictal and Dexedrine. I won’t give up, and I hope that those of you struggling can remain resilient in your search for a cure.	5	August 25, 2019	6
Abilify Maintena (injection)	Bipolar Disorder	Before Abilify I was in and out of the hospital for years. They had me on olanzapine and it made me feel like a slug so I would stop taking it and end up back in the hospital because of manic attacks. They finally suggested this med for me and it has really worked! I don't feel manic, I can think clearly, I feel normal emotions and I have a decent amount of energy. The only side effect I had was that it made me feel sick for the first month every morning. It has really worked for me but you have a give it a month for it to actually work if you are on it.	8	August 3, 2019	13
Abilify Maintena (injection)	Schizophrenia	Has anyone developed hypersexuality like me?	7	July 18, 2019	16
Abilify Maintena (injection)	Bipolar Disorder	This stuff is ugly, it numbs all feelings and desires, I sleep for about 12 to 14 hours. The weight gain is crazy, sexual side effects too, I took this stuff for a year and a half, then stopped cold turkey, with no problem...I wouldn't recommend this Abilify Maintena or ever take it agin	1	July 10, 2019	16
Abilify Maintena (injection)	Schizophrenia	I shared my experience once already. But I need to share it again. It has been now 4 months I take abilify maintena. And with the help of the pill form, I feel like the side effects are really subsiding. I gained 20 lbs but at least I feel somewhat normal again.	8	June 27, 2019	13
Abilify Maintena (injection)		Since starting this medication on May 23, 2019, I have gained 14 lbs. That's approximately 1 lb. per day. Aside from the weight gain, this medication manages my Mania and keeps it at bay. It also has helped make me more myself, getting out and active like I always used to be.	8	June 13, 2019	9
Abilify Maintena (injection)	Bipolar Disorder	Starting in 2003 I have had problems. By 2009 it increased and my family finally took it serious when I tried to jump out of my mother's vehicle. 2012 I saw a new psychiatrist who finally got me stable on Abilify Maintena 400mg dose. It has been a miracle drug for me. Side effects suck but I can deal with the weight gain I guess. To counteract the fatigue I also take nuvugil and vyvance which I can sleep through these drugs that is how strong the fatigue is. But I am functional, happy, and no crazy wild thoughts. If I do have them they are not as strong and I tend to just shrug them off. I can tell the shot is working because at the end of the month I start getting irritable and sad and immediately when I take it I feel better. Oddly enough I cannot take abilify by pill form because it causes akathesia. I have tried every psychiatric drug there is and nothing has gotten me to where I am today expect Abilify Maintena	10	June 13, 2019	11
Abilify Maintena (injection)	Schizophrenia	I have been using Abilify Maintena for 2 months now.  I had very little problems with my illness to begin with but my psychiatrist decided to put me on it due to many trouble I have caused to some people a while ago.  The drug has had for me very little to 0 therapeutic effect.  In fact, now I have less motivation and a big social anxiety.  I was before on Xeplion (invega sustenna) and abilify is still a lot better than Xeplion because it has a lot less side effect.	6	May 7, 2019	8
Abilify Maintena (injection)	Schizophrenia	My fiancé has been taking meth for a long time. Ever since, he had sleeping disorder. Anxiety. Depressed.. Doctor suggested this injection abilify. Is there anyone here taking meth and tried abilify		May 1, 2019	11
Abilify Maintena (injection)	Schizophrenia	For my schizophrenia opted in for Abilify Mainena as an alternative to Invega Sustena. Granted that I was on Invega Sustena for between 6-12 months prior with bland emotions at that time, I did some research and gave Abilify Maintena a chance. That was late 2014. Now it's early 2019, and I want everyone to know that by this time, I have regained some emotional ability. I am also able to focus on complex tasks with a significantly better ability than I would be without an antipsychotic. I have concerns though. I have a physical standing job and I walk to work, and all I can do is maintain my weight within a 10 pound range. I felt good, and the Abilify Maintena kept me resilient when things got tough. For the record, I used to have suicidal thoughts long before starting Abilify Maintena, but I never contemplated it while on it. One last thing: I have always taken a low dosage of Abilify Maintena. I do not ever recommend medium or high dosages to start with.	8	March 15, 2019	22
Abilify Maintena (injection)	Bipolar Disorder	I've been on abilify maintena for 3 days.  I already feel better after being on paliperidone depot which made me depressed anxious and I had had dark  thought patterns.  Abilify has to be the better medication I've tried, I was diagnosed with bipolar in 2009.	8	February 3, 2019	7
Abilify Maintena (injection)	Bipolar Disorder	So where to begin. I love how this drug completely turned my life around in a really positive way. Used to have multiple manic episodes a year. I haven't had one in over a year after being on this drug. The reason I'm giving this an 8 as its incredibly effective as a mood stabilizer but it makes you too stable to the point of feeling numb at a high dose. Some minor weight gain thats slowly going away, and akathisia which is also slowly going away. I hope that the anhedonia will also slowly back off over time. Lets see. If I had to take this or be unstable I would take this. Also starting this was a nightmare as it made me incredibly agitated before it eventually stabilized my mood.	8	February 2, 2019	8
Abilify Maintena (injection)	Schizophrenia	So I've been on this Abilify Injection (against my will) for a couple of years because my family just wants me to be normal again. And man, do I feel normal! It's so great! (I was being sarcastic...really, really sarcastic) I can't sleep for more than a couple hours at a time, I suffer from persistent psychological pain due to anxiety/restless leg, and I have gained 70 lbs! And there's more! If I keep taking it, I'll probably wind up with diabetes! What a great drug to give a permanently disabled veteran to ensure that they live a long, peaceful life!    Seriously though...It's terrible. Low quality of life in exchange for little to no psychotic symptoms...Bad Trade. Find something else that works for your condition!!!!!!		January 11, 2019	13
Abilify Maintena (injection)	Schizophrenia	This drug is terrible. I can’t remember a thing. No desire or passion for anything. Stops my thought process almost entirely.  Very scary.	1	November 11, 2018	25
Abilify Maintena (injection)	Schizophrenia	I have been taken the drug for over a year now no side effects.	10	September 7, 2018	20
Abilify Maintena (injection)	Schizophrenia	I was put on this injection, after my insurance wouldn't cover any other injection other than prolixin. I was covered for this injection through the Prelapse Study. Now if anyone has ever been on Prolixin, you should know that the effect are extremely bad so being on Abilify Maintena was a god send.  It overall changed me completely to where I am functioning at a normal state, and haven't been in the hospital since I have been put on this injection.  I do have some side effect from the injection, which most notably is the uncontrollable muscle movments, which I am uncertain if this is unreleated to the drug itself or if I have a form of tourette's.   Also I did notice some uncontrollable urges in spending money/gambling, more than what I thought I would have normally done.  Overall to be honest, the benefits out weight the cons in my concern.	9	July 6, 2018	9
Abilify Maintena (injection)	Schizophrenia	I can't bare this injection. It make me zombie and not feel anything any emotion or any feeling of pleasure.	1	June 16, 2018	20
Abilify Maintena (injection)	Schizophrenia	This medications side effects are far worse then any good it does. If you don't mind sleeping all day , gaining weight , breaking out with zits , becoming a total zombie and doing nothing productive with your life at all this is the drug for you. Hearing voices is not so bad in comparison to how bad this drug makes you feel and the want to gambling your life savings away. The second the injection enters your blood you instantly feel greasy. This stuff is a total joke and has the power to turn a smart and clever individual into a total brainless slug.	1	April 5, 2018	30
Abilify Maintena (injection)	Schizophrenia	I have been on this medication for 3 months and it has worked for my condition (Schizophrenia) the voices are less frequent and I am able to live a normal life. 9/10	9	February 26, 2018	7
Abilify Maintena (injection)	Bipolar Disorder	This is my story. 20 years ago I developed clinical depression possibly bipolar. That was bad enough but the change in brain chemistry plunged me into immediate/overnight alcoholism.   Nothing worked for 20 years. This drug cured my alcoholism.  I am a normal drinker now.  I have no idea why this drug cured my alcoholism but it did.	10	January 19, 2018	10
Abilify Maintena (injection)	Bipolar Disorder	It's not for me 6 weeks on and cannot wait till it's out my system. Makes me feel  like I can't  stay in one place too long. It has ruined my sleep and has made me unsocial. I am not saying it's a bad drug just not for me......	1	January 8, 2018	12
Abilify Maintena (injection)	Schizophrenia	I have been taking this drug for a year now and its finally stopped the psychotic episodes I was having. It works for me anyway.	10	November 12, 2017	8
Abilify Maintena (injection)	Schizophrenia	This medicine provided so much hope regarding the struggle to find ANY medicine that would help the combative nature of schizophrenia. Only ABILIFY MAINTANA injection has improved my sons thought processes.  He has been less delusional more lucid for the first time in 12 years , The anger and frustration of daily life has calmed. It truly is life changing.  I pray that this medicine can help billions more angry raging delusional young men and young woman .  Thank goodness for this INJECTION being on the market for this sad disease that has ruined so many lives in the past . Now I have hope going forward for all diseases that rob the mind and thoughts of many persons . Thank you 	10	July 19, 2017	20

Abiraterone	Zytiga (abiraterone)	Diagnosed 5 months ago with Prostate Cancer, Stage 4, with Gleason 10, bone Mets almost everywhere. Had radiation to save femur neck and hip involvement. 10 treatments with lupron every 3 months and daily Zytiga and prednisone since diagnosis, I went from a psa 60 to .01. All other numbers thankfully good as well. Side effects have been somewhat cumulative: manageable fatigue, muscle loss and 14 lb weight gain around my waist. Through it all I walk about 30-35 hilly extra miles per week, and lift light to medium weights 2-3 days per week.  74 yrs old. Biggest challenge  is maintaining muscle strength and combatting malaise. Weight work is absolutely essential for me.  I try hard to stay focussed and not take a nap til the afternoon. Then a cup of tea and find a chore. Helps fight depression by accomplishing some little thing. All in all, Zytiga a miracle drug for me.	10	July 25, 2020	16

Abiraterone	Zytiga (abiraterone)	Started taking 1000mg of Zytiga almost 3 weeks ago but having difficulty with weakness and pain in legs; it got so bad I was unable to walk.  I was also extremely tired, but not sure if that is from Zytiga or morphine I need to take also.  My prostate cancer found in Feb 2011, Gleason score 9/10; prostate removed May 2011; radiation in 2014, then tumor found in 2018.  Started Lupron in 2019.  My PSA score was never above 4.0 even prior to surgery when it was in 75% of prostate and had spread outside my prostate in several places.  Hoping to switch to another medication that has fewer side effects for me.  I am only 65.	1	May 13, 2020	8
Abiraterone	Zytiga (abiraterone)	Started on Xtandi with 4 pills.  After 6 months, broke out into rashes and had trouble standing at the knees due to Xtandi.  Now on Zytiga for 3 months.

Abiraterone	Zytiga (abiraterone)	I am 69. Was diagnosed with prostate cancer 10 months ago with PSA of 68%. I had the MRI which showed that the cancer had metastasised. Oncologist recommended Zytiga but, where I live (Hong Kong) it costs about HK$30,000 per month. Can't afford that.  A medical friend suggested I try India. I did a lot of research and asked friends in India for recommendations and found a supplier at a good price for the generic.  I have been taking the generic (Arbiterone - 4x250 micrograms  +2 tabs of Predisnone per day) for the last six months.  Within two months my PSA was down to 9% and was still at that level three months ago. Side effects – hot flashes, night sweating, and weight-gain. Urologist suggested Clonidine for the hot flashes – worked really well. I see my doctor again in three weeks' time. He is looking into Olaparib (also called Lynparza) and Ivermectin for me.	9	October 17, 2019	26

Abiraterone (Oral)	Zytiga (abiraterone)	Diagnosed 5 months ago with Prostate Cancer, Stage 4, with Gleason 10, bone Mets almost everywhere. Had radiation to save femur neck and hip involvement. 10 treatments with lupron every 3 months and daily Zytiga and prednisone since diagnosis, I went from a psa 60 to .01. All other numbers thankfully good as well. Side effects have been somewhat cumulative: manageable fatigue, muscle loss and 14 lb weight gain around my waist. Through it all I walk about 30-35 hilly extra miles per week, and lift light to medium weights 2-3 days per week.  74 yrs old. Biggest challenge  is maintaining muscle strength and combatting malaise. Weight work is absolutely essential for me.  I try hard to stay focussed and not take a nap til the afternoon. Then a cup of tea and find a chore. Helps fight depression by accomplishing some little thing. All in all, Zytiga a miracle drug for me.	10	July 25, 2020	16

Abiraterone (Oral)	Zytiga (abiraterone)	Started taking 1000mg of Zytiga almost 3 weeks ago but having difficulty with weakness and pain in legs; it got so bad I was unable to walk.  I was also extremely tired, but not sure if that is from Zytiga or morphine I need to take also.  My prostate cancer found in Feb 2011, Gleason score 9/10; prostate removed May 2011; radiation in 2014, then tumor found in 2018.  Started Lupron in 2019.  My PSA score was never above 4.0 even prior to surgery when it was in 75% of prostate and had spread outside my prostate in several places.  Hoping to switch to another medication that has fewer side effects for me.  I am only 65.	1	May 13, 2020	8
Abiraterone (Oral)	Zytiga (abiraterone)	Started on Xtandi with 4 pills.  After 6 months, broke out into rashes and had trouble standing at the knees due to Xtandi.  Now on Zytiga for 3 months. Had dry skin around neck and hands.  Took skin cream which knocked down the dry skin.  Starting to have knee problems again. Xtandi and Zytiga both weaken your bones.  PSA dropped from 17 to 3.7.  Had Prostate Cancer for about 13 years.	8	April 21, 2020	14
Abiraterone (Oral)	Zytiga (abiraterone)	I was diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer in March of 2017. My PSA was at 23. After taking 6 chemo treatments and hormone shots my PSA went to .05. It gradually went up slightly to .27 and that’s when I went on zytiga. That was in January of 2019 and my psa immediately went to less than .03. After nearly 12 months my psa is holding steady at< .03. All with no side effects!   it’s working for me!	10	December 19, 2019	27
Abiraterone (Oral)	Zytiga (abiraterone)	I am 69. Was diagnosed with prostate cancer 10 months ago with PSA of 68%. I had the MRI which showed that the cancer had metastasised. Oncologist recommended Zytiga but, where I live (Hong Kong) it costs about HK$30,000 per month. Can't afford that.  A medical friend suggested I try India. I did a lot of research and asked friends in India for recommendations and found a supplier at a good price for the generic.  I have been taking the generic (Arbiterone - 4x250 micrograms  +2 tabs of Predisnone per day) for the last six months.  Within two months my PSA was down to 9% and was still at that level three months ago. Side effects – hot flashes, night sweating, and weight-gain. Urologist suggested Clonidine for the hot flashes – worked really well. I see my doctor again in three weeks' time. He is looking into Olaparib (also called Lynparza) and Ivermectin for me.	9	October 17, 2019	26

After first four weeks PSA dropped from 101 to 5.8 and after 8 weeks of initial date PSA dropped to 0.66. Today I feel very healthy exactly three years with the greatest consideration for Abiraterone Acetate. Very powerful chemo drug.	10	March 15, 2018	61
Abiraterone (Oral)	Zytiga (abiraterone)	Between zytiga and hormone injections, the spread of my cancer has slowed right down to almost no growth at all.

I had trouble with slobbering while I ate or talked much and that has lessened but continues.  It has been a miserable experience.

Abraxane	Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer	My husband, who is 74 years old, suffers from lung and trachea cancer. He receives three Abraxane infusions in three consecutive weeks. The reaction was brutal. You could say he had all the possible side effects and then some. Almost 2 month after treatment and after two hospital admissions, one of them in Intensive Care, he still feels extremely weak. Hard to believe that a medication supposed to help you live, can almost kill you. I also want to mention the extremely high cost of Abraxane. We end up paying a deductible of $2500 and we have Humana Medicare. Three treatments cost the staggering amount of $13500.	1	September 21, 2018	6
Abreva		I've had herpes simplex for as long as I can remember. I get at least 1-2 outbreaks a year and it always springs up in the fall and the spring.  I always put Abreva on the area as soon as I feel some tingling going on. Anyone who gets cold sores knows the feeling I'm talking about. The little stabby pain that tells you something viral is happening. I put Abreva on the affected area every hour. A thick layer to keep the lips moist and to numb the area a little.   Most of the time, Abreva keeps me from getting a terrible outbreak that spreads. It will keep the cold sore mostly under the skin, so I don't have any weeping or crusting. It really is a miracle cream for me.	8	April 26, 2021	0
Abreva		I have used Abreva for years and it seems to work well for me. Caution here, is that you must use it at the sign of a cold sore, to relieve the itch and not touch the area. It works very quickly (overnight), if applied to a sore that is already drained. As someone mentioned, it would be nice if the medication could be made transparent	10	April 15, 2021	0
Abreva		I never have had a cold sore in my 57 yrs but strangely enough I got one on the right side it went away with some vasoline.  But then I got another on the left side of my mouth.  I mean REALLY!!!!!!  From never to two in weeks.    So I decided to get Abreva...... well, it’s been 5 days and nothing has changed.  I didn’t wait till it was advanced stage.  I caught the second one ASAP.  I can’t believe I wasted $19.00 on this garbage.    I’m gonna break out that vasoline once more.  I can’t believe what a lousy product that’s so costly turned out to be!  Waste of time and money!!!!	1	March 25, 2021	0
Abreva		My cold sure isn’t really a sore. It’s usually tiny bumps, they a barely noticeable but I can feel them when I lick my lips and look very closely in the mirror. As I said they aren’t noticeable or sore like so I usually just let them run it’s course. This particular breakout started to spread. I purchased abreva and it made it worse and it spread even more and some of the bumps are very noticeable. I think I can conceal it with a colored gloss but I’m upset. I’ve never had a outbreak like this and I believe the Abreva was the cause of it.	1	March 13, 2021	0
Abreva		If you use it early, Abreva works great. Normally, a cold sore will last for two weeks, but with Abreva, I can completely bypass the blister. But it’s like the virus is smart and sometimes tries to come out in a different place. If you stay on top of it, you can keep it from forming.	10	March 9, 2021	2
Abreva		So in my early 20s the medication Abreva did work but now I'm  in 30s and it makes it  worse than ever, now I just use Lysine once a day to prevent eruptions and it is way much better :)	1	March 6, 2021	1
Abreva		I’ve never had any luck with Abreva. I’ve always been jealous of those who have, but it just doesn’t do anything for me. Often, it seems to make it worse. I have always used it exactly as the directions indicate- ASAP, don’t smear it, dab it (to prevent spreading), and make sure to wash the container and your hands. Regardless, this just doesn’t work for me.   What I do find helps, if I can’t get a prescription of valtrex, is to ice the site as soon as I feel a tingle and to take L-lysine 3x/day. Lysine won’t cure cold sores but it stops the virus from replicating. Most of the time, it never breaks the surface if I’m quick on my toes and when it does, it only lasts 3-4 days as opposed to the week or longer it would take to run a course on its own.	2	February 15, 2021	1
Abreva		I use Abreva as soon as I think I am getting a cold sore but I also take Lysine tablets at that time. Do some research about Lysine before you take it, see if it works for you. If a cold sore actually still surfaces, (not too often), then I keep using the Abreva as a barrier to keep the cells from spreading. I keep the ointment on only the cold sore and never rub it in or smear it. That will only cause more cells to become more infected. Hope this helps someone.	6	February 5, 2021	1
Abreva		Have tried Abreva a few times. Never works. This last time I applied it right away when I started to feel the itch and tingling. As others have said I got the biggest blister ever and it spread super fast. Took over a week to even get some relief. My sister  who also gets them has tried Abreva before and said the same thing. Doesn't help at all. Also way overpriced for no results.		January 13, 2021	2
Abreva		Used Abreva for the first time at the first sign of a coldsore.  I ended up with the biggest ugliest coldsore I ever had.  Horrible!	1	January 2, 2021	3
Abreva		The negative reviews are wild to me. I've been using this for 20 years. I don't get them often enough to use the same tube twice, but the moment I feel even the slightest tingle, I am at a pharmacy within 10 minutes buying this. It works if you use it RIGHT away. The giant blister clump won't form. That is exactly how it is advertised. If the blisters have already formed, it will be as effective as mayonnaise, just go ahead and cancel your plans, you're done for a couple of weeks.	10	December 27, 2020	6
Abreva		I agree with the first few I've read.  Abreva does NOT work and its WAY overpriced.  Been to see the doctor who gave me valtrex for the cold sores and said to use Abreva topically also.  Guess what? Months later I still have them.  I've experimented and neither works, either together or on its own.  No matter what I do it never develops beyond a blister, just kind of ebbs and flows in severity. I'm so frustrated I could scream.  Been fighting the dang things for almost a year now.  Ridiculous that there isn't something out there that works.	1	October 5, 2020	6
Abreva		Abreva either makes more sores appear, or gives me another outbreak right away. Bad stuff. And expensive!	1	September 28, 2020	7
Abreva		"If you already have blisters or lesions, go to the doctor... do not buy Abreva. Just like you, I hoped it would fix the problem in 2 1/2 days as advertised and didn't really have time for a trip to the doctor's office. I wasted $30 and prolonged my face deformity by relying on Abreva. New blisters actually popped up after I started using it! Only after I got proper anti-virals did the blister (and its Abreva friends) begin to heal. The doctor actually told me, ""I've never had much luck with patients who use Abreva."" Get anti-virals if you need to show your face in public anytime soon."	1	August 31, 2020	8
Abreva		This sucks. Don’t waste your money, it makes it worse. Every. Single. Time.	1	August 22, 2020	5
Abreva		I had been getting terrible cold sores on the outside wrapping to the inside of my nostrils for the last 10 years. Every six months or whenever I would get a cold and wipe my nose excessively, I would get one. They were painful and embarrassing and just overall gross. I have had three doctors who have given me all types of meds for it. None worked. My cold sore would last 11 days no matter what. None of my doctors mentioned abreva. One day I had a break out and my husband (on a whim) grabbed me some abreva. I applied it right away and my cold sore only lasted four days instead of 11. I apply it every time I have an itching or burning sensation where I used to get cold sores and I HAVE NOT GOTTEN ONE SINCE. I highly recommend this product.	10	August 21, 2020	5
Abreva		I’ve been getting fever blisters for years, usually 1-2x a year now and I’m fairly good at getting them to die down within 2-5 days. I see a lot of negative comments about Abreva, I decided to try it because I really need this blister gone QUICK this time. I started using it in the first stage of a little bump yesterday - along side lysine rich foods ONLY during my outbreaks, extra lysine supplements and my valacyclovir - with my whole regimen my blister has already began to shrink and crust over within 24 hours - making this the quickest time I’ve made it basically disappear and I think a huge part of that is the Abreva I added to the mix.   You cannot solely rely on medication to aid in your outbreak - you must also watch your diet, your stress levels and any triggers - such as heat, wind, sweating - anything that can irritate the virus infected cells must be avoided or the medications are just a weak band aid.	10	May 29, 2020	13
Abreva		$25 for a minimal amount and it took just as long to heal as if I had not used anything. It would be nice if the price would reflect the usefulness of this product.      	1	May 7, 2020	8
Abreva		I've gotten fever blisters all my life, and so around 3rd grade I started to use abreva and it honestly helps tremendously with the pain but not so much with actually getting rid of the cold sore. I've found that using hand sanitizer works great with taking it away tho. it dries it up in 2 days tops if you apply it often enough. obviously don’t cover your whole mouth with it tho cuz your lips will get crusty lol. but this combination really works for me so I thought I’d share.	4	March 13, 2020	3
Abreva		Every few years I seem to forget why I quit buying abreva.   Normally my coldsores last 3-4days, don't get very big etc. . But EVERY SINGLE TIME I give abreva a try, 1 small bump turns into 5 or 6 huge blisters so bad I can barely talk .  Literally have only had that happen when using abreva.  I don't know why I keep going back to it. It's horrible.	1	March 10, 2020	18
Abreva		I started using the very first day I felt that tingle and within 4 days I had another blister, and then just as the first one was starting to clear up, along came a third. It’s been 7 days since I started using this product and I now have 3 blisters that don’t look like they’re going anywhere soon. I’m so disappointed.	1	March 8, 2020	14
Abreva		I get cold sores usually once or 2x a year and used abreva and it only made it worse, it would grow and just be embarrassing,  so I've stuck with ACV	6	February 24, 2020	7
Abreva		Hi! French Horn player here, and also cold sore sufferer. For those who don't know, playing any brass instrument with a cold sore is the worst thing ever. It bursts open, and you cannot take 2 weeks off for a simple cold sore especially when preparing for performances. So, usually my cold sores last longer because they are not given a fair chance at healing. I started feeling the first signs and we have a big performance coming up, so I finally gave in and bought generic brand abreva. I can't recommend this enough. It's the weekend (so no playing) and it's been 2 days since its appearance, and the cold sore is already in the final stages (scabbing and healing) (side note: I have also been taking vitamin D and C because its prime flu season so maybe that is helping, unsure). Now, I will say that the blister forms much faster when you apply it right away, however the sore doesn't get as big, and within a couple days is healing. I have been applying 3-4 times a day. Seriously try it.	10	February 24, 2020	4
Abreva		Does not stop the blister from growing (Use Valtrex for that) but, put it on at first sight of blister and put on 5 times a day for several days.  It definitely helps heal the blister faster!  I was amazed at how quickly my blister healed	9	February 5, 2020	2
Abreva		58-yr-old male w/near 50 yrs experience w/cold sores! When I was young my mom insisted on kissing me; seeing that “thing” on her lip I resisted. Ever since? Cold sores. Who knew better in 1970?. Started w/my own home remedies (using softened underside of bar of soap to gather that 'cream'; worked somewhat.) Tried other concoctions.  Then in 2000, Abreva! Used properly, works like magic elixir. After showering, washing your face, need to re-apply. Being allergic? Can't predict that. Don't use it once you learn that.  Key: apply upon FIRST notice of tingling. Then, you NEVER GET THE COLD SORE!!! Be sure to apply every few hours, just a little, for a couple days, even a couple applications AFTER tingling stops. You'll end up using about 1/5 of tube; careful with the 1st 'squirts' – it'll come gushing out. Now, generics out there aplenty. Make sure they have 10% docosanol – the active ingredient that does the work. Go with whatever generic is cheapest. No more than $8/tube today.	9	January 29, 2020	6
Abreva		This is my first outbreak. The pain is unbearable. Started using abreva and I feel like it just made my sores worse and it also caused them to get bigger. Now I have two huge scabs that look absolutely disgusting. I wonder if leaving it alone would've been a better option.	4	January 22, 2020	14
Abreva		I swear I am experiencing the same thing with the Abreva pump! I’ve used the tube , no problem, so I  got a tingle, got the pump...& BOOM , the worst cold sore ever, it swelled , oozing & spread, also little hive like bumps on top lip as someone else stated. I went to the Dr. yesterday & was told I had an allergic reaction was given 2 shots one predinisone the other Benadryl....sent home with a script for both to take in pill form. The swelling went down some it’s been about 24 hrs but the blisters are weeping and so am I. I’m just going to finish my meds, scrap the Abreva & continue with tee tree oil, aloe & original Neosporin..... after ready these comments I’m glad I know I’m not crazy.	1	January 14, 2020	9
Abreva		I used Abreva when I was younger and it really helped a lot. Now I recently saw a fever blister on the corner of my lip so I went and bought Abreva right away and applied it to both sides of the corners of my lip. The next morning both corners of my lip was super swollen and there were several blisters!!! I couldn’t even close my mouth without being in such pain.  Definitely won’t be ever using Abreva again. Very expensive and I can’t even go out in public like this!	1	January 11, 2020	11
Abreva		Abreva really works for me.  I’ve tried every other suggestion out there for the past several decades, to little avail.  It must be used IMMEDIATELY upon the first tingle, HOWEVER, and several times per day, and more often if it gets washed off in the shower, or after eating.  Rarely now do my cold sores get out of control for weeks on end.  When I catch them early, and I happen to have Abreva at hand, I’m looking at 3 or 4 days max to keep it down or essentially invisible.  I find that I still have to treat new ones that may try to pop up in close proximity, but that holds true whether you use Abreva or not.  Keeping it down and treated also avoids serious scabbing, cracking, bleeding, which can all add days or weeks in additional healing time.  Don’t give up people, it’s probably the best thing out there if caught early.  Sure, some breakouts are worse than others, but Abreva is still my best buddy.  I keep it at hand always, at work, and bring it with me whenever I travel.	10	January 3, 2020	6
Abreva		Abreva takes some of the pain away and helps in healing but then I notice that I will get another outbreak worse than the first one a few weeks later. This never happened until I started to use Abreva, It happens every time. No more Abreva for me!!!	4	December 31, 2019	5
Abreva		Totally useless for me, does not shorten the time of the cold sore, just adds another conspicuous embarrassing white blob to your lip...great.	1	December 24, 2019	10
Abreva		So i have suffered from cold sores for years. I finally decided to give abreva a try. So yesterday morning I woke up and could feel the tingling started, so when I left the house that morning I had a red spot starting to form, stopped and got abreva applied it right away. Rubbing it in, followed the directions ALL day (ended up applying 4 times) a small blister (rare normally a good size blister forms in a day or 2 for me) formed.  When i woke up next morning blister was already scabbed and was about 1/4-1/8 size of normal blister I get, only small amount of tingling remains, very happy and will TOTALLY use again and recommend....	10	December 21, 2019	1
Abreva		Okay peeps here's the thing, cold sores don't always act the same way every time. It's possible that you are used to it looking a certain way every time it appears (like a small circle) but years later it can make you look like you got punched in the mouth and then go back to a small circle like you are used to. It's not the product that makes your cold sore worse unless you have an allergic reaction to the chemical make up of the product but that would result in hives. Abreva is a great topical option to use ALONG with other treatment. There are medications you can use to cut the cold sore short. Do a little research and talk to your doctor to see about getting a script.  In my opinion Abreva isn't strong enough to deal with the cold sore on its own; but it is definitely beneficial when you use it along with medication.	8	December 8, 2019	12
Abreva		Started using abreva last year for cold sores and it works, it is the closest thing to a cure I've come across. I can completely bypass a cold sore if used at first sign. Is also instrumental to the way I treat a cold sore	10	December 1, 2019	4
Abreva		Abreva has worked for me every time.   If you use it at first sign, and rub it in until the product disappears every time you use it, it will stop the virus from growing and spreading.  My outbreaks are gone in 3 to 4 days.   If you dab it on and don’t rub it in, it won’t work.  If you use it after the blister has begun to form, it won’t work.   Also, even if you use it at first sign, the blister will form, but it won’t be as big.	9	November 17, 2019	12
Abreva		Abreva was used at the very beginning before I even felt a tingle. I used it and it spread the cold sore terribly. Now I have two outbreak spots which is very rare for how I get them. Never buying this again. Con product that doesn’t do anything but make it way worse.	1	November 17, 2019	12
Abreva		So unfortunately I have had cold sore outbreaks for years. I hate the stigma attached to them. But I've always used Abreva. From the pump or the tube. Both worked great... However.....this time I'm currently laid up in bed unable to speak because my cold sore has literally multiplied into several little bumps it's incredibly painful to do anything and my lip look so swollen I feel like I was punched in the lip. I don't know what happen to Abreva but it use to be good. This time has almost got me wanting to go to the hospital 	5	November 16, 2019	18
Abreva		Best product ever for a cold sore.  This product has always reduced the size of and time of any cold sore I've had!	10	November 16, 2019	2
Abreva		Wow...I have had just the opposite of some of the other comments.  I have had terrible cold sores all my life....and  Abreva is the best I have found to lessen the pain and start the healing, and keep the cold sore from growing to a big mess.  It has also shortened considerably the painful week or two of a cold sore.  It doesn't work overnight, but being consistent over a couple of days works wonders!  I will definitely use it every time!	8	November 6, 2019	6
Abreva		Vitamin C. Make it your best friend. It binds to the water in your body not your blood so you have to take it consistently. They call them “cold sores “ because your immune system is compromised while you have a cold so it gives the virus a chance to break out. It sucks. I get mine on my nose and hurts terribly.	1	November 5, 2019	7
Abreva		I take Abreva to shorten the duration of cold sore symptoms. I haven't found anything that works better. I will still get the cold sore, but if I treat at first sign, it's much less of a big deal than years gone by.  It also seems to work better if you take care of sleep, nutrition and stress as best you can. The virus is after all, opportunistic.	8	November 4, 2019	3
Abreva		Ok... Guys... This cream may work only at the very beginning of this awful sickness hahaha... Was reading the reviews... Found this salt water recipe which works.  Seriously it burns your lips but it is good. You see I applied this cream many times but it only worsen my condition. My blister was getting bigger. Till I made a very strong salt water mix and washed my mouth with it couple times. My blister skin peeled off.  Ou yea. You betcha. It works. Couple more times and I'm all good... Try it!		October 31, 2019	12
Abreva		I had a tingle on my lower lip and felt a bump forming. I decided to get Abreva because I’ve used it years before and it worked for cold sores. I always use Q-tips to apply and made sure no double dipping. BUT this time it made it 100x worse. Blister Bumps formed all over my bottom lip and spread to my upper lip and to the nose. I had to go to the doctor to get oral medication. Don’t ever use this product !!!!	1	October 27, 2019	11
Abreva		I thought I had a cold sore but I think it was actually just a crack at the corner of my mouth from dry skin. I started applying Abreva and began to get little red bumps around my mouth, mostly where I was applying the Abreva. The rash spread and now I have blistery red bumps all around my mouth, and a split lip. I will never buy this stuff again.	1	October 24, 2019	11
Abreva		I had 2 little bumps near the bottom of my lip.. I put abreva on it soon as I felt the tingling and saw the bumps starting. I went to bed and woke up the next morning. It now looks like I got punched in the mouth and I have about 7 bumps on my lip. This is the worst product I have ever used. Its 5 to 6 times the size it was before I went to bed.	1	October 23, 2019	10
Abreva		Used Abreva once prior (from the tube). Had some swelling but within three days everything seemed to be healed and back to normal. Used the new pump this time and, MY GOD, things have taken a turn for the worse. Sometimes, after being in the sun for hours and from not getting enough rest, I’ll develop super tiny blisters on the inside of my upper lip. I put Abreva (from the pump) on this time and used it as I did with the Abreva from the tube. NEVER AGAIN. My entire lip is swollen 10x it’s normal size. It now looks like I have a million tiny little bubbles in my lip that I am PRAYING do not surface. The original three little blisters are now 7-8 and are oozing. It hasn’t spread to my face or upper lip but seems to have spread across my entire bottom lip. I don’t know if it’s an allergic reaction or if the condition has worsened. Either way, I will not use this product again. I stopped using it completely for the past 24 hours thinking the symptoms would subside. I was wrong.	1	October 20, 2019	6
Abreva		Got a cold sore for the first time and decided to buy Abreva since they seemed like the best to heal fast. Worst decision ever! I used the cream for 10 days and my cold sore never got away, it actually got worst. Now it’s been 3 weeks and my lips are still a bit swollen and I have to go see my doctor since the cold sore keeps coming back. Don’t buy!	1	October 16, 2019	3
Abreva		Felt a slight tingle on my upper lip with no visible bump/blister.  Tingle went away within a few minutes. Just to be on the safe side, I applied Abreva. Immediately started itching and a bump appeared within 10 minutes. Another bump surfaced within an hour. Applied another dose and low and behold, I had a 3rd cluster of bumps forming within 6 hours. 20 of my smackeroos spent on something resembling a botched lip job. I know better. Every time I use this stuff- regardless of what stage my cold sore is in- it makes it worse. Every single time. But I want to believe in it. Not anymore. Today, I am over the false hope of Abreva and accepting of the fact that this OTC is wasted money and a detriment to the herpes healing process. Just threw it in the trash because it is garbage!!!	1	October 13, 2019	5
Abreva		Put it on immediately in the morning when I felt the tingles and by the end of the day it got bigger and spread and looks terrible, I will never buy abreva agian	1	October 12, 2019	3
Abreva		I’ve used this product during 3 out breaks on my lip. I’ve applied it as instructed and it hasn’t work at all. Literally made no difference. On the 5th day which was today, I actually developed a smaller eruption just below the original one. This being even as I was using the medication the whole time.	1	October 11, 2019	1
Abreva		This medication is horrible. I used it for a week with no results. I agree with others. I think it makes it worse.	1	October 11, 2019	2
Abreva		I usually get one cold sore a year and I tried Abreva for the first time earlier this year and it worked, but I got another cold sore on Sunday which never happens that I get twice in a year and this time it’s HUGE it was bad and I never had a coldsore like this until after I used Abreva so I’m pretty sad because I still used it again and it’s making it scab over quicker but still like I feel like it’s going to make my next outbreak worst. 		October 9, 2019	2
Abreva		This is my 2nd time using abreva the first time was not good but I thought it was due to not catching the first sign of my cold sore. So now I had the first sign of a cold sore and decided to really see if this product works. I used abreva and the next day my lip had more bumps and was more swollen. Just awful experience.	1	October 7, 2019	3
Abreva		1/3 cup of warm water and a full spoon of salt. Mix well. Swish around your mouth for about 30 sec. it will burn... a lot. Do this 3-4 times a day and I kid you not it’ll go away within 3 days. Painful but worth it	1	October 5, 2019	9
Abreva		Whenever I use the abreva my cold sore gets a lot worst... I don't know why. I always wash my hands before applying the product. Also, I don't like the new pump version. It pumps out a lot of product that ends up going to waste. Find another alternative!	2	October 1, 2019	4
Abreva		I had an outbreak for the first time. It started off inside my mouth & when those burst it appeared on the outer corners. I couldn’t get a prescription, so I got Abreva.   I used alcohol pads first to disinfect the area. Then I applied Abreva with a q-tip, only dabbing (not spreading). I used a new swab every time I went to a different area on my face. I followed with a mild lotion (q-tips again) & coconut oil.   I repeated this morning, night, & after every meal for four days. I got small bumps on my lips that lasted a day or so. I didn’t use chapstick & only applied anything with clean swabs. The corners of my mouth flared up after meals but calmed after the regiment. The blisters were so tiny that only I saw them.  Abreva worked for me but my lips feel stiff and puffy where I applied it. The blisters never popped, & I never got scarring or huge breakout. I believe the other experiences on the site, next time I’ll use something else and not push my luck with this product.	9	September 24, 2019	5
Abreva		"The product works. The packaging (pump bottle) doesn't work well at all. It""s difficult to get out the right amount. And the pump quits working, leaving product in the bottle."	9	September 20, 2019	5
Abreva		Just awful; I cried. I used Abreva at first signs of a cold sore, and within hours, my upper lip erupted into massive painful blisters that resembled a marble. I thought it was a fluke, so I gave it another shot next time. Same reaction; I'll never use Abreva gain.	1	September 17, 2019	9
Abreva		I got my first cold sore in May. Saw my doctor and he told me to keep using  Abreva  until it went away. Well, naive me used the Abreva for 3 weeks. I didn’t know exactly how the outbreaks usually went so when they spread across both my upper and lower lip, I didn’t realize it was the Abreva causing the mess; until they swelled up like balloons over night and my face became bumpy and itchy. I got a prescription for Valtrex and stopped Abreva immediately after that. However, my lips STILL are not 100% back to normal (4 months later). It’s like it mostly goes away for no more than 1-2 weeks before it comes back. The Valtrex helps, but there’s something else going on here. I’d like to know if anyone else has issues like me.	1	September 15, 2019	6
Abreva		I’m amazed at how many people have had the same experience with Abreva recently. I am convinced that the formula has changed. I get cold sores very infrequently but I have always had success with applying it at the first tingle or itch.  I have had two this year and applied immediately but ended up with full blown blisters and a puffy lip which has never happened to me before. Good to know it’s not just me...I was thinking my body had become immune.  I think I will need to look into other options at this point.	2	September 10, 2019	11
Abreva		I've used Abreva in the past it worked amazing. Normally I apply as soon as I feel the tingle but this time oh my goodness my face is so swollen. They must have changed the formula this stuff used to be amazing now it is garbage.	4	September 8, 2019	7
Abreva		I got my first cold sore in high school and my lip swelled up so big that I couldn’t talk. Well I’m out of college now and have tried to continue on using abreva and I’m not kidding when I say it makes my cold sore even worse if that’s possible! My lip will swell up so big that it splits and I break out into more sores if I use abreva. It will also take 2 weeks for the scabs to come off. My lip is so damaged and scarred now. I switched to a prescription topical and a oral cold sore medication. I also take Lysine every day and use Lysine ointment as lip balm as well. I use to only get them once a year and now I get them every 3-4 months. My advice is steer clear from abreva!	1	September 8, 2019	3
Abreva		I have had outbreaks since I was 7 years old. We all know that sinking feeling that comes with that lip tingle, or from waking up to a new sore. I've spent hours trying to find home remedies and determining triggers. Eventually, I started to rely on Abreva to help keep the lifecycle of an outbreak short. Fast forward 15+ years of Abreva use to today. I've had two outbreaks in the past year. Both times I reached for the Abreva, both times it got worse. Lots worse. Time to speak to my doctor about daily antivirals.	2	September 5, 2019	6
Abreva		Seems like this is purely psychological placebo.  I’ve had far more negative experiences (where I go to put abreva on early for a small bump and wake up with 5 full blown sores) than positive.  Looking at these reviews I can see I’m not alone.	1	September 4, 2019	4
Abreva		The worst product ever . I put it on my cold sore the day I saw it pop up it was tiny and now my symptoms just worsened and my blisters are HUGE not to mention every time I’d apply it it would burn and tingle like crazy. I WOULD NOT recommend	1	September 2, 2019	2
Abreva		Tried it three separate times. Same thing happened. Produced a larger outbreak than leaving it alone. This product should be relabeled at Herpes fertilizer.	1	August 29, 2019	12
Abreva		Abreva does work when used correctly. Also, Valtrex plus Abreva can prevent any further outbreaks. As soon as I feel my lip tingle I take a Valtrex and that usually gets it. Sometimes it doesn't and I have to use Abreva. I had an outbreak at work this morning. I panicked, but I took my Valtrex and didn't touch it until I used my abreva. What started out as bubbly bumps are now smoothed out and I'm just on 1 day application of it.	8	August 28, 2019	4
Abreva		I usually use an orajel product and it seems to work. So a they didn't have it in stock. I seen abreva and had only heard great things. I had a tiny little bump I put on the abreva and went to bed now wake up with over a half dozen and it is awful. Thank you abreva	1	August 25, 2019	2
Abreva		Don’t waste your money!!! I applied the product Abreva correctly only for it to make more cold sores appear.	1	August 24, 2019	1
Abreva		I've been using this product on and off for about a year. Anytime I feel a flare up I'll pop a little bit of Abreva onto my lips underneath my lip balm and it INSTANTLY (or at least overnight) takes care of the issue!   My last flare up yesterday had resulted in a blister forming. I panicked as I thought it might be too late for the medication to work its magic most effectively but I applied anyway and within one day the blister popped and revealed nice soft lips underneath! Best of all, no further tingles or irritation.	10	August 22, 2019	3
Abreva		I got abreva because the commercials say it can heal a cold sore and as little as two and a half days I have been using it for a week my cold sore hasn't gone away		August 17, 2019	2
Abreva		I usually use abreva and it usually works for me but this time I used it at the first sign of my cold sore (as usual) and FIVE MORE CAME UP! So now it’s like I have 5 cold sores built up in one area on my face! Thank you abreva!	2	August 15, 2019	1
Abreva		I haven’t had this bad of a breakout since I first got cold sores and didn’t know what to do. Oh, and I also was taking antibiotics for it but I thought the abreva would help prevent scaring...OMG was I wrong! It’s SO SO much worse and I’m so miserable!!	1	August 11, 2019	0
Abreva		Same as everyone else. I used to use this product with great results but the last two times I've used it, my face blew up and got swollen, and the medication actually worsened the blister 10x what it normally is.   Worst medication ever. Do not use.	1	August 10, 2019	1
Abreva		I usually use tea tree oil and ice, but this time I asked my wife if I could use her Abreva.  This was on day two when I had either won the race with the oil and ice or lost. I thought I had lost. But, the oil and Abreva shrank the blister over night and after two days it is nearly gone.  I will use Abreva from now on.	10	August 9, 2019	2
Abreva		Similar to everyone else. In the past I've used Abreva and 3-4 days later the sore is well on its way to being healed. Now? My sore is massive. Biggest I've had in a decade. Absolutely not worth the 21 bucks. I'll go back to Herpacin and ride it out.	1	August 7, 2019	2
Abreva		Abreva worked before great in the past.  This time made it worse.  They must if changed the formula.	3	August 5, 2019	0
Abreva		I used abreva at the first signs of cold sore which I get infrequently. 2 days later the site was clearing up and I thought I was good, until several more fluid filled blisters erupted! That never happens to me. I usually use tea tree oil and coconut oil but thought maybe abreva would clear it up faster, I’ll be going back to my usual routine! Very disappointed!	1	August 2, 2019	3
Abreva		I put Abreva on as soon as I noticed the cold sore coming on and it got worse. I thought maybe I just didn't put it on soon enough, so I continued to use it. Now, three days later and it's huge, five blisters (which some are bleeding), and just horrific looking. They changed and now their product is awful. Don't waste your money.	1	August 2, 2019	0
Abreva		Doesn’t work at all. I applied it at the first sign and woke up with very a swollen lip and a cluster of super sore blisters.	1	July 31, 2019	3
Abreva		Since I discovered Abreva, I have only had an outbreak once in the last 16 years and that was my fault for not applying it soon enough. It works great but you have to always be on alert for a tingle or red warm spot. It will never materialize if so. I even put it on as a precaution when I know I will be in long meetings or outdoors for a long period of time time. It really won't work once a breakout begins. I always carry a tube in my wallet. It gets expensive but worth every penny to avoid a week of those hideous nightmares.	10	July 27, 2019	1
Abreva		I don't know what's wrong with all the other users rating this product poorly. Abreva ALWAYS heals my cold sores super fast. I suspect they are not applying it correctly? You have to use it several times a day. Basically, keep Abreva on your sore until it heals. If you only apply it once it's not going to work. My sores always heal within 3-4 days. I apply it as soon as I feel that tingle on my lip and it never erupts. It stays just a barely noticeable little bump.	9	July 26, 2019	6
Abreva		Much like others on this list, I applied Abreva at the first sign of a cold sore this morning. And what was 1 tiny spot on my upper lip has ballooned into a cluster of puffiness. I wish I had seen the other reviews before I applied it. I do not recommend this product.	1	July 24, 2019	1
Abreva		Wow! Crazy reading through all of these comments! I count myself lucky, I usually only get one blister a year in the spring as the weather heats up. This year I've been traveling a lot more for work to some warm dry climates. I've had to deal with them more than usual. I typically rely on valtrex however being on the road and running out of my prescription has caused me to turn to other methods. Fortunately abreva didn't make it worse but it certainly didn't help either. I heard great things about it in the past it's a shame that it no longer holds any value. Curious to learn how others deal with the annoying little blisters when in a pinch if valtrex isn't available or an option? Anyone have any recommendations?	1	July 18, 2019	2
Abreva		I just had an outbreak this morning and only got to the pharmacy this afternoon to buy the abreva which surprisingly was on special for $15.99 instead of $20.99. I put it on and within hours, and in comparison to earlier in the day the 3 little blisters were noticeably more swollen and bubbly. It's my first time using this product and I am truly disappointed given the rap sheet it had before. I'm looking for alternatives now.	3	July 18, 2019	3
Abreva		Ive been getting cold sores for 10 years now. I bought Abreva to help speed along the healing process. Its embarassing  having cold sores at work. Big mistake. I still have the cold sore and its even bigger and grosser. Without Abreva they're usually gone within a couple days. Throw it away... Do not buy this product. I quit my job because I was being treated poorly by my coworkers. Do not buy. Does not help cold sores at all.	1	July 15, 2019	1
Abreva		For the last three years I’ve gotten a cold sore in the summer time. Usually induced by stress and hormones and sunshine. This past week I felt the tingle on my lip and went to Walgreens immediately to get Abreva. It has worked in the past- drying up the sore and allowing me to move on with life. However, this time it made my cold sore way worse. It spread onto my cheek and to the other side of my lip. The product is so runny that it naturally spreads throughout your face when you go to rub it in. My face has been burning for two days now. I’ve been applying ice and warm towels to my face. I even took out my 800 my ibuprofen I was given 6 months ago for postpartum recovery because the pain was that bad. I spent a whole day with a headache and feeling all around ill. Needless to say, this product is a scam and needs to be removed from the market. Thank you to those who shared alternative ways for relief.	1	July 15, 2019	0
Abreva		Completely escalated my symptoms. I cannot believe this is happening! Stay away from this product!	1	July 14, 2019	2
Abreva		Abreva doesn't work! I'm not sure what's changed (their formula?) But I used to use it and be fine. Cold sore would heal and go away quickly. But now, it doesn't! It makes it 10xs worse!! I go from one tiny bump, put it on, and within 2 hours have tons going down from my lip. Now I have 8 little bumps. Ridiculous!!!	1	July 13, 2019	2
Abreva		I have used Abreva for many years with the tingling beginning of a blister on my lips. It has always worked exceptionally well. Recently I got a blister on my chin, while nothing on my lips. I put abreva on it and it did not respond at all like it had before. This time more popped up and it seemed abreva did nothing. My coworker had shingles at the same time and I am wondering if the blisters on my chin were slightly different than what I had had on my lips before?	9	July 6, 2019	0
Abreva		I've been using Abreva for about a year, they definitely changed the formula this time around. I put it on once, where in the past when I used it , it would just scab up, now it turns into about 12 sores, all down my lip, under my lip towards my chin, caused a burn on my actual skin, its tearing me up!  $18 a tube and its just adding to my sores and pain! These things are already embarrassing because people want to act like they're not common or whatever but they are common and I've seen children with them. This was the only stuff that worked for me and now here we go. Thanks a lot Abreva	2	July 5, 2019	2
Abreva		When I got my cold sore it was small I used this soon I got it. Later that damn day it was huge I had to go to the doctor to get cream.	1	July 4, 2019	1
Abreva		I've gotten cold sores since I was younger and they're always about the same until I bought Abreva last night, HUGE MISTAKE! It got so much bigger and extra blisters spreading onto my face under my lip.  Went to doctors today and she said that my cold sore had gotten severely infected.  She prescribed me valacyclovir 1G to be taken 3x daily for 7 days! DON'T EVER USE ABREVA!!!!!!!!	1	June 21, 2019	4
Abreva		I just joined the pool of unfortunate souls who fell victim to this harmful product. It's overpriced, the applicator isn't user friendly, and yes, it made the cold sore way worse than it's ever been before. I usually get these sores right after having the flu. Sometimes, they're barely visible. This time, I had one tiny little spot in the center of my lip. I applied the product generously to the entire area. The entire bottom lip blew up within a few hours. There needs to be class action lawsuit and a recall of this horrible product.	1	June 21, 2019	10
Abreva		ABREVA DOES NOT WORK!!! FDA needs to ban it from the market! If I could post a picture, I would! I agree with everyone else’s statements! Use Valtrex if you’re not allergic to it!  Attack unsightly cold sore blisters as soon as they appear with  Campho-Phenique Max strength! Throw away the Abreva in your drawer right now! Do it now! It does not work! I used it at the first sign of the tingle! 3 hours later, my entire left side of my lip was swollen and a large cluster of blisters were visible! Talk about embarrassing! We need to start a petition to get Abreva off the market! It is a scam!!!! Used a q-tip to apply it! Ha! The end result- a swollen upper lip that’s semi hardened on that side with multiple blisters! I have used in the past. I will say within the last 8-10 years, I believe they have secretly changed the formulation especially if you’re applying it at the first indication of a cold sore/ fever blister!		June 19, 2019	5
Abreva		I agree with everyone here that says it made their cold sore 10x worse. I get cold sores like once a twice a year and the last time I started to get one, I immediately applied abreva and the next day my lip was enormously swollen and spread to my bottom lip..I personally feel the best thing for cold sores Is to apply orajel for cold sores to it, ibuprofen for pain, benadryl for the itching and to use peroxide to clean it with cotton balls or just pouring it over affected area. Abreva is awful and not to mention ridiculously expensive!!	1	June 14, 2019	4
Abreva		They must have changed the formula?!?! I'm having the same awful experience most of you are. Felt the tingle  Ran to the pharmacy as fast as I could(drove) When I got there in the morning there was only the $40 2 pack and nothing else on the shelf?!  I didn't have a choice. Got it and it's the most massacistic way I've ever spent money. Put it on. Took a nap (keeping my face positioned up,) and woke up two hrs later to my lip swollen 4x the normal size. Three massive blisters spanned my lip after using this product. It used to help me in the past and now my worst nightmare has happened. I'm too embarrassed to go to work like this and can't concentrate on anything but the throbbing pain that feels like my lip will actually burst.	1	June 13, 2019	5
Abreva		I have used abreva multiple times and don’t feel that it’s helpful. It does make it more swollen but allows it the crust faster but drying it out.   I don’t use it anymore but strongly encourage people to ask their docs for valtrex. It’s a pill mediation specifically for herpes 1 or 2 - the virus that causes the blisters.   Works super well!!! I’ll have a tiny bump and take one pill and it’ll be gone the next day. It never gets bigger as long as I take it right away. The process is much more manageable and less embarrassing since it rarely ever gets to the scabbing stage.	2	June 9, 2019	4
Abreva		I get cold sores maybe once a year and usually just wait for them to go away on their own. Decided to try Abreva this time around. Worst mistake of my life. Within a few days of using the cream it had spread to a painful quarter-sized patch of fluid-filled blisters all over my upper lip and the skin below my nose. I've NEVER seen anything like it; it was so hideous that people would flinch when they looked at me (as I still had to go to work and have a life while this was going on). Took almost three months to heal, and I still have a scar from it. I don't know what they put in Abreva but stay away.	1	June 6, 2019	2
Abreva		Used abreva in the past and had no issues. This week I started feeling tingling on my face and went and bought a tube it’s been 3 days and my lip is now swollen and spreading. I’m happy to see I’m not the only one this happened to.  Definitely will never buy again and hope some of the suggestions on here will work for me and I can get rid of this embarrassing bubble on my face.	1	June 6, 2019	2
Abreva		After using Abreva during the tingling stage, my sore spread to other parts of my upper lip which has never happened before.  It's almost as if the drug is bottling up the virus and the virus explodes cause it has no where to go.  Whatever the reason, this is the worst outbreak I've ever had. Will try a different product next go around.	1	June 5, 2019	5
Abreva		Have had cold sores since the 60's. When Abreva first came out I bought some and it worked wonderfully. Not anymore and not at all. This is reflected in the reviews. Older ones are almost all positive and newer ones almost all negative. I believe the reason people are having sores explode, becoming the worst they have ever had is that it no longer has ANY of the active ingredient in the cream and when its applied it spreads the virus around without blocking it from entering healthy cells. I plan to call company and complain loudly and maybe the FDA as well.	1	June 4, 2019	8
Abreva		I wish I'd read these reviews before sending my husband to the pharmacy yesterday to buy me some Abreva. I get cold sores from time to time, and this time I decided to actually buy something to speed along the healing process. BAD IDEA. I applied abreva to my very small, barely noticeable cold sore yesterday afternoon. By bedtime, literally 4 hours after the first application, my lip was swollen to twice it's normal size and what started as a tiny spot is now dime sized. It literally looks like someone punched me in the face. Anywhere I applied the abreva broke out into a huge cold sore. My lip looks terrible and it hurts and itches like crazy. I am so upset!  What was supposed to help made everything significantly worse!! I should have just left it alone! I called the doctor and they are calling me in a prescription for Valtrex so that maybe this monstrosity will go away! I have never been so embarrassed. Seriously... This is the worst cold sore I've ever had in my life!	1	June 4, 2019	3
Abreva		I took Abreva and it made my cold sore worse !! It started with a small cold sore and I just wanted it to go away as I had an important event coming up so I rushed to go buy it. Instead it made my cold sore bigger and my lip is sooooo swollen. I try to do cold compress every couple hours but the swelling won’t go down. I watched some videos and they recommended apple cider vinegar . My cold sore is not in the drying up/ crusting stage bit my like is so swollen which makes it completely worse. I bought this item so it could help me not make everything worse. I definitely  deserve a refund !!!	1	June 2, 2019	3
Abreva		Used this once and I ended up with the worst cold sore I ever had.  DO NOT USE	1	May 29, 2019	5
Abreva		Abreva has not worked for me. I strongly recommend lemon balm. It’s cheaper than abreva and actually works. I put a few drops on a qtip and apply it for 10 minutes. I do this a few times a day and the cold sore is gone the next day. My cold sore last a day or two, rather than a week or more like it did before I used lemon balm.	1	May 20, 2019	5
Abreva		I had a tiny little sore on my lip yesterday and I used abreva and today it’s the size of a quarter reaching to my chin. I will not be using this again. Abreva made my cold sore worse!!!	1	May 17, 2019	4
Abreva		Ive tried Abreva, the CVS brand, and the RightAid brand  over the last 4 years. I've also put nothing on the cold sore.  My conclusion, is none of these over the counter medicines do anything to make the cold sore go away quicker.   At this point I've tried everything.  What has helped is the following;  as soon as you feel that first tingle in the lip, you have to immediately take Lysine pill and immediately put ice on it as often as you can.  This worked for me, and a couple times it completely stopped the sore from developing in the first place.  This last time I was lazy and waited over night to get ice and take the Lysine and it was too late.  It still will shorten the life of the cold sore but still will be around for about a week if you wait until the sore is present. Also Rubbing alcohol 6 times a day will dry out the sore quicker. it worked for me	1	April 28, 2019	0
Abreva		I have been getting severe cold sores since I was 6 years old. I was so excited the first time I bought this product when my lips were tingling and I knew they were developing even thought it was 5 times as expensive as blistex and Carmex. I used it faithfully.  By the next morning my lip was extremely swollen, 3 sores formed and I continued to use it 5-10 times per day.  No luck, they lasted 10 days with the same severity.  I have now used this product for two years hoping it will be different the next time.  It never is.  Unfortunately,  I am not sure what tests were performed to allow the FDA approval and claim that it heals faster.  I will go back to just using  Carmex and planning for 10 days of pain and embarrassment:(	1	April 19, 2019	4
Abreva		Exactly as others have said- I put it on at the first tingle. Used it religiously ALL day. This morning I woke up with TWO huge blisters, my entire lip swollen, and pain radiating down my jaw. I am 31 and have had cold sores since before I started kindergarten. Never in my life has a product caused them to WORSEN. Biggest mistake, and waste of money. I don't know what to use now.	1	April 17, 2019	4
Abreva		Abreva does NOT work. I've tried it numerous times and it's always the same result- nothing. I've had cold sores my entire life and the only thing that has ever worked was prescription valacyclovir (Valtrex). Don't waste your money or get your hopes up with Abreva.	1	April 12, 2019	1
Abreva		Never in my life experienced the WORST product ever. As soon as I started using the product next day it got worst, I have my lip super swollen and it actually spread all over the lip.  DON'T BUY IT!	1	April 8, 2019	1
Abreva		I’ve been getting cold sores for years, I was so excited I caught the cold sore this time when it was a tingle. I ran to the store, actually 3 because the first two were sold out of it, and bought some. I was recommended it by 3 friends. This is probably the second worst break out I’ve had in my life. I’m so sad. I’m two days in  working with the police academy, I’m a college student and it’s embarrassing. I had high hopes for Abreva. Maybe it works for some people but not for me. It actually spread off my lip onto my face and it has never ever done that before.	1	April 5, 2019	2
Abreva		Abreva works for me. Me being a minimal wage worker,  and break out every month.I CANNOT afford the twenty bucks every cold sore. This last pump I bought was all liquid and it ran out in a day!!! I cut it open and it wasn't near as big as the tube. I believe they are ripping people off.	1	March 29, 2019	4
Abreva		I get cold sores less than once a year which gives me time to forget how useless a treatment Abreva is for me - so I buy another expensive tube every time. I hope I remember to try something different next time instead of wasting my money.	1	March 26, 2019	3
Abreva		I came here to read other reviews after buying my first tube of Abreva. Should have read the reviews first. Within hours of feeling the first symptom of a blister coming on I bought Abreva on my way home after work. Biggest mistake of my life. I usually use Camphonique. Or something along the lines. Might have spelled it wrong but nope.  Decided to try the big name brand and waste twenty dollars thinking this has got to work and I caught it so early on all proud and what not. My damn lip is so swollen. And I thought maybe this is a normal reaction and the swelling will go down. After 2 whole days I've had enough. Went back to my camphor and the swelling went down within the hour. So mad at myself for not reading reviews before hand.	1	March 25, 2019	6
Abreva		Don’t use Abreva! Used Abreva for one week and my blister got worse!	1	March 20, 2019	3
Abreva		I have had a few cold sores in my life and after using Abreva I can safely say it made the cold sore the worst I’ve ever had! It is literally half the size of my lip this time around. I noticed after applying the cream it would spread to wherever the cream touched. I believe this was intentional for you to buy more cream. All of my previous cold sores were 1/8th the size of this monster. I stopped applying Abreva and it stopped spreading immediately.	1	March 16, 2019	5
Abreva		Felt a cold sore coming on, so went to get something for it. I was a bit put off by the price of Abreva, but I was helping teach a course in a few days and really wanted to get it under control. Not only did abreva not work, but I got a second blister in another spot! By far, the worst cold sore(s) of my life!! A wasted $20 for sure!	1	March 15, 2019	6
Abreva		I have been using abreva for some years now and when it was in the tube, it worked  great.  The new pump version is runny and has been virtually ineffective.  It has  changed and NOT IN A GOOD WAY!!!	2	March 10, 2019	1
Abreva		This product DOES NOT WORK! I’ve gotten cold sores for years, I would say maybe about 3 a year. While using abreva my cold sore spread and became more swollen. And while using abreva they can last up to two weeks. Go to a doctor and get a prescription for acyclovir or something similar. If I start taking this prescription right when I feel the cold sore, sometimes it doesn’t even develop or lasts about 1-2 days. For me, abreva just spread the cold sores and they last forever while using the cream!!!! I would just get a prescription for acyclovir and not even touch the cold sore at all.	1	March 6, 2019	0
Abreva		I have used Abreva for many years with lots of luck. Since I ran out I bought there newest container. Its slightly larger than it used to be and being kind of pricy that made me happy. What didn't make me happy and it doesn't work anymore. In fact it has made it worse. I had two back to back cold sores I applied multiple times per day and they are the biggest they have ever been. I'm convinced with the bigger tube they thinned out the product so much it doesn't work anymore. I even purchased a second bottle in the pump form to see if I had bought a bad batch and still nothing.	1	February 7, 2019	2
Abreva		Love this product.... I use it when I feel I am getting a cold sore and it helps to get rid of it before it starts..... love this product	10	February 6, 2019	2
Abreva		I typically get a cold sore once a year well I felt one starting to form and I had tried abreva before but it was already after the blister had popped so it didn't really do much. Well this time I wanted to try since I felt it so early on and the next day the cold sore was bigger and worse than I  have ever had before on my life so I continued to use it not thinking maybe it was the abreva having negative effects well now I have another cold sore forming at the corner of my mouth I have never in my life had 2 at once I will not be using it anymore hopefully they will cure up on their own. Not a good experience I see a lot of people everyday and this is embarrassing	2	January 31, 2019	4
Abreva		I never used abreva before, so I decided to try it. I applied it as soon as a felt the outbreak. This made it the WORST breakout I ever had. I highly recommend the Orajel vials, after 2 days of using them my cold sore went down significantly.	1	January 31, 2019	2
Abreva (Topical)		I've had herpes simplex for as long as I can remember. I get at least 1-2 outbreaks a year and it always springs up in the fall and the spring.  I always put Abreva on the area as soon as I feel some tingling going on. Anyone who gets cold sores knows the feeling I'm talking about. The little stabby pain that tells you something viral is happening. I put Abreva on the affected area every hour. A thick layer to keep the lips moist and to numb the area a little.   Most of the time, Abreva keeps me from getting a terrible outbreak that spreads. It will keep the cold sore mostly under the skin, so I don't have any weeping or crusting. It really is a miracle cream for me.	8	April 26, 2021	0
Abreva (Topical)		I have used Abreva for years and it seems to work well for me. Caution here, is that you must use it at the sign of a cold sore, to relieve the itch and not touch the area. It works very quickly (overnight), if applied to a sore that is already drained. As someone mentioned, it would be nice if the medication could be made transparent	10	April 15, 2021	0
Abreva (Topical)		I never have had a cold sore in my 57 yrs but strangely enough I got one on the right side it went away with some vasoline.  But then I got another on the left side of my mouth.  I mean REALLY!!!!!!  From never to two in weeks.    So I decided to get Abreva...... well, it’s been 5 days and nothing has changed.  I didn’t wait till it was advanced stage.  I caught the second one ASAP.  I can’t believe I wasted $19.00 on this garbage.    I’m gonna break out that vasoline once more.  I can’t believe what a lousy product that’s so costly turned out to be!  Waste of time and money!!!!	1	March 25, 2021	0
Abreva (Topical)		My cold sure isn’t really a sore. It’s usually tiny bumps, they a barely noticeable but I can feel them when I lick my lips and look very closely in the mirror. As I said they aren’t noticeable or sore like so I usually just let them run it’s course. This particular breakout started to spread. I purchased abreva and it made it worse and it spread even more and some of the bumps are very noticeable. I think I can conceal it with a colored gloss but I’m upset. I’ve never had a outbreak like this and I believe the Abreva was the cause of it.	1	March 13, 2021	0
Abreva (Topical)		If you use it early, Abreva works great. Normally, a cold sore will last for two weeks, but with Abreva, I can completely bypass the blister. But it’s like the virus is smart and sometimes tries to come out in a different place. If you stay on top of it, you can keep it from forming.	10	March 9, 2021	2
Abreva (Topical)		So in my early 20s the medication Abreva did work but now I'm  in 30s and it makes it  worse than ever, now I just use Lysine once a day to prevent eruptions and it is way much better :)	1	March 6, 2021	1
Abreva (Topical)		I’ve never had any luck with Abreva. I’ve always been jealous of those who have, but it just doesn’t do anything for me. Often, it seems to make it worse. I have always used it exactly as the directions indicate- ASAP, don’t smear it, dab it (to prevent spreading), and make sure to wash the container and your hands. Regardless, this just doesn’t work for me.   What I do find helps, if I can’t get a prescription of valtrex, is to ice the site as soon as I feel a tingle and to take L-lysine 3x/day. Lysine won’t cure cold sores but it stops the virus from replicating. Most of the time, it never breaks the surface if I’m quick on my toes and when it does, it only lasts 3-4 days as opposed to the week or longer it would take to run a course on its own.	2	February 15, 2021	1
Abreva (Topical)		I use Abreva as soon as I think I am getting a cold sore but I also take Lysine tablets at that time. Do some research about Lysine before you take it, see if it works for you. If a cold sore actually still surfaces, (not too often), then I keep using the Abreva as a barrier to keep the cells from spreading. I keep the ointment on only the cold sore and never rub it in or smear it. That will only cause more cells to become more infected. Hope this helps someone.	6	February 5, 2021	1
Abreva (Topical)		Have tried Abreva a few times. Never works. This last time I applied it right away when I started to feel the itch and tingling. As others have said I got the biggest blister ever and it spread super fast. Took over a week to even get some relief. My sister  who also gets them has tried Abreva before and said the same thing. Doesn't help at all. Also way overpriced for no results.		January 13, 2021	2
Abreva (Topical)		Used Abreva for the first time at the first sign of a coldsore.  I ended up with the biggest ugliest coldsore I ever had.  Horrible!	1	January 2, 2021	3
Abreva (Topical)		The negative reviews are wild to me. I've been using this for 20 years. I don't get them often enough to use the same tube twice, but the moment I feel even the slightest tingle, I am at a pharmacy within 10 minutes buying this. It works if you use it RIGHT away. The giant blister clump won't form. That is exactly how it is advertised. If the blisters have already formed, it will be as effective as mayonnaise, just go ahead and cancel your plans, you're done for a couple of weeks.	10	December 27, 2020	6
Abreva (Topical)		I agree with the first few I've read.  Abreva does NOT work and its WAY overpriced.  Been to see the doctor who gave me valtrex for the cold sores and said to use Abreva topically also.  Guess what? Months later I still have them.  I've experimented and neither works, either together or on its own.  No matter what I do it never develops beyond a blister, just kind of ebbs and flows in severity. I'm so frustrated I could scream.  Been fighting the dang things for almost a year now.  Ridiculous that there isn't something out there that works.	1	October 5, 2020	6
Abreva (Topical)		Abreva either makes more sores appear, or gives me another outbreak right away. Bad stuff. And expensive!	1	September 28, 2020	7
Abreva (Topical)		"If you already have blisters or lesions, go to the doctor... do not buy Abreva. Just like you, I hoped it would fix the problem in 2 1/2 days as advertised and didn't really have time for a trip to the doctor's office. I wasted $30 and prolonged my face deformity by relying on Abreva. New blisters actually popped up after I started using it! Only after I got proper anti-virals did the blister (and its Abreva friends) begin to heal. The doctor actually told me, ""I've never had much luck with patients who use Abreva."" Get anti-virals if you need to show your face in public anytime soon."	1	August 31, 2020	8
Abreva (Topical)		This sucks. Don’t waste your money, it makes it worse. Every. Single. Time.	1	August 22, 2020	5
Abreva (Topical)		I had been getting terrible cold sores on the outside wrapping to the inside of my nostrils for the last 10 years. Every six months or whenever I would get a cold and wipe my nose excessively, I would get one. They were painful and embarrassing and just overall gross. I have had three doctors who have given me all types of meds for it. None worked. My cold sore would last 11 days no matter what. None of my doctors mentioned abreva. One day I had a break out and my husband (on a whim) grabbed me some abreva. I applied it right away and my cold sore only lasted four days instead of 11. I apply it every time I have an itching or burning sensation where I used to get cold sores and I HAVE NOT GOTTEN ONE SINCE. I highly recommend this product.	10	August 21, 2020	5
Abreva (Topical)		I’ve been getting fever blisters for years, usually 1-2x a year now and I’m fairly good at getting them to die down within 2-5 days. I see a lot of negative comments about Abreva, I decided to try it because I really need this blister gone QUICK this time. I started using it in the first stage of a little bump yesterday - along side lysine rich foods ONLY during my outbreaks, extra lysine supplements and my valacyclovir - with my whole regimen my blister has already began to shrink and crust over within 24 hours - making this the quickest time I’ve made it basically disappear and I think a huge part of that is the Abreva I added to the mix.   You cannot solely rely on medication to aid in your outbreak - you must also watch your diet, your stress levels and any triggers - such as heat, wind, sweating - anything that can irritate the virus infected cells must be avoided or the medications are just a weak band aid.	10	May 29, 2020	13
Abreva (Topical)		$25 for a minimal amount and it took just as long to heal as if I had not used anything. It would be nice if the price would reflect the usefulness of this product.      	1	May 7, 2020	8
Abreva (Topical)		I've gotten fever blisters all my life, and so around 3rd grade I started to use abreva and it honestly helps tremendously with the pain but not so much with actually getting rid of the cold sore. I've found that using hand sanitizer works great with taking it away tho. it dries it up in 2 days tops if you apply it often enough. obviously don’t cover your whole mouth with it tho cuz your lips will get crusty lol. but this combination really works for me so I thought I’d share.	4	March 13, 2020	3
Abreva (Topical)		Every few years I seem to forget why I quit buying abreva.   Normally my coldsores last 3-4days, don't get very big etc. . But EVERY SINGLE TIME I give abreva a try, 1 small bump turns into 5 or 6 huge blisters so bad I can barely talk .  Literally have only had that happen when using abreva.  I don't know why I keep going back to it. It's horrible.	1	March 10, 2020	18
Abreva (Topical)		I started using the very first day I felt that tingle and within 4 days I had another blister, and then just as the first one was starting to clear up, along came a third. It’s been 7 days since I started using this product and I now have 3 blisters that don’t look like they’re going anywhere soon. I’m so disappointed.	1	March 8, 2020	14
Abreva (Topical)		I get cold sores usually once or 2x a year and used abreva and it only made it worse, it would grow and just be embarrassing,  so I've stuck with ACV	6	February 24, 2020	7
Abreva (Topical)		Hi! French Horn player here, and also cold sore sufferer. For those who don't know, playing any brass instrument with a cold sore is the worst thing ever. It bursts open, and you cannot take 2 weeks off for a simple cold sore especially when preparing for performances. So, usually my cold sores last longer because they are not given a fair chance at healing. I started feeling the first signs and we have a big performance coming up, so I finally gave in and bought generic brand abreva. I can't recommend this enough. It's the weekend (so no playing) and it's been 2 days since its appearance, and the cold sore is already in the final stages (scabbing and healing) (side note: I have also been taking vitamin D and C because its prime flu season so maybe that is helping, unsure). Now, I will say that the blister forms much faster when you apply it right away, however the sore doesn't get as big, and within a couple days is healing. I have been applying 3-4 times a day. Seriously try it.	10	February 24, 2020	4
Abreva (Topical)		Does not stop the blister from growing (Use Valtrex for that) but, put it on at first sight of blister and put on 5 times a day for several days.  It definitely helps heal the blister faster!  I was amazed at how quickly my blister healed	9	February 5, 2020	2
Abreva (Topical)		58-yr-old male w/near 50 yrs experience w/cold sores! When I was young my mom insisted on kissing me; seeing that “thing” on her lip I resisted. Ever since? Cold sores. Who knew better in 1970?. Started w/my own home remedies (using softened underside of bar of soap to gather that 'cream'; worked somewhat.) Tried other concoctions.  Then in 2000, Abreva! Used properly, works like magic elixir. After showering, washing your face, need to re-apply. Being allergic? Can't predict that. Don't use it once you learn that.  Key: apply upon FIRST notice of tingling. Then, you NEVER GET THE COLD SORE!!! Be sure to apply every few hours, just a little, for a couple days, even a couple applications AFTER tingling stops. You'll end up using about 1/5 of tube; careful with the 1st 'squirts' – it'll come gushing out. Now, generics out there aplenty. Make sure they have 10% docosanol – the active ingredient that does the work. Go with whatever generic is cheapest. No more than $8/tube today.	9	January 29, 2020	6
Abreva (Topical)		This is my first outbreak. The pain is unbearable. Started using abreva and I feel like it just made my sores worse and it also caused them to get bigger. Now I have two huge scabs that look absolutely disgusting. I wonder if leaving it alone would've been a better option.	4	January 22, 2020	14
Abreva (Topical)		I swear I am experiencing the same thing with the Abreva pump! I’ve used the tube , no problem, so I  got a tingle, got the pump...& BOOM , the worst cold sore ever, it swelled , oozing & spread, also little hive like bumps on top lip as someone else stated. I went to the Dr. yesterday & was told I had an allergic reaction was given 2 shots one predinisone the other Benadryl....sent home with a script for both to take in pill form. The swelling went down some it’s been about 24 hrs but the blisters are weeping and so am I. I’m just going to finish my meds, scrap the Abreva & continue with tee tree oil, aloe & original Neosporin..... after ready these comments I’m glad I know I’m not crazy.	1	January 14, 2020	9
Abreva (Topical)		I used Abreva when I was younger and it really helped a lot. Now I recently saw a fever blister on the corner of my lip so I went and bought Abreva right away and applied it to both sides of the corners of my lip. The next morning both corners of my lip was super swollen and there were several blisters!!! I couldn’t even close my mouth without being in such pain.  Definitely won’t be ever using Abreva again. Very expensive and I can’t even go out in public like this!	1	January 11, 2020	11
Abreva (Topical)		Abreva really works for me.  I’ve tried every other suggestion out there for the past several decades, to little avail.  It must be used IMMEDIATELY upon the first tingle, HOWEVER, and several times per day, and more often if it gets washed off in the shower, or after eating.  Rarely now do my cold sores get out of control for weeks on end.  When I catch them early, and I happen to have Abreva at hand, I’m looking at 3 or 4 days max to keep it down or essentially invisible.  I find that I still have to treat new ones that may try to pop up in close proximity, but that holds true whether you use Abreva or not.  Keeping it down and treated also avoids serious scabbing, cracking, bleeding, which can all add days or weeks in additional healing time.  Don’t give up people, it’s probably the best thing out there if caught early.  Sure, some breakouts are worse than others, but Abreva is still my best buddy.  I keep it at hand always, at work, and bring it with me whenever I travel.	10	January 3, 2020	6
Abreva (Topical)		Abreva takes some of the pain away and helps in healing but then I notice that I will get another outbreak worse than the first one a few weeks later. This never happened until I started to use Abreva, It happens every time. No more Abreva for me!!!	4	December 31, 2019	5
Abreva (Topical)		Totally useless for me, does not shorten the time of the cold sore, just adds another conspicuous embarrassing white blob to your lip...great.	1	December 24, 2019	10
Abreva (Topical)		So i have suffered from cold sores for years. I finally decided to give abreva a try. So yesterday morning I woke up and could feel the tingling started, so when I left the house that morning I had a red spot starting to form, stopped and got abreva applied it right away. Rubbing it in, followed the directions ALL day (ended up applying 4 times) a small blister (rare normally a good size blister forms in a day or 2 for me) formed.  When i woke up next morning blister was already scabbed and was about 1/4-1/8 size of normal blister I get, only small amount of tingling remains, very happy and will TOTALLY use again and recommend....	10	December 21, 2019	1
Abreva (Topical)		Okay peeps here's the thing, cold sores don't always act the same way every time. It's possible that you are used to it looking a certain way every time it appears (like a small circle) but years later it can make you look like you got punched in the mouth and then go back to a small circle like you are used to. It's not the product that makes your cold sore worse unless you have an allergic reaction to the chemical make up of the product but that would result in hives. Abreva is a great topical option to use ALONG with other treatment. There are medications you can use to cut the cold sore short. Do a little research and talk to your doctor to see about getting a script.  In my opinion Abreva isn't strong enough to deal with the cold sore on its own; but it is definitely beneficial when you use it along with medication.	8	December 8, 2019	12
Abreva (Topical)		Started using abreva last year for cold sores and it works, it is the closest thing to a cure I've come across. I can completely bypass a cold sore if used at first sign. Is also instrumental to the way I treat a cold sore	10	December 1, 2019	4
Abreva (Topical)		Abreva has worked for me every time.   If you use it at first sign, and rub it in until the product disappears every time you use it, it will stop the virus from growing and spreading.  My outbreaks are gone in 3 to 4 days.   If you dab it on and don’t rub it in, it won’t work.  If you use it after the blister has begun to form, it won’t work.   Also, even if you use it at first sign, the blister will form, but it won’t be as big.	9	November 17, 2019	12
Abreva (Topical)		Abreva was used at the very beginning before I even felt a tingle. I used it and it spread the cold sore terribly. Now I have two outbreak spots which is very rare for how I get them. Never buying this again. Con product that doesn’t do anything but make it way worse.	1	November 17, 2019	12
Abreva (Topical)		So unfortunately I have had cold sore outbreaks for years. I hate the stigma attached to them. But I've always used Abreva. From the pump or the tube. Both worked great... However.....this time I'm currently laid up in bed unable to speak because my cold sore has literally multiplied into several little bumps it's incredibly painful to do anything and my lip look so swollen I feel like I was punched in the lip. I don't know what happen to Abreva but it use to be good. This time has almost got me wanting to go to the hospital 	5	November 16, 2019	18
Abreva (Topical)		Best product ever for a cold sore.  This product has always reduced the size of and time of any cold sore I've had!	10	November 16, 2019	2
Abreva (Topical)		Wow...I have had just the opposite of some of the other comments.  I have had terrible cold sores all my life....and  Abreva is the best I have found to lessen the pain and start the healing, and keep the cold sore from growing to a big mess.  It has also shortened considerably the painful week or two of a cold sore.  It doesn't work overnight, but being consistent over a couple of days works wonders!  I will definitely use it every time!	8	November 6, 2019	6
Abreva (Topical)		Vitamin C. Make it your best friend. It binds to the water in your body not your blood so you have to take it consistently. They call them “cold sores “ because your immune system is compromised while you have a cold so it gives the virus a chance to break out. It sucks. I get mine on my nose and hurts terribly.	1	November 5, 2019	7
Abreva (Topical)		I take Abreva to shorten the duration of cold sore symptoms. I haven't found anything that works better. I will still get the cold sore, but if I treat at first sign, it's much less of a big deal than years gone by.  It also seems to work better if you take care of sleep, nutrition and stress as best you can. The virus is after all, opportunistic.	8	November 4, 2019	3
Abreva (Topical)		Ok... Guys... This cream may work only at the very beginning of this awful sickness hahaha... Was reading the reviews... Found this salt water recipe which works.  Seriously it burns your lips but it is good. You see I applied this cream many times but it only worsen my condition. My blister was getting bigger. Till I made a very strong salt water mix and washed my mouth with it couple times. My blister skin peeled off.  Ou yea. You betcha. It works. Couple more times and I'm all good... Try it!		October 31, 2019	12
Abreva (Topical)		I had a tingle on my lower lip and felt a bump forming. I decided to get Abreva because I’ve used it years before and it worked for cold sores. I always use Q-tips to apply and made sure no double dipping. BUT this time it made it 100x worse. Blister Bumps formed all over my bottom lip and spread to my upper lip and to the nose. I had to go to the doctor to get oral medication. Don’t ever use this product !!!!	1	October 27, 2019	11
Abreva (Topical)		I thought I had a cold sore but I think it was actually just a crack at the corner of my mouth from dry skin. I started applying Abreva and began to get little red bumps around my mouth, mostly where I was applying the Abreva. The rash spread and now I have blistery red bumps all around my mouth, and a split lip. I will never buy this stuff again.	1	October 24, 2019	11
Abreva (Topical)		I had 2 little bumps near the bottom of my lip.. I put abreva on it soon as I felt the tingling and saw the bumps starting. I went to bed and woke up the next morning. It now looks like I got punched in the mouth and I have about 7 bumps on my lip. This is the worst product I have ever used. Its 5 to 6 times the size it was before I went to bed.	1	October 23, 2019	10
Abreva (Topical)		Used Abreva once prior (from the tube). Had some swelling but within three days everything seemed to be healed and back to normal. Used the new pump this time and, MY GOD, things have taken a turn for the worse. Sometimes, after being in the sun for hours and from not getting enough rest, I’ll develop super tiny blisters on the inside of my upper lip. I put Abreva (from the pump) on this time and used it as I did with the Abreva from the tube. NEVER AGAIN. My entire lip is swollen 10x it’s normal size. It now looks like I have a million tiny little bubbles in my lip that I am PRAYING do not surface. The original three little blisters are now 7-8 and are oozing. It hasn’t spread to my face or upper lip but seems to have spread across my entire bottom lip. I don’t know if it’s an allergic reaction or if the condition has worsened. Either way, I will not use this product again. I stopped using it completely for the past 24 hours thinking the symptoms would subside. I was wrong.	1	October 20, 2019	6
Abreva (Topical)		Got a cold sore for the first time and decided to buy Abreva since they seemed like the best to heal fast. Worst decision ever! I used the cream for 10 days and my cold sore never got away, it actually got worst. Now it’s been 3 weeks and my lips are still a bit swollen and I have to go see my doctor since the cold sore keeps coming back. Don’t buy!	1	October 16, 2019	3
Abreva (Topical)		Felt a slight tingle on my upper lip with no visible bump/blister.  Tingle went away within a few minutes. Just to be on the safe side, I applied Abreva. Immediately started itching and a bump appeared within 10 minutes. Another bump surfaced within an hour. Applied another dose and low and behold, I had a 3rd cluster of bumps forming within 6 hours. 20 of my smackeroos spent on something resembling a botched lip job. I know better. Every time I use this stuff- regardless of what stage my cold sore is in- it makes it worse. Every single time. But I want to believe in it. Not anymore. Today, I am over the false hope of Abreva and accepting of the fact that this OTC is wasted money and a detriment to the herpes healing process. Just threw it in the trash because it is garbage!!!	1	October 13, 2019	5
Abreva (Topical)		Put it on immediately in the morning when I felt the tingles and by the end of the day it got bigger and spread and looks terrible, I will never buy abreva agian	1	October 12, 2019	3
Abreva (Topical)		I’ve used this product during 3 out breaks on my lip. I’ve applied it as instructed and it hasn’t work at all. Literally made no difference. On the 5th day which was today, I actually developed a smaller eruption just below the original one. This being even as I was using the medication the whole time.	1	October 11, 2019	1
Abreva (Topical)		This medication is horrible. I used it for a week with no results. I agree with others. I think it makes it worse.	1	October 11, 2019	2
Abreva (Topical)		I usually get one cold sore a year and I tried Abreva for the first time earlier this year and it worked, but I got another cold sore on Sunday which never happens that I get twice in a year and this time it’s HUGE it was bad and I never had a coldsore like this until after I used Abreva so I’m pretty sad because I still used it again and it’s making it scab over quicker but still like I feel like it’s going to make my next outbreak worst. 		October 9, 2019	2
Abreva (Topical)		This is my 2nd time using abreva the first time was not good but I thought it was due to not catching the first sign of my cold sore. So now I had the first sign of a cold sore and decided to really see if this product works. I used abreva and the next day my lip had more bumps and was more swollen. Just awful experience.	1	October 7, 2019	3
Abreva (Topical)		1/3 cup of warm water and a full spoon of salt. Mix well. Swish around your mouth for about 30 sec. it will burn... a lot. Do this 3-4 times a day and I kid you not it’ll go away within 3 days. Painful but worth it	1	October 5, 2019	9
Abreva (Topical)		Whenever I use the abreva my cold sore gets a lot worst... I don't know why. I always wash my hands before applying the product. Also, I don't like the new pump version. It pumps out a lot of product that ends up going to waste. Find another alternative!	2	October 1, 2019	4
Abreva (Topical)		I had an outbreak for the first time. It started off inside my mouth & when those burst it appeared on the outer corners. I couldn’t get a prescription, so I got Abreva.   I used alcohol pads first to disinfect the area. Then I applied Abreva with a q-tip, only dabbing (not spreading). I used a new swab every time I went to a different area on my face. I followed with a mild lotion (q-tips again) & coconut oil.   I repeated this morning, night, & after every meal for four days. I got small bumps on my lips that lasted a day or so. I didn’t use chapstick & only applied anything with clean swabs. The corners of my mouth flared up after meals but calmed after the regiment. The blisters were so tiny that only I saw them.  Abreva worked for me but my lips feel stiff and puffy where I applied it. The blisters never popped, & I never got scarring or huge breakout. I believe the other experiences on the site, next time I’ll use something else and not push my luck with this product.	9	September 24, 2019	5
Abreva (Topical)		"The product works. The packaging (pump bottle) doesn't work well at all. It""s difficult to get out the right amount. And the pump quits working, leaving product in the bottle."	9	September 20, 2019	5
Abreva (Topical)		Just awful; I cried. I used Abreva at first signs of a cold sore, and within hours, my upper lip erupted into massive painful blisters that resembled a marble. I thought it was a fluke, so I gave it another shot next time. Same reaction; I'll never use Abreva gain.	1	September 17, 2019	9
Abreva (Topical)		I got my first cold sore in May. Saw my doctor and he told me to keep using  Abreva  until it went away. Well, naive me used the Abreva for 3 weeks. I didn’t know exactly how the outbreaks usually went so when they spread across both my upper and lower lip, I didn’t realize it was the Abreva causing the mess; until they swelled up like balloons over night and my face became bumpy and itchy. I got a prescription for Valtrex and stopped Abreva immediately after that. However, my lips STILL are not 100% back to normal (4 months later). It’s like it mostly goes away for no more than 1-2 weeks before it comes back. The Valtrex helps, but there’s something else going on here. I’d like to know if anyone else has issues like me.	1	September 15, 2019	6
Abreva (Topical)		I’m amazed at how many people have had the same experience with Abreva recently. I am convinced that the formula has changed. I get cold sores very infrequently but I have always had success with applying it at the first tingle or itch.  I have had two this year and applied immediately but ended up with full blown blisters and a puffy lip which has never happened to me before. Good to know it’s not just me...I was thinking my body had become immune.  I think I will need to look into other options at this point.	2	September 10, 2019	11
Abreva (Topical)		I've used Abreva in the past it worked amazing. Normally I apply as soon as I feel the tingle but this time oh my goodness my face is so swollen. They must have changed the formula this stuff used to be amazing now it is garbage.	4	September 8, 2019	7
Abreva (Topical)		I got my first cold sore in high school and my lip swelled up so big that I couldn’t talk. Well I’m out of college now and have tried to continue on using abreva and I’m not kidding when I say it makes my cold sore even worse if that’s possible! My lip will swell up so big that it splits and I break out into more sores if I use abreva. It will also take 2 weeks for the scabs to come off. My lip is so damaged and scarred now. I switched to a prescription topical and a oral cold sore medication. I also take Lysine every day and use Lysine ointment as lip balm as well. I use to only get them once a year and now I get them every 3-4 months. My advice is steer clear from abreva!	1	September 8, 2019	3
Abreva (Topical)		I have had outbreaks since I was 7 years old. We all know that sinking feeling that comes with that lip tingle, or from waking up to a new sore. I've spent hours trying to find home remedies and determining triggers. Eventually, I started to rely on Abreva to help keep the lifecycle of an outbreak short. Fast forward 15+ years of Abreva use to today. I've had two outbreaks in the past year. Both times I reached for the Abreva, both times it got worse. Lots worse. Time to speak to my doctor about daily antivirals.	2	September 5, 2019	6
Abreva (Topical)		Seems like this is purely psychological placebo.  I’ve had far more negative experiences (where I go to put abreva on early for a small bump and wake up with 5 full blown sores) than positive.  Looking at these reviews I can see I’m not alone.	1	September 4, 2019	4
Abreva (Topical)		The worst product ever . I put it on my cold sore the day I saw it pop up it was tiny and now my symptoms just worsened and my blisters are HUGE not to mention every time I’d apply it it would burn and tingle like crazy. I WOULD NOT recommend	1	September 2, 2019	2
Abreva (Topical)		Tried it three separate times. Same thing happened. Produced a larger outbreak than leaving it alone. This product should be relabeled at Herpes fertilizer.	1	August 29, 2019	12
Abreva (Topical)		Abreva does work when used correctly. Also, Valtrex plus Abreva can prevent any further outbreaks. As soon as I feel my lip tingle I take a Valtrex and that usually gets it. Sometimes it doesn't and I have to use Abreva. I had an outbreak at work this morning. I panicked, but I took my Valtrex and didn't touch it until I used my abreva. What started out as bubbly bumps are now smoothed out and I'm just on 1 day application of it.	8	August 28, 2019	4
Abreva (Topical)		I usually use an orajel product and it seems to work. So a they didn't have it in stock. I seen abreva and had only heard great things. I had a tiny little bump I put on the abreva and went to bed now wake up with over a half dozen and it is awful. Thank you abreva	1	August 25, 2019	2
Abreva (Topical)		Don’t waste your money!!! I applied the product Abreva correctly only for it to make more cold sores appear.	1	August 24, 2019	1
Abreva (Topical)		I've been using this product on and off for about a year. Anytime I feel a flare up I'll pop a little bit of Abreva onto my lips underneath my lip balm and it INSTANTLY (or at least overnight) takes care of the issue!   My last flare up yesterday had resulted in a blister forming. I panicked as I thought it might be too late for the medication to work its magic most effectively but I applied anyway and within one day the blister popped and revealed nice soft lips underneath! Best of all, no further tingles or irritation.	10	August 22, 2019	3
Abreva (Topical)		I got abreva because the commercials say it can heal a cold sore and as little as two and a half days I have been using it for a week my cold sore hasn't gone away		August 17, 2019	2
Abreva (Topical)		I usually use abreva and it usually works for me but this time I used it at the first sign of my cold sore (as usual) and FIVE MORE CAME UP! So now it’s like I have 5 cold sores built up in one area on my face! Thank you abreva!	2	August 15, 2019	1
Abreva (Topical)		I haven’t had this bad of a breakout since I first got cold sores and didn’t know what to do. Oh, and I also was taking antibiotics for it but I thought the abreva would help prevent scaring...OMG was I wrong! It’s SO SO much worse and I’m so miserable!!	1	August 11, 2019	0
Abreva (Topical)		Same as everyone else. I used to use this product with great results but the last two times I've used it, my face blew up and got swollen, and the medication actually worsened the blister 10x what it normally is.   Worst medication ever. Do not use.	1	August 10, 2019	1
Abreva (Topical)		I usually use tea tree oil and ice, but this time I asked my wife if I could use her Abreva.  This was on day two when I had either won the race with the oil and ice or lost. I thought I had lost. But, the oil and Abreva shrank the blister over night and after two days it is nearly gone.  I will use Abreva from now on.	10	August 9, 2019	2
Abreva (Topical)		Similar to everyone else. In the past I've used Abreva and 3-4 days later the sore is well on its way to being healed. Now? My sore is massive. Biggest I've had in a decade. Absolutely not worth the 21 bucks. I'll go back to Herpacin and ride it out.	1	August 7, 2019	2
Abreva (Topical)		Abreva worked before great in the past.  This time made it worse.  They must if changed the formula.	3	August 5, 2019	0
Abreva (Topical)		I used abreva at the first signs of cold sore which I get infrequently. 2 days later the site was clearing up and I thought I was good, until several more fluid filled blisters erupted! That never happens to me. I usually use tea tree oil and coconut oil but thought maybe abreva would clear it up faster, I’ll be going back to my usual routine! Very disappointed!	1	August 2, 2019	3
Abreva (Topical)		I put Abreva on as soon as I noticed the cold sore coming on and it got worse. I thought maybe I just didn't put it on soon enough, so I continued to use it. Now, three days later and it's huge, five blisters (which some are bleeding), and just horrific looking. They changed and now their product is awful. Don't waste your money.	1	August 2, 2019	0
Abreva (Topical)		Doesn’t work at all. I applied it at the first sign and woke up with very a swollen lip and a cluster of super sore blisters.	1	July 31, 2019	3
Abreva (Topical)		Since I discovered Abreva, I have only had an outbreak once in the last 16 years and that was my fault for not applying it soon enough. It works great but you have to always be on alert for a tingle or red warm spot. It will never materialize if so. I even put it on as a precaution when I know I will be in long meetings or outdoors for a long period of time time. It really won't work once a breakout begins. I always carry a tube in my wallet. It gets expensive but worth every penny to avoid a week of those hideous nightmares.	10	July 27, 2019	1
Abreva (Topical)		I don't know what's wrong with all the other users rating this product poorly. Abreva ALWAYS heals my cold sores super fast. I suspect they are not applying it correctly? You have to use it several times a day. Basically, keep Abreva on your sore until it heals. If you only apply it once it's not going to work. My sores always heal within 3-4 days. I apply it as soon as I feel that tingle on my lip and it never erupts. It stays just a barely noticeable little bump.	9	July 26, 2019	6
Abreva (Topical)		Much like others on this list, I applied Abreva at the first sign of a cold sore this morning. And what was 1 tiny spot on my upper lip has ballooned into a cluster of puffiness. I wish I had seen the other reviews before I applied it. I do not recommend this product.	1	July 24, 2019	1
Abreva (Topical)		Wow! Crazy reading through all of these comments! I count myself lucky, I usually only get one blister a year in the spring as the weather heats up. This year I've been traveling a lot more for work to some warm dry climates. I've had to deal with them more than usual. I typically rely on valtrex however being on the road and running out of my prescription has caused me to turn to other methods. Fortunately abreva didn't make it worse but it certainly didn't help either. I heard great things about it in the past it's a shame that it no longer holds any value. Curious to learn how others deal with the annoying little blisters when in a pinch if valtrex isn't available or an option? Anyone have any recommendations?	1	July 18, 2019	2
Abreva (Topical)		I just had an outbreak this morning and only got to the pharmacy this afternoon to buy the abreva which surprisingly was on special for $15.99 instead of $20.99. I put it on and within hours, and in comparison to earlier in the day the 3 little blisters were noticeably more swollen and bubbly. It's my first time using this product and I am truly disappointed given the rap sheet it had before. I'm looking for alternatives now.	3	July 18, 2019	3
Abreva (Topical)		Ive been getting cold sores for 10 years now. I bought Abreva to help speed along the healing process. Its embarassing  having cold sores at work. Big mistake. I still have the cold sore and its even bigger and grosser. Without Abreva they're usually gone within a couple days. Throw it away... Do not buy this product. I quit my job because I was being treated poorly by my coworkers. Do not buy. Does not help cold sores at all.	1	July 15, 2019	1
Abreva (Topical)		For the last three years I’ve gotten a cold sore in the summer time. Usually induced by stress and hormones and sunshine. This past week I felt the tingle on my lip and went to Walgreens immediately to get Abreva. It has worked in the past- drying up the sore and allowing me to move on with life. However, this time it made my cold sore way worse. It spread onto my cheek and to the other side of my lip. The product is so runny that it naturally spreads throughout your face when you go to rub it in. My face has been burning for two days now. I’ve been applying ice and warm towels to my face. I even took out my 800 my ibuprofen I was given 6 months ago for postpartum recovery because the pain was that bad. I spent a whole day with a headache and feeling all around ill. Needless to say, this product is a scam and needs to be removed from the market. Thank you to those who shared alternative ways for relief.	1	July 15, 2019	0
Abreva (Topical)		Completely escalated my symptoms. I cannot believe this is happening! Stay away from this product!	1	July 14, 2019	2
Abreva (Topical)		Abreva doesn't work! I'm not sure what's changed (their formula?) But I used to use it and be fine. Cold sore would heal and go away quickly. But now, it doesn't! It makes it 10xs worse!! I go from one tiny bump, put it on, and within 2 hours have tons going down from my lip. Now I have 8 little bumps. Ridiculous!!!	1	July 13, 2019	2
Abreva (Topical)		I have used Abreva for many years with the tingling beginning of a blister on my lips. It has always worked exceptionally well. Recently I got a blister on my chin, while nothing on my lips. I put abreva on it and it did not respond at all like it had before. This time more popped up and it seemed abreva did nothing. My coworker had shingles at the same time and I am wondering if the blisters on my chin were slightly different than what I had had on my lips before?	9	July 6, 2019	0
Abreva (Topical)		I've been using Abreva for about a year, they definitely changed the formula this time around. I put it on once, where in the past when I used it , it would just scab up, now it turns into about 12 sores, all down my lip, under my lip towards my chin, caused a burn on my actual skin, its tearing me up!  $18 a tube and its just adding to my sores and pain! These things are already embarrassing because people want to act like they're not common or whatever but they are common and I've seen children with them. This was the only stuff that worked for me and now here we go. Thanks a lot Abreva	2	July 5, 2019	2
Abreva (Topical)		When I got my cold sore it was small I used this soon I got it. Later that damn day it was huge I had to go to the doctor to get cream.	1	July 4, 2019	1
Abreva (Topical)		I've gotten cold sores since I was younger and they're always about the same until I bought Abreva last night, HUGE MISTAKE! It got so much bigger and extra blisters spreading onto my face under my lip.  Went to doctors today and she said that my cold sore had gotten severely infected.  She prescribed me valacyclovir 1G to be taken 3x daily for 7 days! DON'T EVER USE ABREVA!!!!!!!!	1	June 21, 2019	4
Abreva (Topical)		I just joined the pool of unfortunate souls who fell victim to this harmful product. It's overpriced, the applicator isn't user friendly, and yes, it made the cold sore way worse than it's ever been before. I usually get these sores right after having the flu. Sometimes, they're barely visible. This time, I had one tiny little spot in the center of my lip. I applied the product generously to the entire area. The entire bottom lip blew up within a few hours. There needs to be class action lawsuit and a recall of this horrible product.	1	June 21, 2019	10
Abreva (Topical)		ABREVA DOES NOT WORK!!! FDA needs to ban it from the market! If I could post a picture, I would! I agree with everyone else’s statements! Use Valtrex if you’re not allergic to it!  Attack unsightly cold sore blisters as soon as they appear with  Campho-Phenique Max strength! Throw away the Abreva in your drawer right now! Do it now! It does not work! I used it at the first sign of the tingle! 3 hours later, my entire left side of my lip was swollen and a large cluster of blisters were visible! Talk about embarrassing! We need to start a petition to get Abreva off the market! It is a scam!!!! Used a q-tip to apply it! Ha! The end result- a swollen upper lip that’s semi hardened on that side with multiple blisters! I have used in the past. I will say within the last 8-10 years, I believe they have secretly changed the formulation especially if you’re applying it at the first indication of a cold sore/ fever blister!		June 19, 2019	5
Abreva (Topical)		I agree with everyone here that says it made their cold sore 10x worse. I get cold sores like once a twice a year and the last time I started to get one, I immediately applied abreva and the next day my lip was enormously swollen and spread to my bottom lip..I personally feel the best thing for cold sores Is to apply orajel for cold sores to it, ibuprofen for pain, benadryl for the itching and to use peroxide to clean it with cotton balls or just pouring it over affected area. Abreva is awful and not to mention ridiculously expensive!!	1	June 14, 2019	4
Abreva (Topical)		They must have changed the formula?!?! I'm having the same awful experience most of you are. Felt the tingle  Ran to the pharmacy as fast as I could(drove) When I got there in the morning there was only the $40 2 pack and nothing else on the shelf?!  I didn't have a choice. Got it and it's the most massacistic way I've ever spent money. Put it on. Took a nap (keeping my face positioned up,) and woke up two hrs later to my lip swollen 4x the normal size. Three massive blisters spanned my lip after using this product. It used to help me in the past and now my worst nightmare has happened. I'm too embarrassed to go to work like this and can't concentrate on anything but the throbbing pain that feels like my lip will actually burst.	1	June 13, 2019	5
Abreva (Topical)		I have used abreva multiple times and don’t feel that it’s helpful. It does make it more swollen but allows it the crust faster but drying it out.   I don’t use it anymore but strongly encourage people to ask their docs for valtrex. It’s a pill mediation specifically for herpes 1 or 2 - the virus that causes the blisters.   Works super well!!! I’ll have a tiny bump and take one pill and it’ll be gone the next day. It never gets bigger as long as I take it right away. The process is much more manageable and less embarrassing since it rarely ever gets to the scabbing stage.	2	June 9, 2019	4
Abreva (Topical)		I get cold sores maybe once a year and usually just wait for them to go away on their own. Decided to try Abreva this time around. Worst mistake of my life. Within a few days of using the cream it had spread to a painful quarter-sized patch of fluid-filled blisters all over my upper lip and the skin below my nose. I've NEVER seen anything like it; it was so hideous that people would flinch when they looked at me (as I still had to go to work and have a life while this was going on). Took almost three months to heal, and I still have a scar from it. I don't know what they put in Abreva but stay away.	1	June 6, 2019	2
Abreva (Topical)		Used abreva in the past and had no issues. This week I started feeling tingling on my face and went and bought a tube it’s been 3 days and my lip is now swollen and spreading. I’m happy to see I’m not the only one this happened to.  Definitely will never buy again and hope some of the suggestions on here will work for me and I can get rid of this embarrassing bubble on my face.	1	June 6, 2019	2
Abreva (Topical)		After using Abreva during the tingling stage, my sore spread to other parts of my upper lip which has never happened before.  It's almost as if the drug is bottling up the virus and the virus explodes cause it has no where to go.  Whatever the reason, this is the worst outbreak I've ever had. Will try a different product next go around.	1	June 5, 2019	5
Abreva (Topical)		Have had cold sores since the 60's. When Abreva first came out I bought some and it worked wonderfully. Not anymore and not at all. This is reflected in the reviews. Older ones are almost all positive and newer ones almost all negative. I believe the reason people are having sores explode, becoming the worst they have ever had is that it no longer has ANY of the active ingredient in the cream and when its applied it spreads the virus around without blocking it from entering healthy cells. I plan to call company and complain loudly and maybe the FDA as well.	1	June 4, 2019	8
Abreva (Topical)		I wish I'd read these reviews before sending my husband to the pharmacy yesterday to buy me some Abreva. I get cold sores from time to time, and this time I decided to actually buy something to speed along the healing process. BAD IDEA. I applied abreva to my very small, barely noticeable cold sore yesterday afternoon. By bedtime, literally 4 hours after the first application, my lip was swollen to twice it's normal size and what started as a tiny spot is now dime sized. It literally looks like someone punched me in the face. Anywhere I applied the abreva broke out into a huge cold sore. My lip looks terrible and it hurts and itches like crazy. I am so upset!  What was supposed to help made everything significantly worse!! I should have just left it alone! I called the doctor and they are calling me in a prescription for Valtrex so that maybe this monstrosity will go away! I have never been so embarrassed. Seriously... This is the worst cold sore I've ever had in my life!	1	June 4, 2019	3
Abreva (Topical)		I took Abreva and it made my cold sore worse !! It started with a small cold sore and I just wanted it to go away as I had an important event coming up so I rushed to go buy it. Instead it made my cold sore bigger and my lip is sooooo swollen. I try to do cold compress every couple hours but the swelling won’t go down. I watched some videos and they recommended apple cider vinegar . My cold sore is not in the drying up/ crusting stage bit my like is so swollen which makes it completely worse. I bought this item so it could help me not make everything worse. I definitely  deserve a refund !!!	1	June 2, 2019	3
Abreva (Topical)		Used this once and I ended up with the worst cold sore I ever had.  DO NOT USE	1	May 29, 2019	5
Abreva (Topical)		Abreva has not worked for me. I strongly recommend lemon balm. It’s cheaper than abreva and actually works. I put a few drops on a qtip and apply it for 10 minutes. I do this a few times a day and the cold sore is gone the next day. My cold sore last a day or two, rather than a week or more like it did before I used lemon balm.	1	May 20, 2019	5
Abreva (Topical)		I had a tiny little sore on my lip yesterday and I used abreva and today it’s the size of a quarter reaching to my chin. I will not be using this again. Abreva made my cold sore worse!!!	1	May 17, 2019	4
Abreva (Topical)		Ive tried Abreva, the CVS brand, and the RightAid brand  over the last 4 years. I've also put nothing on the cold sore.  My conclusion, is none of these over the counter medicines do anything to make the cold sore go away quicker.   At this point I've tried everything.  What has helped is the following;  as soon as you feel that first tingle in the lip, you have to immediately take Lysine pill and immediately put ice on it as often as you can.  This worked for me, and a couple times it completely stopped the sore from developing in the first place.  This last time I was lazy and waited over night to get ice and take the Lysine and it was too late.  It still will shorten the life of the cold sore but still will be around for about a week if you wait until the sore is present. Also Rubbing alcohol 6 times a day will dry out the sore quicker. it worked for me	1	April 28, 2019	0
Abreva (Topical)		I have been getting severe cold sores since I was 6 years old. I was so excited the first time I bought this product when my lips were tingling and I knew they were developing even thought it was 5 times as expensive as blistex and Carmex. I used it faithfully.  By the next morning my lip was extremely swollen, 3 sores formed and I continued to use it 5-10 times per day.  No luck, they lasted 10 days with the same severity.  I have now used this product for two years hoping it will be different the next time.  It never is.  Unfortunately,  I am not sure what tests were performed to allow the FDA approval and claim that it heals faster.  I will go back to just using  Carmex and planning for 10 days of pain and embarrassment:(	1	April 19, 2019	4
Abreva (Topical)		Exactly as others have said- I put it on at the first tingle. Used it religiously ALL day. This morning I woke up with TWO huge blisters, my entire lip swollen, and pain radiating down my jaw. I am 31 and have had cold sores since before I started kindergarten. Never in my life has a product caused them to WORSEN. Biggest mistake, and waste of money. I don't know what to use now.	1	April 17, 2019	4
Abreva (Topical)		Abreva does NOT work. I've tried it numerous times and it's always the same result- nothing. I've had cold sores my entire life and the only thing that has ever worked was prescription valacyclovir (Valtrex). Don't waste your money or get your hopes up with Abreva.	1	April 12, 2019	1
Abreva (Topical)		Never in my life experienced the WORST product ever. As soon as I started using the product next day it got worst, I have my lip super swollen and it actually spread all over the lip.  DON'T BUY IT!	1	April 8, 2019	1
Abreva (Topical)		I’ve been getting cold sores for years, I was so excited I caught the cold sore this time when it was a tingle. I ran to the store, actually 3 because the first two were sold out of it, and bought some. I was recommended it by 3 friends. This is probably the second worst break out I’ve had in my life. I’m so sad. I’m two days in  working with the police academy, I’m a college student and it’s embarrassing. I had high hopes for Abreva. Maybe it works for some people but not for me. It actually spread off my lip onto my face and it has never ever done that before.	1	April 5, 2019	2
Abreva (Topical)		Abreva works for me. Me being a minimal wage worker,  and break out every month.I CANNOT afford the twenty bucks every cold sore. This last pump I bought was all liquid and it ran out in a day!!! I cut it open and it wasn't near as big as the tube. I believe they are ripping people off.	1	March 29, 2019	4
Abreva (Topical)		I get cold sores less than once a year which gives me time to forget how useless a treatment Abreva is for me - so I buy another expensive tube every time. I hope I remember to try something different next time instead of wasting my money.	1	March 26, 2019	3
Abreva (Topical)		I came here to read other reviews after buying my first tube of Abreva. Should have read the reviews first. Within hours of feeling the first symptom of a blister coming on I bought Abreva on my way home after work. Biggest mistake of my life. I usually use Camphonique. Or something along the lines. Might have spelled it wrong but nope.  Decided to try the big name brand and waste twenty dollars thinking this has got to work and I caught it so early on all proud and what not. My damn lip is so swollen. And I thought maybe this is a normal reaction and the swelling will go down. After 2 whole days I've had enough. Went back to my camphor and the swelling went down within the hour. So mad at myself for not reading reviews before hand.	1	March 25, 2019	6
Abreva (Topical)		Don’t use Abreva! Used Abreva for one week and my blister got worse!	1	March 20, 2019	3
Abreva (Topical)		I have had a few cold sores in my life and after using Abreva I can safely say it made the cold sore the worst I’ve ever had! It is literally half the size of my lip this time around. I noticed after applying the cream it would spread to wherever the cream touched. I believe this was intentional for you to buy more cream. All of my previous cold sores were 1/8th the size of this monster. I stopped applying Abreva and it stopped spreading immediately.	1	March 16, 2019	5
Abreva (Topical)		Felt a cold sore coming on, so went to get something for it. I was a bit put off by the price of Abreva, but I was helping teach a course in a few days and really wanted to get it under control. Not only did abreva not work, but I got a second blister in another spot! By far, the worst cold sore(s) of my life!! A wasted $20 for sure!	1	March 15, 2019	6
Abreva (Topical)		I have been using abreva for some years now and when it was in the tube, it worked  great.  The new pump version is runny and has been virtually ineffective.  It has  changed and NOT IN A GOOD WAY!!!	2	March 10, 2019	1
Abreva (Topical)		This product DOES NOT WORK! I’ve gotten cold sores for years, I would say maybe about 3 a year. While using abreva my cold sore spread and became more swollen. And while using abreva they can last up to two weeks. Go to a doctor and get a prescription for acyclovir or something similar. If I start taking this prescription right when I feel the cold sore, sometimes it doesn’t even develop or lasts about 1-2 days. For me, abreva just spread the cold sores and they last forever while using the cream!!!! I would just get a prescription for acyclovir and not even touch the cold sore at all.	1	March 6, 2019	0
Abreva (Topical)		I have used Abreva for many years with lots of luck. Since I ran out I bought there newest container. Its slightly larger than it used to be and being kind of pricy that made me happy. What didn't make me happy and it doesn't work anymore. In fact it has made it worse. I had two back to back cold sores I applied multiple times per day and they are the biggest they have ever been. I'm convinced with the bigger tube they thinned out the product so much it doesn't work anymore. I even purchased a second bottle in the pump form to see if I had bought a bad batch and still nothing.	1	February 7, 2019	2
Abreva (Topical)		Love this product.... I use it when I feel I am getting a cold sore and it helps to get rid of it before it starts..... love this product	10	February 6, 2019	2
Abreva (Topical)		I typically get a cold sore once a year well I felt one starting to form and I had tried abreva before but it was already after the blister had popped so it didn't really do much. Well this time I wanted to try since I felt it so early on and the next day the cold sore was bigger and worse than I  have ever had before on my life so I continued to use it not thinking maybe it was the abreva having negative effects well now I have another cold sore forming at the corner of my mouth I have never in my life had 2 at once I will not be using it anymore hopefully they will cure up on their own. Not a good experience I see a lot of people everyday and this is embarrassing	2	January 31, 2019	4
Abreva (Topical)		I never used abreva before, so I decided to try it. I applied it as soon as a felt the outbreak. This made it the WORST breakout I ever had. I highly recommend the Orajel vials, after 2 days of using them my cold sore went down significantly.	1	January 31, 2019	2
Absorica		Female, struggled with cystic hormonal acne on chest, back, neck, jawline and face for 9 years. Side Effects on Accutane;  Dry lips & small blisters on lips (occasional) Extremely dry red eyes (No contacts after 1st month) Abnormal hot flashes Face flushing Night vision decreased Nose bleeds Occasional blurred vision Fatigue Joint aches Headaches Fragile dry skin Dry hair Dry nose&throat Stomach pain and cramping (month 6) Hemmoriods Itchy skin & skin rash on hands  Side Effects I have now are; Dry eyes (I can wear contacts now but took 2 months after stopping meds and my eyes are still much drier than before. I have to use eye drops at night and in the morning) Dry lips (not bad) Occasional joint pain in hands  Hair loss/rapid hair shedding Itchy skin  All other side effects went away after ending meds. Worth it! 4 months after Accutane and I have no acne! Not a single cyst! I have normal skin and occasional tiny zits here and there only.	9	July 13, 2018	2
Absorica		My son was on this drug for about 4 months and the worst things happened.  He went from mild acne to the worst acne one can imagine.  It was horrible huge cystic acne.  We went to the doctor month after months with disgust in how bad his face got.  Eventually I pulled the plug and brought him to another doctor who agreed after showing him pictures that this drug was detrimentally ruining his skin.  He switched him to clarvis and within a couple of weeks it was clearing up.  My son's self esteem was detrimentally affected along with his skin. He will now need to have some type of resurfacing done to get his skin back.  We have pictures to prove what this did to his skin!!	1	February 23, 2017	8
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I have taken Adderall XR and short acting for 25 years and I got this new XR 30MG the other day Lannett and it made me tired, heart racing, BP accelerated and did NOTHING to help me focus. I contacted the pharmacy and my Dr and he's trying to switch me to another brand because this is a joke. awful..	1	April 26, 2021	3
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Just started taking adderall XR 10mg after learning I had been mis-diagnosed for 15+ years as either bi-polar, major depressive disorder and social anxiety. I finally found a psychiatrist that really dug deep and concluded I was not bi polar but I suffered from adult ADHD (33 year old male). It makes total sense as I read more about ADHD. I had been on every possible anti-depressant, anti psychotic MDD etc and was just done with meds. I was diagnosed as a child and teen but thought “ I’d grow out of it” and apparently never did it just got worse. I feel that so many people are mis-diagnosed it’s almost unbelievable. My theory and the doctor also said that if you take the medication and it calms you and your racing thoughts that that’s a tell tail sign that you do indeed suffer from ADHD, it’s not just a childhood/school era problem, it disrupts your life, marriage everything. I’m on day 2 and it’s like a light switch has been turned on and I can relax and not be manic.	9	April 25, 2021	3
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been on and off generic Adderall for many years. Currently, I have been prescribed 30 mg twice a day. For the last couple of months, it's been a nightmare. It's been on backorder and then changed the generic name from amphetamine salts combo to amphetamine/ dextroamphetamine combo. This is only because I have had severe headaches, extreme fatigue, and a loss of motivation. My ADHD has been out of the roof. It's frustrating because I feel like I did before taking any generic Adderall. I have even been concerned that maybe I was receiving a placebo rather than the actual medication. That's probably far-fetched, but it's been such a decline for me. There is something missing from this generic form and it is the essential thing that is needed to control my ADHD. I have even gained a lot of weight over the past two months. Hopefully, something will give, I can't imagine it affecting people like this and nothing changing.	3	April 19, 2021	8
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	This pill does not work like any Adderall that I have experienced. There is neither the focus or the energy bump that is typically associated with the two most therapeutic aspects of the formulation. The vast majority of time I feel equally as sleepy and unfocused as I did when I took it.    I am an experienced user of this positive life-changing medication. The patients that us this medication are in a bad position when company’s that make inferior generic medications are allowed distribution rights through equally as corrupt retail pharmaceutical outlets seeking to make a few pennies extra per script, on the back of patients whose experienced opinion is rarely considered.	2	April 17, 2021	2
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I have taken ADHD meds many years. Adderall XR is the ADHD med that works the best for me. I am taking a generic manufactured by Lannett. It by far has worked the best for me with the reason(s) being is the smoothness, the come up is very quick, and it does it's job perfectly.   To reiterate, Lannett is very smooth with a quick come up, and last long enough most days.	9	April 15, 2021	4
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	If anyone else is having a terrible time with the new Lannett generic adderall you can report this to the FDA.  I have been having crippling headaches, stomach aches, and the medication doesn’t even feel like it works!!! I get tired after I take it and then can’t sleep all night because of it. HORRIBLE. Google fda medwatch online reporting to fill in the form	1	April 9, 2021	33
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Right now I take 50mg Lamictal for my Bipolar and 7.5mg twice a day Adderall for ADHD. At first I wasn't sure Adderall was going to work for me, I was initially prescribed 20mg twice a day.  That dose ended up being way too high for me, It made be become manic and I felt really wired all the time.  I now take 7.5mg twice a day and have found it to be much better. I feel alert and focused throughout the day.  Some of the side effects I have had are weight loss, jaw clenching, and mild insomnia (I usually just take melatonin). Overall, Adderall has helped me a lot, I just had to find the right dosage.	8	April 8, 2021	0
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been on Adderall for several years and the Sandoz brand is TOXIC and HORRIBLE! At first it is like a sugar pill no effect and then dizziness, headache, feeling more confused, spaced out and mind blank, extreme fatigue. I can't believe this is on the market. FDA honestly needs to step up their game and monitor the generics. It is a up and down roller coaster with different manufactures each month. This is insane. They are robbing us blind in the pharmaceutical business. They give us something toxic or a placebo. What is happening to the medications now. Please do not take the Sandoz. Read the court documents about reviews on them and they came from the company. Making themselves sound great as a pretend customer!! I can not believe how bad this medication from this manufacture is.	1	April 6, 2021	10
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Worked really well for the first week or so, but then really made me more irritable and gave me uncontrollable suicidal urges that ultimately sent me to the hospital. The suicidal urges stopped after dropping the medication.  I wouldn't recommend against the medication, I would just proceed with caution as the side effects can vary in intensity from person to person.	1	April 3, 2021	3
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I have been prescribed Amphetamine Salt Combo which has worked well(I have ADD and narcolepsy). Today I was given from RX, Amphetamine Aspertate, it make me fell kinda sickness. Was I given the wrong medicine. The prescription has not changed ?	7	April 1, 2021	3
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I’ve been on Adderrall immediate release for at least 8 years, probably more. At first Adderrall gave me an intense high and made me very talkative. Very talkative. That lasted for a few days and after that each morning when I took it it gave me a euphoric feeling for about have the day. I wasn’t making impulsive decisions like I had in the past and my focus was razor sharp. I really enjoyed this drug for sometime but the last 3-5 years it’s just been the same old same old. I take it in the morning and have somewhat of a boost in energy and focus but after around 11am the effects of the medication just wears off. I wind up feeling irritable, decent level of focus if I’m busy at work, and just downright not very social with people. This week I’m going to see my P.A. and hopefully get on Vyvanse which I was encouraged by many to try before jumping on Adderrall. Vyvanse is more expensive but I’m ready to feel more focused and more myself.	5	March 28, 2021	4
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	This review is for generic Adderall XR - amphetamine/dextroamphetamine. I've experienced wildly different effects from different manufacturers. Some days it didn't work. Some days it worked great. But I got severe debilitating headaches that lasted 24/7 and didn't go away using ibuprofen. Went to neurologist and got an MRI. If I could push past the side effects it did work well but for only about 4-5 hours after kicking in (which took about an hour). Needed a booster of IR in the afternoon, so eventually I couldn't deal with the headaches and switched to IR completely. Headaches gone almost immediately. I still get them with IR but not anywhere near as often or as bad.	6	March 23, 2021	1
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Mydayis (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	"I've tried several ADHD meds and Mydayis has definitely been the best for me. I'm on the lowest dose and it starts working 20-30 minutes after I take it. I'm then able to be productive and direct my focus easily, compared to other meds (eg-Adderall) which gave me a burst of intense focus that I had no control over. The transitions are barely noticeable and it really helps maintain consistent energy levels. After wearing off, it's a very natural ""I've worked all day and now I'm ready to relax before bed"" feeling (no crash). I also noticed it significantly helps manage my depression-something no other ADHD med has done. The only downsides: (1) it does reduce my appetite a lot and (2) it only lasts about 9-10 hours on my current dose (12.5mg), but higher doses (25mg+) give me headaches. It's not perfect, but the positives definitely outweigh the negatives for me. Lastly-you don't know how it'll affect you, so don't let reviews scare you away if you/your doc think it might help."	9	March 21, 2021	4
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I was diagnosed with ADHD at age 17 and only really started taking stimulant medication after I had turned 20 last year. I was originally trying out varying doses of IR but started trying XR in the past few months.  Overall: Hit or miss for me. It does help with my focus, but the side effects and how much it helps varies pretty drastically depending on the day. Biggest side effects are dehydration, lack of appetite, potentially crashing at night (normal). I also feel a bit uncomfortable sometimes (anxiety-ish twitchy feeling) but that's not very common.  The mallinckrodt brand I was switched to recently seems maybe a bit more hit or miss honestly I can't really tell that much of a difference (unlike people on opioids who swear that mallinckrodt is awful). I'm on 25mg for now and I'm gonna keep seeing how I feel in the coming weeks. Helps with ADHD no doubt, but do be weary of the side effects.	7	March 16, 2021	2
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Mydayis (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I took Mydayis 37.5 mg for 2 years. I just recently ran out and decided to wait a week to refill. I cannot believe the change in myself! While on it I became withdrawn and too focused on 1 specific thing. I cut out people and ruined my small business. I didn't feel human! I can't explain the feeling but now that I haven't taken it in a week I feel like myself again! I was just flesh living day by day on mydayis! I will NEVER touch it again! Please tell me there's others out there with similar experiences	1	March 12, 2021	5
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	"I have been taking teva 20mg adderall from 06-19 when they disappeared. I had already suffered from side effects from other generics due to CVS giving me a different generic a few times without consent or being informed. I did the whole google wormhole for a few months before finally seeing a random comment about ""INACTIVE"" ingredients and how this person suffered terrible side effects across multiple generic medications with this same ""INACTIVE"" ingredient. Being on multiple meds myself and having autoimmune and neuro disorders it affected my mental health knowing something wasn't right and just not grasping why & not understanding. That random comment changed everything for me ""INACTIVE"" does not equal no effect.  Teva not being an option then and now not at all I use Mallinckrodt and Arubindo 20 mg. I find it helps to switch them every couple months or I take M in the morning and A in the afternoon depending on how my body is functioning. I tried SAndoz that was terrible side effects."	8	March 6, 2021	2
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Narcolepsy	I've been on adderall 20 mg 3× a day for over 10 years from secondary narcolepsy due to a TBI. I will only take Teva there plenty of generics that don't work and are less than a 10% out of 100% I got these I think Mallinckrodt U30 on it I tried returning it after taking 3 and falling asleep they wouldn't return so I took about 7 more just to get home from the pharmacy 1hour drive without passing out it did nothing. If I took 4 Teva I'd bounce off the walls won't sleep for at least 1 day. I will never again take anything besides the Teva after sleeping for the remainder of the month. I wish I could afford the brand name. Don't listen to any pharmacist generic aren't close I can't believe they get away with saying there same as brand lol body doesn't lie. Scumbags looking for profit due not caring who suffers	9	March 5, 2021	5
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	My 7 year old son is a first grader and was recently diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. He has been recommended Adderall for this but I am a bit reluctant to initiate its usage. I have a few reservations about how long it lasts in our system which I have heard can prove to be dangerous for a young kid. I have read multiple articles like these, but I am still not so sure. Seeing the number of experienced people here, please tell me if I should continue with it.		March 4, 2021	4
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	First time taking Alvogen generic amphetamine with dextroamphetamine 30mg. Been taking adderall for 2 years but always Teva generic. Oh my God, the Alvogen brand has made me feel so sick. All over severe headache, nauseous, vomiting, diarrhea. I feel awful. No focus, no energy, can't keep anything down, running to the bathroom.	1	February 27, 2021	8
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Been taking adderall for years. Until the had me try a white stop sign shaped one by mallinckrodt since there was an adderall shortage at my Walgreens. mallinckrodt amphetamine/dextroamphetamine shouldn’t even be labeled as amphetamine/dextroamphetamine it should just be sold as a caffeine pill because all it does is wake you up subtlety. It doesn’t help with focus whatsoever. I’ve already filed a complaint with the FDA and recommend everyone else do the same	1	February 25, 2021	20
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I take the 10 mg amphetamine with dextroamphetamine by Teva and it works great, better than the 15 mg.in my opinion. I see others mentioning generics by Alogen and Mallinckrodt here. Well I take a couple of other medications manufactured by these 2, on and off, most times it's Mallickrodt. Let me tell you, this is the WORST drug manufacturer on the market. The Alogen is junk too. I've been on a few medical chat sites just to see what I can find out about Mallinckrodt and see if others felt the same way and they absolutely do! Literally 100's of people have complained to the co. itself and to the FDA. This has been going on for a solid 5 years at least & the stuff is STILL pure unadulterated JUNK.	7	February 21, 2021	23
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Mydayis (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Switched from Concerta to Mydayis for the longer duration mechanism Mydayis offers. Was started on 25mg of Mydayis. ADD symptoms improved but I experienced dry mouth, dizziness, heart increase, and appetite decrease which subsided after the first week. Second week I felt like the dose was not effective. Doc switched me to 37.5mg of the mydayis and so far symptoms of ADD improved but side effects are rough. Dry mouth, headache, dizziness, lack of appetite, increased anxiety. I’m on day 4 or 5 so hoping the side effects subside when my body adjusts to the higher dose... fingers crossed.	6	February 20, 2021	4
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I am currently on Adderall XR 30MG, and it has changed so many different aspects of my life, including depression.  I was prescribed Adderall because I was about to be terminated from my job. Back to the drug, I take it around 6am everyday, and found that my overall mood has changed. I am not as emotional as I was before, yet I am still able to express my feelings when necessary without the full breakdowns. I have been dealing with Major Depressive Disorder, and this medication has alleviated most of those feelings.  However, the medication has not been a miracle drug, and it contains no magic! For me, ADD has always been there. For me, it took me to be 36 years old to finally realize it was time to visit a psychiatrist, regardless of all the negative stigmas; I was glad I did, because it gave me many suspected answers, rather than self diagnosing situations.	9	February 15, 2021	17
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’ve taken adderall for years. I used to be on Lannett brand and Walgreens recently switched to TEVA. I had my script switched from CVS to Walgreens because it was closer to me. I have been on it for 3 months and the side effects are TERRIBLE.  I clench my teeth so bad my teeth have broken, I am severely depressed, I can’t find happiness in literally anything. I don’t feel motivated at all. If anything I feel less motivated to get out of bed. My skin is dry, my eyes are sinking in and I get terrible migraines. My anxiety is so bad I’m anti social, and I thought I had a stroke because of side effects. I’m 25. Just don’t take it		February 13, 2021	7
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I take two 30 mg pills a day for ADHD and it has really made a huge difference in my life. I am able to focus on one task at a time and complete it. Works great for giving me the motivation I sometimes lack. Only issue is that when I was given the white or peach ones, they did not seem to work as well as the pink ones. Talked to doctor about it and she added to my prescription to only receive the pink ones. Curious if anyone else has had this issue	9	February 10, 2021	34
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	ALVOGEN INC has got me all messed up. I've taken ADHD meds since 1st grade and I'm 32 now so I'm very confident in my ability to distinguish between generics that work & don't and why. For the past 4 years I've used the same CVS location to fill my Adderall tab 30mg generic the past two times though I received a pill that looked different thinking okay whatever this happens from time to time it is just a different manufacturer no big deal. I was wrong. I have had insanely high blood pressure increases, trouble sleeping, hardly any focus, SEVERE anxiety like where is feel like I can't breathe suddenly especially when I try to sleep, shaky hands, VERY noticeable heart palpitations, diarrhea, headaches and  weird emotional ups & downs. I've been vegan for 3 months now at first I was seeing a steady decrease in blood pressure but as soon as I started taking this new generic I'm topping out at 161/111 at the doctor a few days ago which is just absolutely bonkers and terrifying	2	February 9, 2021	9
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’ve taken TEVA adderall 20 mg IR for the past 2+ years. It worked greatly for my ADD & as an anti-depressant. HOWEVER, it has changed! Starting July 2020, the TEVA tablet was completely different. It was no longer sweet, the consistency was harder & the efficacy was compromised. I can take it & fall asleep hours later & there is ZERO anti-depressant effect. In fact, it deepens my depression.  I will submit a report to the FDA & I encourage everyone else to. Also, please research the complaints of TEVAs other generics. I’m not sure what to try next. I tried the Sandoz and it was actually worse. I received the hideous Zydus once-which gave me a migraine & intensely aching back.I believe it’s manufactured out of this country.  This experience has made me question ALL generic medications.   Please start researching yours & refuse to take these.  I tried switching to name brands but my ins. refuses to pay.	2	February 8, 2021	11
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Have used a generic for about 6 years now worked for me except it has turned me into a teeth grinder I do it all the time and now my teeth are worn to the point they are ruined.  My doctor said he never heard of that side effect but a recent visit to a dentist to try to fix my teeth I was told they see this all the time and this grinding may never go away. I need to find something that works without these side effects	6	February 4, 2021	9
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine)	My cardiologist who diagnosed me with dysautonomia prescribed me adderall in high school because my symptoms included extreme fatigue, brain fog, and *bad* orthostatic hypotension. He did not warn me about all the side effects I would experience (due partly to the fact that I do not have ADHD), and I was given a high dose to start. It did help with my fatigue and immensely improved my focus (can’t complain there, I was *hyper* focused), brain fog, and hypotension, but there were some questionable side effects I experienced for the almost 2 years I took it: complete lack of appetite, significant weight loss, resting tachycardia and angina (my dysautonomia makes my HR very high to begin with) Overall it definitely improved my quality of life for a time but it seems like a questionable Rx for people with this condition who are hyper adrenal, already experiencing an overactive sympathetic ANS, and have a high HR due to the cardio effects.	7	January 27, 2021	3
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I’ve been in this medication for almost a year . And it change my life in good way. Made me focus on my goals and I want to achieve and increased my motivation to become better person also balance my mood and decreased my depression.	9	January 19, 2021	14
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been taking Teva amphetamine/dextroamphetamine (adderall generic) for quite sometime for ADHD. In the last year, I noticed right away something was off. First was the obvious color. The Teva that has always worked for me with no problems (that was being weaned out in 2019) was as follows..  peach color and sweet, easy to swallow and not gag on. Teva now, is orange. The sweet taste that made it bearable to take has changed completely. My focus, clarity, motivation, and concentration has been/is immensely effected by the new ingredient change. (I don't have it at all)  My overall mental health, has declined quickly. It has caused my mood to completely change, headaches are constant, and upset stomach. All of this, and they don't even work. I struggle everyday now. Less main ingredient and more fillers means more pills can be produced, which means more money in the manufacturer's pocket..... Mental health should be top priority, especially being consistent with and not changing the ingredients.	1	January 17, 2021	50
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	This month is the first time I received sandoz adderall ER and it doesn't seem to work very well for me. Mallinckrodt doesn't seem to work too well for me either. I think Teva seems to work the best for me; even better than the name brand for adderall.	6	January 17, 2021	2
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I have suffered with ADHD since I was a young kid, I got diagnosed at the youngest age possible and I never got any help for it by my old doctor.  With my new doctor, he gave me Adderall XR to start out with 10 and than up it to 20 within a week if not effective.   I am on 20 MG now and it has changed my life, I failed school and life because I couldn't pay attention and now not only can I pay attention but this has also helped as my ADHD had caused Depression/Anxiety also OCD.	10	January 15, 2021	14
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Generic Adderall varies significantly depending on mfg. Reason being, the FDA says the mfg only has to “demonstrate” it “works in the same way “ as the brand-name. i.e. generic ingredients do  Not have to be same which is why so many don’t work and/or make people feel sick. My experience, the only generic that works like the brand-name is Prasco, which acquired Teva’s generic xr in 2016.  Few pharmacies use Prasco as their generic because it’s more expensive!  My Dr specifies “Prasco generic only” on my prescription for D-Amphetamine ER 30MG Salt combo. By law, the pharmacy must comply if Prasco is one of their overall suppliers. My insurance changed so I called Prasco to see if they sell to Costco. They do. Just takes a day or 2 for the pharmacist to order and fill my script. Walgreens used Prasco as their generic until recently. Now it’s Mallinckrodt which just filed for bankruptcy to settle a slew of opioid lawsuits. It’s all about $		January 8, 2021	59
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	The adderall name brand is 2-3 times better than generic adderall XR. The FDA should be inspecting these generic companies and make sure they are getting as high of quality ingredients. I urge anyone in generics to try real adderall for a month then decided for yourself. Decide to report the generics because we should be able to get a cheaper still 90$ for generic compared to $220+ for name brand.	10	January 7, 2021	18
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’m a doctor with ADHD. I’ve been on the generics to cut costs during tough times but I insist on the name brand adderall. No only is it smoother it lasts longer and helps even more than the generics. It’s a shame that cost is a bearing on necessary prescriptions and that generic are so much weaker and poorer quality. Generic adderall needs to step it up they have quality issues and their recipe is somehow flawed.	5	January 7, 2021	25
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for Narcolepsy	I was diagnosed with a severe case of narcolepsy about a year ago. I always thought it was my chronic fatigue that made me feel so sleepy all the time. I was finally referred to a sleep specialist who ordered a night and day time sleep study. When I received the results he told me I was a very sleepy person, his worst case in many years. I have been taking 20MG Adderall 3x a day. It does help but I'm still extremely tired throughout the day. The sleep doctor advised me in September that there's a newer medication that can be added to my Adderall but insurance didn't like to approve it and that in 6 months hopefully it will be easier to prescribe. I've seen somewhere that 60MG a day is the max for treating ADHD but that 90MG is the max for treating narcolepsy. I'm curious if that dose would improve my symptoms. Overall I'm happy with the medication as I never notice any side effects. I just want to feel more awake and less sleepy.	7	January 6, 2021	9
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)		Alvo Adderall sucks. It doesn’t work at all. I'm so annoyed that  my month will suck while taking this brand	1	January 4, 2021	4
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Mydayis (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I've only been taking it for 3 days but I can understand now when people say they feel it running in the background. So far no side effects other than appetite loss. I do feel energy from this but not like Adderall there's no anxiety tied to the energy its more like motivation than energy. One thing I've noticed is I like to always be doing something that is productive in some way. It's not the type of energy you get and use to dance or workout you feel driven to get things done.  It last for the whole 16 hours which surprised me I'm an ultra rapid metabolizer. I have no crash on this like I did with Adderall. I'm just waiting for my period now to see how the cramps are and giving the medicine more time to see if I do have any side effects, so far none but no appetite.	10	January 3, 2021	11
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I've been taking dextroamp-amphet ER 15mg once a day for roughly 3 months now and it's helped me greatly until 2 weeks ago and it's as if I cut my dose by 3/4! Is this normal and what dose, frequency, and type of adderall should I change to? I've heard about generic vs name brand, so what do the best ones look like?	6	December 30, 2020	1
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I've been prescribed adderall for 10yrs+ and without it mentally and physically I would be worse. I do have soreness, achy body, etc but have other health problems. Adderall has ROTTED MY TEETH OUT. Being 42 years old, fear ability to retain with out medicine as I age. I have severe withdrawal, to include extreme fatigue, severe constipation. I need the Adderral and helps some as without it life would be more difficult. All and all I would not manage without it very well but it is less effective as been taking for years. Take care and God Bless All. Be Safe!	7	December 24, 2020	10
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Narcolepsy	I take the regular Adderall 20mg in the morning, but do 10mg in the afternoon; along with my other prescribed stimulants since mornings are the hardest for me. I got a new prescription and after a couple days of feeling like complete rubbish and having unscheduled naps each day, I noticed it was different.   After having the name brand and suddenly switching to this generic; it made sense why I suddenly felt like I could never wake up, even on 480mg of stimulants each day. Even as I write this at almost 11pm, I have felt like I can't do anything but lay down and nod off throughout the day.  These generics are different and affect our quality of life. When your treatment works and suddenly you feel like you aren't even taking your medicine because of a sudden switch to a placebo-like generic is a huge problem.  Where is the consistency for these medications!?	1	November 30, 2020	25
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for Narcolepsy	Adderall worked well for a year then it wore off even with medication free holidays. When trying a new medication and stopping I didn’t realize how out of breath it was making me, I thought it was because I was fat.	3	November 25, 2020	7
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Fatigue	I just tried Alvogen brand of amphetamine/dextroamphetamine this month because my pharmacy. It is absolutely awful. I feel like my body is screaming, absolutely doesn’t help with energy or attention. Just increases anxiety. And I’m extremely lethargic. I strongly recommend against them.	1	November 25, 2020	27
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Regarding the post by DrKatz on 11/7/2020:.  I too take the 20 mg salt combo- manufactured by Teva, and have been on that specific brand for two and a half years.  I can definitely concur that something has changed with their product.   I am on a prescription of 80 mg a day and I too noticed a difference in taste, consistency of the pill itself, and it not working as well as it used to.  I am aware of a recall May 22nd by Teva for a few of their doses- the 20mg pill being one of them.   Thinking placebo, I inspected the pill closely: the depression level of the imprint is different, slight change in the oblong shape, the edging* (*like the cut/side profile of floor boards) and thickness + curvature.   The taste difference (bitter) I noticed in August. October back to normal but currently (Nov.) the taste changed again- however this time with a much greater chemical profile- like bactine or rubbing alcohol, more crumbly and not working as well for either my ADHD or narcolepsy.	8	November 15, 2020	29
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I’ve been on Adderall XR 20 mg since October 6th 2020. I have to say this medication is life changing and your psychiatrist, doctor or whatever will try and find the right dosage for you. I’m 22 years old, Male and I noticed the medication working within an hour, I’m about 220 pounds 5’8 and despite that it still kicked in relatively fast. The side affects I notice the most are as follows dry mouth, appetite suppression, some irritability, and insomnia on occasion. Adderall XR for me last anywhere from 8-12 hours, if it wears off the medical professional in most cases will add Adderall IR to take in the afternoon, since upping the dose of XR will not increase duration only the intensity of the medication itself. ADHD medication is all about finding what’s right for YOU, don’t give up if it doesn’t get manageable or fixed after the first try.	9	November 8, 2020	41
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have always used Teva Adderall IR because I have had horrible experiences with other generic, including inconsistency and lack of potency.  Understand that I have taken Teva Adderall 20MG tablets over five years, thus it would less difficult for someone like me to detect subtle changes in its effects.  I have noticed the following, and this started around September 2020.  Teva generic Adderall tablets seem (and this is very subtle) smaller in size. Second: Teva is known for its slight sweet taste. It is almost as if that is completely  gone... I’m certainly not saying that added anything to it, but I’m saying it’s an indicator  of some sort of formula change.  Finally, although the 20MG tablet is small, it used to be easy to half the tablet. Recently they just crumble. To summarize, I have also noted a very marked decrease in efficacy.	7	November 7, 2020	26
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Adderall XR is Life changing (positively). I went from being massively distractable and procrastinate constantly to getting things done. I'm not just referring to school work or office work. I mean just showing up on time to meet up with friends. Not getting instantly bored with family.  I truly love it!   --- Quick warning, take it as your doctor recommends! So much of the bad press comes from people abusing the drug.  Likewise, if you're able, take a day off now and then. Perhaps on days when you don't need to work or do much. It's sort of like coffee/tea/caffeine in that sense. Fine if you do take it everyday, but probably best if you give your mind/body a rest from it now & then.  Just like running or exercise, you need light or rest days each week to really get the most from the workout.	10	November 6, 2020	33
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	My grades instantly went from the 60s and 70s to 90s and 100s and for once I felt like I had control over my life. The side effects were pretty bad and inconsistent though, so I had to go from 20 to 15 mg.	9	November 4, 2020	18
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine)	My son had been on every ADHD meds made by mankind since he was 5. He is 17 now, and because I go read reviews after the doctor changes his meds. I thought it might help someone who has went through all of them also. Adderall was the worst . My son was happy, enteric, easy go lucky and even on daytrana.  Ritalin, foculian, etc. he never lost himself. On adderall he was drowning mentally. Depression set in, moodiness, anger, punching walls, so mad he would black out, etc. Be very careful !!!!! Do not choose this one if you but all help it!	1	October 26, 2020	9
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	The Adderal dose my doctor prescribed didn't seem to work that great(20 mg twice a day)  One day I had it after my oatmeal and it was more effective so after that I just scrunched up the pill like I did with oatmeal, but I didn't put it on anything.  I just took it like that. Works great!  Much more motivation to get tasks done so I can finish more!  Maybe you could try that if it sees not enough to work.  I use Sandoz.	10	October 11, 2020	20
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for Narcolepsy	I was switched to Adderall but after 2 years switched to Ritalin. Adderall seems to open up parts of your brain best left closed. I started to see a 12 year old boy in the yard during the day he would be gone when I went to talk with him. My neighbors told me that in the 1970s he died here. You have to watch the dosage	10	October 10, 2020	26
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for Narcolepsy	I have been soooo sleepy for the past 15 years of my life. I finally found a PA that listened to me about my sleepiness. She has been great. I can not afford the recommended sleep study. I am currently taking 10mg extended release. It has helped but I am still falling asleep at work. My PA will meet with me in after a month on it. I’m not sure if I need an increased dosage or if it’s not working on me. It’s a struggle still. I don’t want to feel hopeless that I can’t find help.	6	October 9, 2020	11
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Adderall XR was originally prescribed to me for ADD, but it worked best as a terrific antidepressant.  However, now that I've been on it for 20 straight years at 40-80 mg. Daily, it has very little antidepressant effect now. It's Adderall burnout -- apparently it strips the brain of dopamine -- the feel-good hormone.        I still have to take it just to do anything at all each day.  The worst effect is insomnia -- no matter how early I take it.  It keeps me up for 24 hours unless I finally have to take Seroquel for sleep.  Seroquel is the only thing that will knock out Adderall XR.  But I hate it because it makes me so damn sluggish in the morning, awful.        I cannot believe it's 2020, and there is still no decent antidep medication available,	8	October 1, 2020	31
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	The last 9 months generic “Zydus” was the only brand of amphetamine/dextroamphetamine available in my area. I noticed pretty nasty side effects beginning 45 minutes after consumption. I’ve never felt depression so severely before taking Zydus. Teva/Barr has returned. Felt a night and day difference the first day. Hope Zydus gets banned for the safety of us all.	1	September 23, 2020	20
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Stressed and depressed and always angry.	7	September 21, 2020	23
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Mydayis (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I switched over to Mydayis in hope of finding something that could last the entire day. My days are usually nonstop for approx 16 hours. I started at the lowest dose and went up to the 50mg after 3 weeks. Gave it a few more weeks in hopes that it would work like how we wanted it to. The negative side effects outweigh the positives. The first thing I noticed was ejaculatory anhedonia. It led to an unplanned pregnancy before I caught it. The rest included falling behind in classes and not being able to keep up at work. Felt lazy and not wanting to do anything. It was like being unmedicated all over again!	4	September 21, 2020	8
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine)	I am so confused but feeling better just knowing I am not alone. I am very sensitive to any changes in medication. I have been on 10 mg twice daily for about 10 months. The pharmacy has switched generic brands multiple times. I did well on one made by Sun Industries but am not doing well on Teva. Apparently they make the name brand which I didn’t know until tonight. I would also like to know how we can change the way generics are approved. The variations are laughable and can really cause problems. I’m hesitant to switch to a different generic because what always happens is they stop making it or the pharmacy can’t get it. I requested name brand so at least it’s consistent. Any suggestions? So frustrated! Best to you all.	7	September 21, 2020	41
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for Narcolepsy	This medicine is god send. I have been suffering with narcolepsy for about 5 years. Had no idea what I was doing wrong that I cannot keep my eye open. I am talking about sleeping for 8-9 hours and then waking up and wanting to go back to sleep. I am a public school teacher and I had no choice but to be at work all day. That was a struggle and I was embarrassed to even tell my coworkers. This summer, so many unpleasant events happened in my life, I decided to talk to my psychiatrist about unable to concentrate and the excessive sleeping pattern. He wanted me to try adderall and bam!! I haven’t taken a nap since August . I do not have any side effects, not glittery, no overworking , nothing. Just ready to start the day and get in with my life. I usually go to bed around 9:30pm and sleeps well. I take 20 mg twice a day. But if you miss a dose, back to square one. I am religiously on a schedule and take them at the same time everyday. I am in my mid 40’s.	10	September 17, 2020	38
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Generic Adderall:  TEVA vs. ALVOGEN “All generic adderall is NOT the same trust me!...... I don’t care what your physician or pharmacist may say.“  I’ve taken Adderall for nearly 25 plus years for ADD.  WHY? it works twice as good ask anyone whose taken different brands before. For the BEST quality and most potent adderall on the market is made by a company called TEVA.  Even pharmacist tell me when they run out of TEVA and must use ALVOGEN their patients complain because the pharmacies cannot keep TEVA in stock because the consumers know it’s the best and most effective for ADD and ADHD.	1	September 15, 2020	131
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have taken both Adderall and its generic(amphetamine/dextroamphetamine) for over 16 years for my Adult Attention Deficit Disorder. I have found that the original Adderall has the best effectiveness and in these last 4 tears Teva [still oval, peach/orange color] working the best for my A.D.D. Pills made by Mallinkrodt I only get by mistake, and still act like a placebo in May 2020. Dose: 20mg. X 2 daily.		August 25, 2020	24
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I do not like this formula. I have been on various generics for years and did not feel like this 10 mg did anything. Unfortunately, I've already filled this prescription and am stuck with this medication.	1	August 24, 2020	7
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been taking Adderall for most of my adult life and Walgreens always carried the generic version that worked best for me but recently they changed who they get it from now and the new amphetamine / dextroamphetamine from Lannett MFG SUCK!  They do not work at all - actually the worst next to the  YELLOW ROUND Mp 447's, PINK ROUND Cor 136's, or OCTAGON WHITE ONES.   The TEVA amphetamine/dextroamphetamine Peach Oval B 974's are the ones that work best for me and now I don' t know how to get them - Help..	10	June 16, 2020	93
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	My concern in taking generic Adderall IR for several years is the effect is has on my heart  When I take it, at the prescribed dose,  I most always have sinus tachycardia  (a heart rate above 100 beats per minute)  I also have noticed that it effects bladder emptying....and my urinary stream seems slower (and I am fairly young) and I am not usually able to completely empty my bladder.	6	June 10, 2020	26
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Since the shortage for about 3 months I've been taking generic Zydus 20mg. How do these drugs pass inspection? I think a couple pixie sticks would work better. I wonder if generic adderall from any manufacturer will ever get better. I think charging over $5.00 for this rubbish should be criminal.	1	June 7, 2020	40
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	This medication amphetamine/dextroamphetamine has made me feel VERY JITTERY and sick to my stomach! I take generic TEVA brand orange tab 30 mg. The pharmacy didn’t have any of the TEVA brand so they gave me generic U31 tablet - Aurolife Pharma, LLC brand. This is horrible! People take time off work to be seen by doctor, get put on meds for a reason, spend money for the appointment and meds, all the time you spend doing this & it can’t be returned back to Walmart to get my right medicine because “it’s against the law” supposedly! Even when I have the entire prescription (minus one) to give them back. Why make people feel like this when they do so much to try and make life easier being on their meds. I don’t have insurance so my doc visit is almost $100 & medicine is around $60 every month. My 7 year old daughters meds were switched as well. I’m scared to even give her medicine! How can Walmart just give you a different brand that you’ve never taken and not tell me before I leave it’s different!?	1	June 5, 2020	67
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Fatigue	I have been through about all anti-depressants, mood stabilizers, and anti-psychotics for my severe treatment-resistant depression and this medicineamphetamine/dextroamphetamine has saved me. Honestly, I have horrible anxiety as well. I have Chronic PTSD and Generalized Anxiety Disorder. This medicine calms my nerves as well. I can actually take naps during the day now when I need to instead of not being able to rest. It helps my impulsiveness from my Bipolar Disorder that is included in my Schizoaffective diagnosis. I may have to deal with the hallucinations but this medicine is the only medicine that works for me in the most positive way. For me, it has way less severe side effects than any medicine I have tried. It mainly helps with my energy levels which helps my depression because I feel more useful I also am more social which helps my confidence. The only thing I struggle with is the lack of appetite and it seems like water goes right through me. But, It is definitely a life saver for me. <3	10	May 3, 2020	32
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I am a male in my thirties. Adderall is the third drug I tried to tread ADHD after doing trials on Vyvanse and Concerta. Vyvanse worked but did not last long enough and I had bad crashing (headache, exhaustion). Concerta did not work for me at all, made me lethargic and even more distracted.  Adderall at 20mg a day gives me energy to focus on work and my kids. It lasts me until sometime in the evening. I have trouble sleeping some nights on it, other than that the side effects are negligible.	8	May 3, 2020	43
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Activist Dextramp-amphet ER (30 mg.) [ generic for Adderall ]  is HORRIBLE. NOT effective. Causes nausea. HORRIBLE. I have taken this drug for over 3 years and I know what it is supposed to do.	1	April 30, 2020	40
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for Narcolepsy	Generic Adderall is not the same. I feel immediately awful when I realize they switched me to generic dextro amp (amp salts works not sure what brand. I heard Teva might have moved distribution centres and have been alternating approved cheaper alternative ingredients. Well guess what they don’t work AT ALL. Check the generic brands when you get your script filled and see how you feel. The old generic brand I took worked just fine. I cannot get out of bed for weeks because whatever “similar” generic cheap alternatives they are using do not make the cut. Welcome back debilitating fatigue!	6	April 12, 2020	129
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Adderall is very useful but recently I was ignorant and thought it would be okay to take a little extra at night to help clean my house. I took a bigger extra dose then I should have and a few hours later I felt pretty awful. I am very productive and more positive on the right dose of this med, so I recommend trying it or Desoxyn, because it is said to have fewer side effects like anxiety and panic and irritability post dose. Like all meds, Adderall is a blessing when dosed right and a curse when dosed incorrectly. I noticed that I paced around a bit when on it but I didn’t feel that anxious. It isn’t fun and enjoyable to take a big dose, don’t do it. God made everything to be used in moderation and it is much better for the whole society when we obey the wise instructions of our doctors and leaders. Be careful, obey your doctor, and may God bless you all to succeed in your treatment plans and in your lives. Amen	8	March 18, 2020	74
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	These batches have to improve. I can't even focus on anything and have narcolepsy.	1	March 10, 2020	35
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Recently changed pharmacies and didn't realize that there can be quite a difference between generics. For 4 years I’ve taken adderall 2x day, 10 mg. Never any problems until I switched pharmacies to save $.  Elite Pharma is who makes this new one and it is NOT GOOD.   I am lethargic, unable to focus, quite sleepy.  It’s as if I haven’t even taken anything.  Incredibly frustrating as I am not even half way through this months supply.	1	March 7, 2020	50
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	The generic manufacturer of amphetamine & dextroamphetamine, Sandoz, is the only one that works for me. This month the manufacturer is Northstar and last month Aurobindo, and they are garbage. They don’t help AT ALL with my focus. Zero.  I am irritable. I am getting nothing done and my anxiety is sky high. I am going to stop taking these brands and ask pharmacy for Sandoz.  I complained to the FDA and urge others to do so as well. This is ridiculous.	1	March 3, 2020	70
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Adderall has worked great for me when taken as needed. When I was in my early 20’s and taking it daily I built up a dependence that lead to terrible withdrawals as it is very addictive. (Learned the hard way and never want to go through that again!)  I will usually only take this when my ADHD symptoms are unbearable and my work/personal life starts to become affected. We are talking maybe 1-4 tablets max per month.  It really does help with focus and energy, and I find that one 10-20mg dose is usually enough and I feel good for several days after the dose without any withdrawals or dependence issues.

ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Laura, CVS in Kansas City and probably elsewhere exclusively carry SANDOZ. With goodrx my 60 tablets of 20mg are 28$	9	February 22, 2020	32
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	If you're taking for ADHD please note there are a lot of side effects, having said this, they are sometimes serious so take note to talk to your doctor. If you get cold fingers or toes, make sure to consult your doctor as it's a syndrome that can be prevented.  It does help with focus, it helps with impulse control, it helps with a general overall euphoric feeling and it can cause you to lose a lot of weight. Be sure to eat, EAT, don't shake your head, you know I'm talking to you. Eat and stay hydrated it causes you to urinate a LOT, make sure to supplement what you are losing. It will cause tremors, shakes, and irritability, again, eat food. Make sure to stick to a 2000 calorie diet AT LEAST. May cause muscle fatigue and extreme soreness, stay hydrated, make sure of this.  Some say it causes better grades in school, well, to an extent. It just makes you write a lot. Eat Eat Hydrate And maybe take melatonin to help promote rest. I warned and entertained you.	7	February 21, 2020	97
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	My daughter developed tardive dyskinesia, a permanent drug-induced movement disorder, while on Adderall. If your kid has ODD, stay away from all stimulates; they are most at-risk.	1	February 19, 2020	26
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I totally agree that the new A 79 generics are no good.  I mean they work a little bit, but I feel taking the same amount of the other oblong orange ones that taste like sweet we’re way better.  These taste like nasty chalk.    I’ve never had adderal brand though so I wouldn’t that difference.	3	February 19, 2020	25
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I have been on  adderal 15mg 2×daily  for 7 yrs it has completely change my life.  I  was always down, depressed, unmotivated, impulsive, always day dreaming, short attention span, no focus and couldn't sitting still. Adderal has given me a new happy life that I can enjoy and appreciate. Starting to think I need to go up to 20mg. I can feel I'm getting used to them. But without them I wouldn't get out of bed and would waste my life.I  think adderal is my miracle drug I have never been so grateful for a prescription drug	10	February 17, 2020	111
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I was diagnosed with ADHD combined type and have tried Ritalin and Focalin. Both weren't that great for me so my doctor prescribed me 10 mg of Adderall XR. Adderall has made me have better multitasking skills and helped me pay attention. It hasn't really helped with being hyper or being impulsive and has given me bad twitching eyes. It also has made my sleep schedule weird so watch out for that.	6	February 6, 2020	23
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Picked up amphetamine with dextroamphetamine medicine 1/24/20, bottle said Barr brand? But Teva tabs were inside. Teva bought Barr in 07. Before Teva bought out multiple companies and started using their ingredients within the last 2-3 years, they were great. Sandoz and Corepharma have been the only other decent makers, before they were bought out. I haven’t noticed a thing from picking these up 1/24. The worst medicine I’ve had from Teva in 8 years.	1	February 4, 2020	36
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	On 1/24/2020 I received Teva generic IR Adderall like I usually have for the last 7 years off and on (used to be good.) Except Barr was labeled on the bottle for the first time ever. Not sure why since Teva bought Barr in 07. Regardless it isn’t any better, by far the worst I’ve had of Teva. But every other company is pathetic. Brand works 10X better but 10X pricier. If the FDA enforced the rule of not less than 80% and no more than 125% concentrated effectiveness, that would be a first! The right MG of each dose might be regulated, but the fillers/inactive ingredients added is the big issue. 1-3 used to be in the old Barr/ Shire/ Sandoz/ Core and those worked fantastic. Every generic now has 5-8 fillers that make it less effective but also cause severe side effects. FDA could care less about small market drugs.	1	February 3, 2020	50
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Game changer. First DX by A pdoc: ADHD. What, no?  Yes.  I felt like I was only working with one puzzle piece and finding out about ADHD was like being given the other 999 pieces. At first Adderall IR didn’t seem to do much but I slowly realized it was like putting emotional and mental blinders on where I could see the rest of the world but mainly focus on the task at hand. Job saver for sure.  Since I have a high tolerance to meds XR saved me from constantly trying to remember to take next dose when I started crashing. Tops.	10	February 3, 2020	30
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I have found the generic brand for Adderall is not effective as the brand name. The Epic brand caused me to have severe depression, blurred vision, headaches, very tired and no focus at all.  I’m trying to find a brand that is much like the name brand. Looking for suggestions if anyone can share please. Thanks	1	January 29, 2020	95
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I went to pharmacy to pick up my Adderall generic brand Zydus. I was told they was out of my brand. I was given the Epic brand. The Epic brand caused me to have severe depression and I stayed in bed, I’ve always been very energetic. I stopped taking it. I called the Pharmacist and reported the side effects I had. Pharmacist didn’t act surprised at all, stated we are out of your regular brand and probably won’t get it back in.	1	January 28, 2020	18

ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	"I was so glad to see these posts.  Pharmacies are so rude to me. I switched to so many brands, but they say they are all alike, and say it doesn't matter which generic I get, because they're all the same.  My doctor, unfortunately, thinks the same.  I finally said to the pharmacy tech one day, ""I'm sure I'm not the only one, who would like certain generics."" She said, no, I'm the only one. I know this sounds crazy, but the blue 10mg of teva, don't seem to work like the 15mg of the peach teva, even if I cut one of the blue in half to make it 15mg."	8	January 23, 2020	90
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I was taking 15mg of generic Adderall  amphetamine / dextroamphetamine  for 3 months and by the end of the 3rd month I had 3 separate people tell me I didn't seem myself. I'm a regularly joyful and excited person but every emotion I had felt muted or stunted while on amphetamine/dextroamphetamine. I stopped talking it and 3 days later felt so much better. I was joyful again! Back to pinging all over the place but at least I'm happy doing it lol. I'm trying Concerta next.	4	January 21, 2020	3
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Ok so I have Both Narcolepsy/Extreme Fatigue & ADD. The generic forms of Adderall (amphetamine and dextroamphetamine) seem to be getting worse and worse. They are making them with obviously cheaper so-called similar ingredients but the new generic amphetamine and dextroamphetamine drugs just have bad side effects and don’t work for me at all or are far less effective. I don’t know if it is Teva brand that is making these cheap ineffective knock-offs that cause migraines & other side effects but they are definitely not working or decent. The generic form Amphetamine Salts works just fine for me but again I think when Teva took over and apparently used far cheaper Ingres there is definitely a disconnect because I don’t think Dextroamp-Amphetamin is a worthy generic form of Adderall but maybe just because Teva brand seems to be using incredibly cheap ingredients,	10	January 20, 2020	21
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Mydayis (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I've had ONE DOSE.  Let me be clear.  I took one 25mg pill 6 hours ago and I'm so sleepy I can't see straight.  I slept 7.5 hours last night so I don't understand the drowsiness.	5	January 9, 2020	33
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’ve been on adderall for a few years now and it was life changing. I’ve always been prescribed a generic and have never had a problem until recently. I noticed that I was not getting the same benefit as I was previously and for months, tried to convince myself that it was in my head and then one month, I noticed everyday that I felt great! Looked at the pill imprint and what do you know - it was a different manufacture (Amneal) than the one I was taking. I started googling it and saw a lot of complaints for generic Adderall from Global Pharmaceutical. I’m talking to pharmacist today about it and requesting the generic by Amneal Pharmaceuticals. I thought they were all the same and it’s a shame that global can make these any less effective than what they should be. Is it so people go to their dr, say they don’t feel the effects of it and get an increase? Sounds like a big pharma thing to do. Trust your gut instinct because you’re the person who knows you best.	1	January 8, 2020	17
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for Narcolepsy	I have #IdiopathicHypersomnia & #narcolepsy. Not all generics are equal  1. #Corepharma works 2. Oval, peach #Teva does not  3. Teva started carrying same dark pink, round IR as #Corepharma  4. In 2018 Teva selling the oval, peach again 5. I filled the Rx with #Sandoz (round, peach) worked almost as well 6. Corepharma was purchased by #Epic.  7. I have been relying on Sandoz since 2018  Every month I have to call pharmacies see if Sandoz is in stock. Usually they don't have it & can't to order it. #JewelOsco is the ONLY pharmacy that places orders for me.   Today (01/05/2020), JewelOsco does not have any &  unable to place an order; the supplier is out & the date available is TBD  Has anyone tried #Northstar? How does it compare to Sandoz?

ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	"I recently was given this new form of adderall from the pharmacy which was circular with just an ""A"" on one side... I did not like this new form of Adderall at all!! I assumed it would have the same effect as the typical oval shaped and it was completely different which is a little scary. It was very bitter and gross tasting unlike the football shaped one has a sweet note. It also disintegrated turning to powder immediately, as I attempted to break it in half (waste of product). I did not get any focus from it nor did I feel any different at all?? It did nothing! Then the next day got a horrible headache! I was talking with a friend who also mentioned getting the same thing recently. He mentioned having an extremely bad headache too the following day, so we now know it's from this form of adderall. I DO NOT LIKE IT. It should be pulled from the market honestly I don't know what the heck this rubbish  is but it is not adderall."	2	January 2, 2020	79
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Was first diagnosed with ADD(inattentive type) by multiple doctors at 18 years old. Out of the gate they prescribed me 60mg IR amphetamine with dextroamphetamine. I am now 26, taking 80mg/day, and have learned a substantial amount about this drug. No it won't make you any smarter or develop hidden talents, most believe this. The generic (dextroamphetamine-amphetamine IR) is cheaper than its brand (Adderall xr.) Obviously brand is set to higher standards of quality than generics, so yes brand name anything works better than generics, it's common sense. If you use it correctly and find the right manufacturer like Teva, you most likely won't find as many negatives as most people.	8	December 30, 2019	9
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I’ve been taking the generic version of Adderall for about 2 years now. I was tired all the time and couldn’t focus. I felt like a slug and when I had energy I still had brain fog, and had a hard time studying. In class, I would fidget in my chair, doodle, and listen to lectures, but nothing would stick in my head. No matter how long I studied.  I was prescribed the 7.5 mg tablet once a day and just the small dose did wonders for my energy levels and let me focus and actually get things done. It helped me talk in social situations and gave me a mood boost.  That being said, The generics changed a couple times. And I’m not sure, but I think I can tell a difference between them. After the pill wears off, my head aches, my legs throb, my body aches, and I’m nauseous and feel sick. I have flu like symptoms, which are miserable. It’s sad because it’s a really small dose and helps me so much but some of the side effects suck. You just gotta see what’s worth it to you.	8	December 24, 2019	61
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Fatigue	"This drug has absolutely saved my life. I have been diagnosed with severe CFS and depression approximately 14 years ago.  In 2015, I had my thyroid removed due to cancer, so I am on artificial thyroid. I could have slept for 20 hours a day and it wouldn't have been enough. I tend not to take it on weekends, as I don't need to be as ""awake"" as when I'm at work. I typically end up sleeping 12-14 hours straight on the days I don't take it. I would not be able to work full-time without Adderall. I have taken 30 mg for several years now and it has worked well for me; I have a hunch that it's because I don't generally take it on weekends, so my body gets that ""mini detox"" from it every week.   Really. This drug has saved my life. I can function again!"	10	December 5, 2019	24

ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for Narcolepsy	I was diagnosed with a sleep disorder/excessive daytime sleepiness and my physician prescribed me Adderall. After I found the dose that worked best for me (30mg in the morning and 10-20mg in the afternoon) I felt like a new person. I usually sleep anywhere from 12-18 hours a day when I don’t have classes or work (I don’t have to force myself up on these days with 2 alarms). I can still nap but they are not nearly as long as they used to be (3-8 hours). My grades have improved and most importantly, my attendance of class has improved! I used to sleep through class, but now I can go because my body isn’t begging for sleep. Overall it is an extremely helpful drug to treat narcolepsy/excessive daytime sleepiness. I finally feel like I have my life back! My only complaint is the dry mouth I experience every so often. I also still feel rather tired some days but it is not as NEAR as torturous as it used to be. Overall, it is extremely helpful and it has changed my life for the better.	10	November 20, 2019	54
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Not very effective; I took a  double dose which cause headaches and made me generally feel ill.  There are  better generics. Company should not be allowed to sell this medication.	1	November 17, 2019	13
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been on Adderal 10 mg for three months now. I have found it helps me so much in the morning. I need to talk to my doctor and see if I can get something for the afternoon. It's been a godsend but I don't have any anger issues just a lot of anxiety. I'm on Xanax as well three times a day and Ambien for sleep which really helps bed by 5 clock I'm wore out. And then my symptoms seem to return. I would recommend this to anyone that has concentration issues. I'm 41 years old and when I went to school they always called you slow. Which always made you look bad. I think my doctor he's wonderful and I'm going to get my Xanax upped and see if I can get something for the afternoon due to that I work many hours a day and I have to be on my toes.	9	November 2, 2019	6
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I got diagnosed with ADHD at the beginning of this school year, being my senior year of high school. Since 8th grade, I've struggled in school, been incredibly impulsive, had very strange eating habits, over-thought everything, and could never contain my anger or anxiety. Once prescribed, my life has changed. My grades went up, and in 3 months I've lost almost 30 pounds (I am still in the normal BMI range). I can control myself. I finally believe in myself because of Adderall.	9	October 29, 2019	79
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Well been on and off Adderall or Ritalin since I was 5. I'm 62 now, and take 60mg XR morning and two 30mg IR in the afternoon. For me it's a Godsend. I can pay attention now,  I'm more sociable, I'm just.......me.	8	October 23, 2019	22
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I’m 48 yo woman that was diagnosed with ADHD in elementary.  When I began (on holiday) taking it I’m extremely fatigue/zombie the first 3 days, I am not nearly as engaged with anyone/anything around me (I talk 97% less when I’m on Adderall) and it makes me feel less cognitive.  I feel like it dumbs me down.  After the 3rd day I start to feel better and those “tranquilizer effects” go away. Adderall is an emotional regulator for me. It works wonders for my impulsivity, racing thoughts, fidgeting, feeling overwhelmed, anger, anxiety, zoning out, and my mouth. Yes, my mouth has always been my biggest challenge and has caused me tremendous social/professional problems.  While in a perfect world I’d be on no medication, I have to recommend Adderall for anyone whose suffering from ADHD, because  it has changed my overall quality of life for the best.  Sparkle on beautiful people! 	9	October 23, 2019	81
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I was diagnosed with both bipolar and ADHD. After trying multiple combinations, we finally tried adderall on top of Wellbutrin, Lamictal, and Fluvoxamine for OCD. At first, the adderall did wonders. Completely made me enjoy life again. However, as my tolerance increased, the adderall crash was very intense. It resulted in a bipolar low almost everyday around the same time. I recently just switched to Stratetta and is my second day taking it. Anxious to see how this works.	9	October 22, 2019	29
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Mydayis (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I’ve been taking meds for ADHD/ADD close to 8 years now.  Tried Adderall at many dosages, types and amount of times per day over a period of many years.  My biggest issue. I forgot to take them.  Tried Vyvanse. It helped but I got nauseous, dizzy every day.  Tried Adderall again and forgot to take them.  One day my doctor mentioned Mydayis. I wouldn’t have to remember taking more than one in the AM.  After a week I could tell that it was helpful but wasn’t able to tell if a BIG difference.  I ran out due to scheduling once & my brain went into hyper drive. I hadn’t felt that chaotic for awhile.  WHILE talking to my doctor she legit wrote out the prescription, handed it to me. ‘go fill it NOW.’ Even had others asking how long I would be without it.  It was clear it helped at that point.  I don’t notice any side effects.  My results with Mydayis are pretty good. No worries of forgetting it, which was the major factor in my switch.	8	October 20, 2019	11
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Mydayis (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I'm making this review one year after trying Mydayis for only a week. I switched to this drug from Adderall IR 20's BID to the 37mg capsule, you don't really think your buzzing, but you indeed are, and more so than with Adderall for the same dose. What prompted me to write this review was that I noticed someone else who reviewed this mentioned that they would be returning the bottle to the pharmacy because they didn't want insurance to think they were keeping it. This is an effect of the drug, I too, even though I bought it on the $5 coupon, did not want the pharmacy (who does not care) to think that I wanted to keep this drug so I returned the remaining 23 capsules to them. It works well, puts you in a different state of mind, and doesn't provide the sense well being of some other ADHD products offer, but it does work better than some generics. Perhaps give this a try if you're on generics that don't work. It is pretty strong, but doesn't feel like it. if that makes sense.	7	October 14, 2019	12
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I was on 10MG XR for 3 months and it worked amazingly. This is a very good medication if you have trouble functioning like a normal person, although be prepared for really dark thoughts if you decide to stop taking it. Withdrawal from this drug is no joke, it can make you want to die...but if you keep taking it or taper off slowly you should be fine.		October 12, 2019	22
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I was diagnosed with ADD in 2005 after experiencing horrible distractibility in class while at college and not being able to focus on a single thought in my head.  I was prescribed Adderall IR and I remember feeling like I had drunk 5 Red Bulls or something!  My heart was pounding and I had horrible anxiety the whole day.  I only took it one time.  I decided to get off it immediately.  Soon after, I was prescribed Strattera, which didn't do ANYTHING.  I've gone for about 13 years without actual ADD medications because I really hated the idea of stimulants.  That all changed when I realized my ADD was getting out of control.  I saw my current psychiatrist last week who re-diagnosed me and we discussed my experiences.  I had read reviews from people here who say that Dexedrine works for them if Adderall made them too wired, so I asked if I could try that.  I just tried it today and I had no horrible side effects - no anxiety, no heart palpitations, no edginess, etc.  It is wonderful!	1	October 9, 2019	21
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for Narcolepsy	I was recently diagnosed with Narcolepsy in early 2019. I was started on Adderrall, but it took about 6 months to get the regimen that worked for me. I was quite sick at the stomach for about 3 months with nausea, and headaches. I take 30 mg at 9 am, and 10 mg at 1 pm. Finally, it's working well to a certain degree.  I still need at least two naps during the day and have most of my energy in the morning and early afternoon. Come 7-8 pm, I'm literally exhausted. I realized how well the medication worked after I missed a dose. I wondered why I was yawning all day and barely able to stay awake. It was because I had forgotten to take my Adderrall. Despite how well it works, I still seem to yawn almost constantly. I would not be able to get through the day without it. It's not 100 percent fix, but I can function for most of the day using it. So, that's a plus for me.	9	October 8, 2019	17
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for Narcolepsy	I was originally prescribed for adult ADD. I took it for several weeks with some results, but I soon learned that it was great for a sleep disorder as well. Recently, I stopped taking it, but soon afterward, all I could do was sleep all day. I was extremely fatigued. I had a blood test for hypothyroidism but it was negative. The only side effect for me was hypertension which I take medication for, but lately, it has been elevated. Nothing the doctor can't fix by increasing the dosage of my blood pressure med. I don't plan to stop this mediation unless I need a larger dosage to work. Currently taking Adderall XR 20mg in the morning and regular Adderall  20mg at noon. Moreover, it helps ease my craving for carbs. It works better than any antidepressant.		October 5, 2019	22
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Mydayis (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I have suffered my entire life with ADD.  For a while Adderal helped. Then as I turned 49 it seemed to make me more anxious, irritable,  short tempered, and I had No patience for stupidity! Upon trying the Mydayis,  I was immediately impressed. I was finishing projects.  Getting things done right! Able to focus for longer durations of time. Long enough to complete tasks at hand. I feel so much better.	10	October 3, 2019	30
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I will never give this to my child again!, I know all children are different but I'm sticking with Dyanavel XR. While he was on Adderall he was acting angry and violent, like he was on some kind of illegal drug, his facial expressions were intense, and he could not sit still, and was very emotional. so I have to give this a 1 star on my personal experience and my son's	1	October 2, 2019	35
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I've had a prescription for amphetamine with dextroamphetamine for  four years, and Teva used to work fairly well for me. Over the last year or so, it's become awful. I know it isn't me, because I still have old (2-3 years) pills laying around; I tried some of them and they work just fine.   Teva changed something in the manufacturing process. The new pills do almost nothing beneficial (I feel sleepy all day), but they have a ton of side effects. I feel very jittery, my stomach hurts, and I've been experiencing bloating.	1	September 30, 2019	23
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Overall, 20 mg Adderall XR for ADHD helps me to focus. The problem with adderall is it makes me sweat something awful. Anyone else annoyed with sweating while taking adderall?	9	September 28, 2019	62
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Well first off. Adderall is an Amphetamine  which assist with the production of dopamine. Very close  relation to meth. I am 21 years old and I started Adderall again. Previously I was on Adderall from age 8-13 and it worked great. Some say ADHD is not real and it just a symptom of bad health etc... I have been very very healthy and unhealthy which produced no changed in brain fog. Now that engineering is my main task in like I seem to have a hefty amount of brain fog. Adderall does in fact help with focus but the downside is the extreme crashes that happen when you stop taking it.	8	September 26, 2019	20
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been on Adderall for quite sometime. It has helped me focus and also being proactive. I recently got a new script and diff manufacturing teva  I noticed since I have taken it I'm extremely tired. Cannot focus at all I feel like a scatter brain..I had to call my dr to have him rewrite a new script and surrender the Teva (amphetamine with dextroamphetamine) Did anyone get the same reaction?	1	September 26, 2019	20
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I shared my experience recently on here and was going back over and reading others as well.  I believe we should all state the laboratory that producing the specific generic we are each taking. Doing so may help us all narrow down which ones to stay away from and which ones are truly therapeutic.  Eon lab  brand of amphetamine/dextroamphetamine was good until 9 months ago, now they are horrible (no therapeutic value and bad side effects).  I then I switched to Teva and they were decent for about 2 months and now they are giving me side effects.  Plus the pharmacy ran out of them and I had to wait for a new batch and when the new batch came in is when the bad side effect started.  I KNOW the drug manufacturer has changed something.  Hope that helps someone.	2	September 24, 2019	121
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Narcolepsy	I have been on generic Adderall (dextroamphetamine -amphetamine) for about a year and a half. I have always got the Teva brand with no issues. But in the last couple months I have noticed it not working as well. I just filled my script last week and they are even worse! I keep dozing off at work and back to taking naps in my car on lunch again. It's very frustrating! I take 30mg twice a day for narcolepsy. Last month during to the shortage on 30mg my script was shorted by 9 pills. This time the manufacturer was Alvogen and they were amazing! Only time I came across this manufacturer. I wish my insurance would cover the brand name. They denied me even with my doctor's appeal.	1	September 23, 2019	9
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for Narcolepsy	I have been on D-Amphetamine Salt Combo, 30mg a day for a few months for narcolepsy and actually did great. But I recently picked up another prescription and noticed this brand is called Teva generic brand. I have noticed for 2 weeks I have became irritated, forgetting easily in what I was looking for or talking about, aggressive outbursts, stomach pain, migraines, generalist not feeling good on this brand. I will be complaining over this!	1	September 15, 2019	50
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	So, I have had ADHD since I was like young. I never liked the pills they gave me when I was younger because I was already a thin kid and then taking Adderall I would eat even less. So I stopped taking the medication. When I was taking this medication I got most improved student! I went without the drug for years, until just about 2 years ago I started taking it again and It has helped me so much! I am very thankful for this drug. I suffer from fatigue , and many, many other problems. This drug is one of many I NEED, To Think Straight and to not get outta control.  It also helps me BIG TIME with my anger issues. Hope this helps someone! Star Kid Is OUT!	9	September 11, 2019	47
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	This drug is one of the greatest formulas of all time. I went from down and depressed and unmotivated to organized and focused. Also from relatively poor to rich due the effect it had on me with my enthusiasm for work	10	September 11, 2019	57
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I cannot believe that the FDA allows AUROBINDO or TEVA to sale their lousy drugs through pharmacies in the US.  Neither of these generics have any affect on me at all!!  WASTE of money!   They are playing with people's minds and well being!!!!	2	September 6, 2019	109
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Have taken Adderall on and off for around 13 years for ADD and CFS. I was lucky enough to have tried the “real” brand Adderall by Barr laboratories. I’ve never taken over 20mg a day. This medicine has gone to TRASH.The only negative side affect from the Barr version was occasional jaw clinching.   I think Teva must’ve burned the patent formula or something because it has never worked liked the Barr, not even close.  So many negative side effects (migraine headaches, heartburn, nausea)! I keep hoping at some point they might magically start producing a decent version that actually helps instead of hurts.  The original Barr had true therapeutic value.  Eon labs produced a decent generic for a while, but BAM, it suddenly went to garbage at the end of 2018.  So switched back to Teva a couple months back and it started ok( not as good as Eon but better than everything else out there), then last months refill is feeling like they’re changing to something bad too.  Bring back real Adderall!	3	September 4, 2019	78
ACT Amphetamine XR -  10MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I had taken Adderall for many years and was slowly on the decline.  I was deeply depressed and had an absolute hopeless and helpless outlook on life with no relief. I had psychosis, delusions and impulsive behavior which I never had. I began having issues with memory, thinking, reasoning, decision making, tasks, and  concentration.  I would become very agitated if being interrupted. I was very aggressive and agitated constantly, it was at least 98% of the time in 10 years.  I read horror stories about stimulants, namely the Amphetamine line of them. I subsequently tapered off of them and feel 100% better than before. I have no depressive symptoms, delusions, memory problems, agitation or aggressiveness. I was not happy with life and my personal relationships were very toxic. I wasted almost 10 years of my life feeling like this and have other personal complications that resulted from the use of these toxic drugs.	1	August 28, 2019	29
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I have taken Adderall XR and short acting for 25 years and I got this new XR 30MG the other day Lannett and it made me tired, heart racing, BP accelerated and did NOTHING to help me focus. I contacted the pharmacy and my Dr and he's trying to switch me to another brand because this is a joke. awful..	1	April 26, 2021	3
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Just started taking adderall XR 10mg after learning I had been mis-diagnosed for 15+ years as either bi-polar, major depressive disorder and social anxiety. I finally found a psychiatrist that really dug deep and concluded I was not bi polar but I suffered from adult ADHD (33 year old male). It makes total sense as I read more about ADHD. I had been on every possible anti-depressant, anti psychotic MDD etc and was just done with meds. I was diagnosed as a child and teen but thought “ I’d grow out of it” and apparently never did it just got worse. I feel that so many people are mis-diagnosed it’s almost unbelievable. My theory and the doctor also said that if you take the medication and it calms you and your racing thoughts that that’s a tell tail sign that you do indeed suffer from ADHD, it’s not just a childhood/school era problem, it disrupts your life, marriage everything. I’m on day 2 and it’s like a light switch has been turned on and I can relax and not be manic.	9	April 25, 2021	3
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been on and off generic Adderall for many years. Currently, I have been prescribed 30 mg twice a day. For the last couple of months, it's been a nightmare. It's been on backorder and then changed the generic name from amphetamine salts combo to amphetamine/ dextroamphetamine combo. This is only because I have had severe headaches, extreme fatigue, and a loss of motivation. My ADHD has been out of the roof. It's frustrating because I feel like I did before taking any generic Adderall. I have even been concerned that maybe I was receiving a placebo rather than the actual medication. That's probably far-fetched, but it's been such a decline for me. There is something missing from this generic form and it is the essential thing that is needed to control my ADHD. I have even gained a lot of weight over the past two months. Hopefully, something will give, I can't imagine it affecting people like this and nothing changing.	3	April 19, 2021	8
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	This pill does not work like any Adderall that I have experienced. There is neither the focus or the energy bump that is typically associated with the two most therapeutic aspects of the formulation. The vast majority of time I feel equally as sleepy and unfocused as I did when I took it.    I am an experienced user of this positive life-changing medication. The patients that us this medication are in a bad position when company’s that make inferior generic medications are allowed distribution rights through equally as corrupt retail pharmaceutical outlets seeking to make a few pennies extra per script, on the back of patients whose experienced opinion is rarely considered.	2	April 17, 2021	2
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I have taken ADHD meds many years. Adderall XR is the ADHD med that works the best for me. I am taking a generic manufactured by Lannett. It by far has worked the best for me with the reason(s) being is the smoothness, the come up is very quick, and it does it's job perfectly.   To reiterate, Lannett is very smooth with a quick come up, and last long enough most days.	9	April 15, 2021	4
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	If anyone else is having a terrible time with the new Lannett generic adderall you can report this to the FDA.  I have been having crippling headaches, stomach aches, and the medication doesn’t even feel like it works!!! I get tired after I take it and then can’t sleep all night because of it. HORRIBLE. Google fda medwatch online reporting to fill in the form	1	April 9, 2021	33
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Right now I take 50mg Lamictal for my Bipolar and 7.5mg twice a day Adderall for ADHD. At first I wasn't sure Adderall was going to work for me, I was initially prescribed 20mg twice a day.  That dose ended up being way too high for me, It made be become manic and I felt really wired all the time.  I now take 7.5mg twice a day and have found it to be much better. I feel alert and focused throughout the day.  Some of the side effects I have had are weight loss, jaw clenching, and mild insomnia (I usually just take melatonin). Overall, Adderall has helped me a lot, I just had to find the right dosage.	8	April 8, 2021	0
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been on Adderall for several years and the Sandoz brand is TOXIC and HORRIBLE! At first it is like a sugar pill no effect and then dizziness, headache, feeling more confused, spaced out and mind blank, extreme fatigue. I can't believe this is on the market. FDA honestly needs to step up their game and monitor the generics. It is a up and down roller coaster with different manufactures each month. This is insane. They are robbing us blind in the pharmaceutical business. They give us something toxic or a placebo. What is happening to the medications now. Please do not take the Sandoz. Read the court documents about reviews on them and they came from the company. Making themselves sound great as a pretend customer!! I can not believe how bad this medication from this manufacture is.	1	April 6, 2021	10
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Worked really well for the first week or so, but then really made me more irritable and gave me uncontrollable suicidal urges that ultimately sent me to the hospital. The suicidal urges stopped after dropping the medication.  I wouldn't recommend against the medication, I would just proceed with caution as the side effects can vary in intensity from person to person.	1	April 3, 2021	3
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I have been prescribed Amphetamine Salt Combo which has worked well(I have ADD and narcolepsy). Today I was given from RX, Amphetamine Aspertate, it make me fell kinda sickness. Was I given the wrong medicine. The prescription has not changed ?	7	April 1, 2021	3
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I’ve been on Adderrall immediate release for at least 8 years, probably more. At first Adderrall gave me an intense high and made me very talkative. Very talkative. That lasted for a few days and after that each morning when I took it it gave me a euphoric feeling for about have the day. I wasn’t making impulsive decisions like I had in the past and my focus was razor sharp. I really enjoyed this drug for sometime but the last 3-5 years it’s just been the same old same old. I take it in the morning and have somewhat of a boost in energy and focus but after around 11am the effects of the medication just wears off. I wind up feeling irritable, decent level of focus if I’m busy at work, and just downright not very social with people. This week I’m going to see my P.A. and hopefully get on Vyvanse which I was encouraged by many to try before jumping on Adderrall. Vyvanse is more expensive but I’m ready to feel more focused and more myself.	5	March 28, 2021	4
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	This review is for generic Adderall XR - amphetamine/dextroamphetamine. I've experienced wildly different effects from different manufacturers. Some days it didn't work. Some days it worked great. But I got severe debilitating headaches that lasted 24/7 and didn't go away using ibuprofen. Went to neurologist and got an MRI. If I could push past the side effects it did work well but for only about 4-5 hours after kicking in (which took about an hour). Needed a booster of IR in the afternoon, so eventually I couldn't deal with the headaches and switched to IR completely. Headaches gone almost immediately. I still get them with IR but not anywhere near as often or as bad.	6	March 23, 2021	1
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Mydayis (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	"I've tried several ADHD meds and Mydayis has definitely been the best for me. I'm on the lowest dose and it starts working 20-30 minutes after I take it. I'm then able to be productive and direct my focus easily, compared to other meds (eg-Adderall) which gave me a burst of intense focus that I had no control over. The transitions are barely noticeable and it really helps maintain consistent energy levels. After wearing off, it's a very natural ""I've worked all day and now I'm ready to relax before bed"" feeling (no crash). I also noticed it significantly helps manage my depression-something no other ADHD med has done. The only downsides: (1) it does reduce my appetite a lot and (2) it only lasts about 9-10 hours on my current dose (12.5mg), but higher doses (25mg+) give me headaches. It's not perfect, but the positives definitely outweigh the negatives for me. Lastly-you don't know how it'll affect you, so don't let reviews scare you away if you/your doc think it might help."	9	March 21, 2021	4
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I was diagnosed with ADHD at age 17 and only really started taking stimulant medication after I had turned 20 last year. I was originally trying out varying doses of IR but started trying XR in the past few months.  Overall: Hit or miss for me. It does help with my focus, but the side effects and how much it helps varies pretty drastically depending on the day. Biggest side effects are dehydration, lack of appetite, potentially crashing at night (normal). I also feel a bit uncomfortable sometimes (anxiety-ish twitchy feeling) but that's not very common.  The mallinckrodt brand I was switched to recently seems maybe a bit more hit or miss honestly I can't really tell that much of a difference (unlike people on opioids who swear that mallinckrodt is awful). I'm on 25mg for now and I'm gonna keep seeing how I feel in the coming weeks. Helps with ADHD no doubt, but do be weary of the side effects.	7	March 16, 2021	2
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Mydayis (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I took Mydayis 37.5 mg for 2 years. I just recently ran out and decided to wait a week to refill. I cannot believe the change in myself! While on it I became withdrawn and too focused on 1 specific thing. I cut out people and ruined my small business. I didn't feel human! I can't explain the feeling but now that I haven't taken it in a week I feel like myself again! I was just flesh living day by day on mydayis! I will NEVER touch it again! Please tell me there's others out there with similar experiences	1	March 12, 2021	5
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	"I have been taking teva 20mg adderall from 06-19 when they disappeared. I had already suffered from side effects from other generics due to CVS giving me a different generic a few times without consent or being informed. I did the whole google wormhole for a few months before finally seeing a random comment about ""INACTIVE"" ingredients and how this person suffered terrible side effects across multiple generic medications with this same ""INACTIVE"" ingredient. Being on multiple meds myself and having autoimmune and neuro disorders it affected my mental health knowing something wasn't right and just not grasping why & not understanding. That random comment changed everything for me ""INACTIVE"" does not equal no effect.  Teva not being an option then and now not at all I use Mallinckrodt and Arubindo 20 mg. I find it helps to switch them every couple months or I take M in the morning and A in the afternoon depending on how my body is functioning. I tried SAndoz that was terrible side effects."	8	March 6, 2021	2
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Narcolepsy	I've been on adderall 20 mg 3× a day for over 10 years from secondary narcolepsy due to a TBI. I will only take Teva there plenty of generics that don't work and are less than a 10% out of 100% I got these I think Mallinckrodt U30 on it I tried returning it after taking 3 and falling asleep they wouldn't return so I took about 7 more just to get home from the pharmacy 1hour drive without passing out it did nothing. If I took 4 Teva I'd bounce off the walls won't sleep for at least 1 day. I will never again take anything besides the Teva after sleeping for the remainder of the month. I wish I could afford the brand name. Don't listen to any pharmacist generic aren't close I can't believe they get away with saying there same as brand lol body doesn't lie.

ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	My 7 year old son is a first grader and was recently diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. He has been recommended Adderall for this but I am a bit reluctant to initiate its usage. I have a few reservations about how long it lasts in our system which I have heard can prove to be dangerous for a young kid. I have read multiple articles like these, but I am still not so sure. Seeing the number of experienced people here, please tell me if I should continue with it.		March 4, 2021	4
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	First time taking Alvogen generic amphetamine with dextroamphetamine 30mg. Been taking adderall for 2 years but always Teva generic. Oh my God, the Alvogen brand has made me feel so sick. All over severe headache, nauseous, vomiting, diarrhea. I feel awful. No focus, no energy, can't keep anything down, running to the bathroom.	1	February 27, 2021	8
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Been taking adderall for years. Until the had me try a white stop sign shaped one by mallinckrodt since there was an adderall shortage at my Walgreens. mallinckrodt amphetamine/dextroamphetamine shouldn’t even be labeled as amphetamine/dextroamphetamine it should just be sold as a caffeine pill because all it does is wake you up subtlety. It doesn’t help with focus whatsoever. I’ve already filed a complaint with the FDA and recommend everyone else do the same	1	February 25, 2021	20
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I take the 10 mg amphetamine with dextroamphetamine by Teva and it works great, better than the 15 mg.in my opinion. I see others mentioning generics by Alogen and Mallinckrodt here. Well I take a couple of other medications manufactured by these 2, on and off, most times it's Mallickrodt. Let me tell you, this is the WORST drug manufacturer on the market. The Alogen is junk too. I've been on a few medical chat sites just to see what I can find out about Mallinckrodt and see if others felt the same way and they absolutely do! Literally 100's of people have complained to the co. itself and to the FDA. This has been going on for a solid 5 years at least & the stuff is STILL pure unadulterated JUNK.	7	February 21, 2021	23
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Mydayis (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Switched from Concerta to Mydayis for the longer duration mechanism Mydayis offers. Was started on 25mg of Mydayis. ADD symptoms improved but I experienced dry mouth, dizziness, heart increase, and appetite decrease which subsided after the first week. Second week I felt like the dose was not effective. Doc switched me to 37.5mg of the mydayis and so far symptoms of ADD improved but side effects are rough. Dry mouth, headache, dizziness, lack of appetite, increased anxiety. I’m on day 4 or 5 so hoping the side effects subside when my body adjusts to the higher dose... fingers crossed.	6	February 20, 2021	4
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I am currently on Adderall XR 30MG, and it has changed so many different aspects of my life, including depression.  I was prescribed Adderall because I was about to be terminated from my job. Back to the drug, I take it around 6am everyday, and found that my overall mood has changed. I am not as emotional as I was before, yet I am still able to express my feelings when necessary without the full breakdowns. I have been dealing with Major Depressive Disorder, and this medication has alleviated most of those feelings.  However, the medication has not been a miracle drug, and it contains no magic! For me, ADD has always been there. For me, it took me to be 36 years old to finally realize it was time to visit a psychiatrist, regardless of all the negative stigmas; I was glad I did, because it gave me many suspected answers, rather than self diagnosing situations.	9	February 15, 2021	17
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’ve taken adderall for years. I used to be on Lannett brand and Walgreens recently switched to TEVA. I had my script switched from CVS to Walgreens because it was closer to me. I have been on it for 3 months and the side effects are TERRIBLE.  I clench my teeth so bad my teeth have broken, I am severely depressed, I can’t find happiness in literally anything. I don’t feel motivated at all. If anything I feel less motivated to get out of bed. My skin is dry, my eyes are sinking in and I get terrible migraines. My anxiety is so bad I’m anti social, and I thought I had a stroke because of side effects. I’m 25. Just don’t take it		February 13, 2021	7
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I take two 30 mg pills a day for ADHD and it has really made a huge difference in my life. I am able to focus on one task at a time and complete it. Works great for giving me the motivation I sometimes lack. Only issue is that when I was given the white or peach ones, they did not seem to work as well as the pink ones. Talked to doctor about it and she added to my prescription to only receive the pink ones. Curious if anyone else has had this issue	9	February 10, 2021	34
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	ALVOGEN INC has got me all messed up. I've taken ADHD meds since 1st grade and I'm 32 now so I'm very confident in my ability to distinguish between generics that work & don't and why. For the past 4 years I've used the same CVS location to fill my Adderall tab 30mg generic the past two times though I received a pill that looked different thinking okay whatever this happens from time to time it is just a different manufacturer no big deal. I was wrong. I have had insanely high blood pressure increases, trouble sleeping, hardly any focus, SEVERE anxiety like where is feel like I can't breathe suddenly especially when I try to sleep, shaky hands, VERY noticeable heart palpitations, diarrhea, headaches and  weird emotional ups & downs. I've been vegan for 3 months now at first I was seeing a steady decrease in blood pressure but as soon as I started taking this new generic I'm topping out at 161/111 at the doctor a few days ago which is just absolutely bonkers and terrifying	2	February 9, 2021	9
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’ve taken TEVA adderall 20 mg IR for the past 2+ years. It worked greatly for my ADD & as an anti-depressant. HOWEVER, it has changed! Starting July 2020, the TEVA tablet was completely different. It was no longer sweet, the consistency was harder & the efficacy was compromised. I can take it & fall asleep hours later & there is ZERO anti-depressant effect. In fact, it deepens my depression.  I will submit a report to the FDA & I encourage everyone else to. Also, please research the complaints of TEVAs other generics. I’m not sure what to try next. I tried the Sandoz and it was actually worse. I received the hideous Zydus once-which gave me a migraine & intensely aching back.I believe it’s manufactured out of this country.  This experience has made me question ALL generic medications.   Please start researching yours & refuse to take these.  I tried switching to name brands but my ins. refuses to pay.	2	February 8, 2021	11
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Have used a generic for about 6 years now worked for me except it has turned me into a teeth grinder I do it all the time and now my teeth are worn to the point they are ruined.  My doctor said he never heard of that side effect but a recent visit to a dentist to try to fix my teeth I was told they see this all the time and this grinding may never go away. I need to find something that works without these side effects	6	February 4, 2021	9
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine)	My cardiologist who diagnosed me with dysautonomia prescribed me adderall in high school because my symptoms included extreme fatigue, brain fog, and *bad* orthostatic hypotension. He did not warn me about all the side effects I would experience (due partly to the fact that I do not have ADHD), and I was given a high dose to start. It did help with my fatigue and immensely improved my focus (can’t complain there, I was *hyper* focused), brain fog, and hypotension, but there were some questionable side effects I experienced for the almost 2 years I took it: complete lack of appetite, significant weight loss, resting tachycardia and angina (my dysautonomia makes my HR very high to begin with) Overall it definitely improved my quality of life for a time but it seems like a questionable Rx for people with this condition who are hyper adrenal, already experiencing an overactive sympathetic ANS, and have a high HR due to the cardio effects.	7	January 27, 2021	3
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I’ve been in this medication for almost a year . And it change my life in good way. Made me focus on my goals and I want to achieve and increased my motivation to become better person also balance my mood and decreased my depression.	9	January 19, 2021	14
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been taking Teva amphetamine/dextroamphetamine (adderall generic) for quite sometime for ADHD. In the last year, I noticed right away something was off. First was the obvious color. The Teva that has always worked for me with no problems (that was being weaned out in 2019) was as follows..  peach color and sweet, easy to swallow and not gag on. Teva now, is orange. The sweet taste that made it bearable to take has changed completely. My focus, clarity, motivation, and concentration has been/is immensely effected by the new ingredient change. (I don't have it at all)  My overall mental health, has declined quickly. It has caused my mood to completely change, headaches are constant, and upset stomach. All of this, and they don't even work. I struggle everyday now. Less main ingredient and more fillers means more pills can be produced, which means more money in the manufacturer's pocket..... Mental health should be top priority, especially being consistent with and not changing the ingredients.	1	January 17, 2021	50
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	This month is the first time I received sandoz adderall ER and it doesn't seem to work very well for me. Mallinckrodt doesn't seem to work too well for me either. I think Teva seems to work the best for me; even better than the name brand for adderall.	6	January 17, 2021	2
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I have suffered with ADHD since I was a young kid, I got diagnosed at the youngest age possible and I never got any help for it by my old doctor.  With my new doctor, he gave me Adderall XR to start out with 10 and than up it to 20 within a week if not effective.   I am on 20 MG now and it has changed my life, I failed school and life because I couldn't pay attention and now not only can I pay attention but this has also helped as my ADHD had caused Depression/Anxiety also OCD.	10	January 15, 2021	14
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Generic Adderall varies significantly depending on mfg. Reason being, the FDA says the mfg only has to “demonstrate” it “works in the same way “ as the brand-name. i.e. generic ingredients do  Not have to be same which is why so many don’t work and/or make people feel sick. My experience, the only generic that works like the brand-name is Prasco, which acquired Teva’s generic xr in 2016.  Few pharmacies use Prasco as their generic because it’s more expensive!  My Dr specifies “Prasco generic only” on my prescription for D-Amphetamine ER 30MG Salt combo. By law, the pharmacy must comply if Prasco is one of their overall suppliers. My insurance changed so I called Prasco to see if they sell to Costco. They do. Just takes a day or 2 for the pharmacist to order and fill my script. Walgreens used Prasco as their generic until recently. Now it’s Mallinckrodt which just filed for bankruptcy to settle a slew of opioid lawsuits. It’s all about $		January 8, 2021	59
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	The adderall name brand is 2-3 times better than generic adderall XR. The FDA should be inspecting these generic companies and make sure they are getting as high of quality ingredients. I urge anyone in generics to try real adderall for a month then decided for yourself. Decide to report the generics because we should be able to get a cheaper still 90$ for generic compared to $220+ for name brand.	10	January 7, 2021	18
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’m a doctor with ADHD. I’ve been on the generics to cut costs during tough times but I insist on the name brand adderall. No only is it smoother it lasts longer and helps even more than the generics. It’s a shame that cost is a bearing on necessary prescriptions and that generic are so much weaker and poorer quality. Generic adderall needs to step it up they have quality issues and their recipe is somehow flawed.	5	January 7, 2021	25
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for Narcolepsy	I was diagnosed with a severe case of narcolepsy about a year ago. I always thought it was my chronic fatigue that made me feel so sleepy all the time. I was finally referred to a sleep specialist who ordered a night and day time sleep study. When I received the results he told me I was a very sleepy person, his worst case in many years. I have been taking 20MG Adderall 3x a day. It does help but I'm still extremely tired throughout the day. The sleep doctor advised me in September that there's a newer medication that can be added to my Adderall but insurance didn't like to approve it and that in 6 months hopefully it will be easier to prescribe. I've seen somewhere that 60MG a day is the max for treating ADHD but that 90MG is the max for treating narcolepsy. I'm curious if that dose would improve my symptoms. Overall I'm happy with the medication as I never notice any side effects. I just want to feel more awake and less sleepy.	7	January 6, 2021	9
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)		Alvo Adderall sucks. It doesn’t work at all. I'm so annoyed that  my month will suck while taking this brand	1	January 4, 2021	4
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Mydayis (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I've only been taking it for 3 days but I can understand now when people say they feel it running in the background. So far no side effects other than appetite loss. I do feel energy from this but not like Adderall there's no anxiety tied to the energy its more like motivation than energy. One thing I've noticed is I like to always be doing something that is productive in some way. It's not the type of energy you get and use to dance or workout you feel driven to get things done.  It last for the whole 16 hours which surprised me I'm an ultra rapid metabolizer. I have no crash on this like I did with Adderall. I'm just waiting for my period now to see how the cramps are and giving the medicine more time to see if I do have any side effects, so far none but no appetite.	10	January 3, 2021	11
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I've been taking dextroamp-amphet ER 15mg once a day for roughly 3 months now and it's helped me greatly until 2 weeks ago and it's as if I cut my dose by 3/4! Is this normal and what dose, frequency, and type of adderall should I change to? I've heard about generic vs name brand, so what do the best ones look like?	6	December 30, 2020	1
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I've been prescribed adderall for 10yrs+ and without it mentally and physically I would be worse. I do have soreness, achy body, etc but have other health problems. Adderall has ROTTED MY TEETH OUT. Being 42 years old, fear ability to retain with out medicine as I age. I have severe withdrawal, to include extreme fatigue, severe constipation. I need the Adderral and helps some as without it life would be more difficult. All and all I would not manage without it very well but it is less effective as been taking for years. Take care and God Bless All. Be Safe!	7	December 24, 2020	10
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Narcolepsy	I take the regular Adderall 20mg in the morning, but do 10mg in the afternoon; along with my other prescribed stimulants since mornings are the hardest for me. I got a new prescription and after a couple days of feeling like complete rubbish and having unscheduled naps each day, I noticed it was different.   After having the name brand and suddenly switching to this generic; it made sense why I suddenly felt like I could never wake up, even on 480mg of stimulants each day. Even as I write this at almost 11pm, I have felt like I can't do anything but lay down and nod off throughout the day.  These generics are different and affect our quality of life. When your treatment works and suddenly you feel like you aren't even taking your medicine because of a sudden switch to a placebo-like generic is a huge problem.  Where is the consistency for these medications!?	1	November 30, 2020	25
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for Narcolepsy	Adderall worked well for a year then it wore off even with medication free holidays. When trying a new medication and stopping I didn’t realize how out of breath it was making me, I thought it was because I was fat.	3	November 25, 2020	7
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Fatigue	I just tried Alvogen brand of amphetamine/dextroamphetamine this month because my pharmacy. It is absolutely awful. I feel like my body is screaming, absolutely doesn’t help with energy or attention. Just increases anxiety. And I’m extremely lethargic. I strongly recommend against them.	1	November 25, 2020	27
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Regarding the post by DrKatz on 11/7/2020:.  I too take the 20 mg salt combo- manufactured by Teva, and have been on that specific brand for two and a half years.  I can definitely concur that something has changed with their product.   I am on a prescription of 80 mg a day and I too noticed a difference in taste, consistency of the pill itself, and it not working as well as it used to.  I am aware of a recall May 22nd by Teva for a few of their doses- the 20mg pill being one of them.   Thinking placebo, I inspected the pill closely: the depression level of the imprint is different, slight change in the oblong shape, the edging* (*like the cut/side profile of floor boards) and thickness + curvature.   The taste difference (bitter) I noticed in August. October back to normal but currently (Nov.) the taste changed again- however this time with a much greater chemical profile- like bactine or rubbing alcohol, more crumbly and not working as well for either my ADHD or narcolepsy.	8	November 15, 2020	29
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I’ve been on Adderall XR 20 mg since October 6th 2020. I have to say this medication is life changing and your psychiatrist, doctor or whatever will try and find the right dosage for you. I’m 22 years old, Male and I noticed the medication working within an hour, I’m about 220 pounds 5’8 and despite that it still kicked in relatively fast. The side affects I notice the most are as follows dry mouth, appetite suppression, some irritability, and insomnia on occasion. Adderall XR for me last anywhere from 8-12 hours, if it wears off the medical professional in most cases will add Adderall IR to take in the afternoon, since upping the dose of XR will not increase duration only the intensity of the medication itself. ADHD medication is all about finding what’s right for YOU, don’t give up if it doesn’t get manageable or fixed after the first try.	9	November 8, 2020	41
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have always used Teva Adderall IR because I have had horrible experiences with other generic, including inconsistency and lack of potency.  Understand that I have taken Teva Adderall 20MG tablets over five years, thus it would less difficult for someone like me to detect subtle changes in its effects.  I have noticed the following, and this started around September 2020.  Teva generic Adderall tablets seem (and this is very subtle) smaller in size. Second: Teva is known for its slight sweet taste. It is almost as if that is completely  gone... I’m certainly not saying that added anything to it, but I’m saying it’s an indicator  of some sort of formula change.  Finally, although the 20MG tablet is small, it used to be easy to half the tablet. Recently they just crumble. To summarize, I have also noted a very marked decrease in efficacy.	7	November 7, 2020	26
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Adderall XR is Life changing (positively). I went from being massively distractable and procrastinate constantly to getting things done. I'm not just referring to school work or office work. I mean just showing up on time to meet up with friends. Not getting instantly bored with family.  I truly love it!   --- Quick warning, take it as your doctor recommends! So much of the bad press comes from people abusing the drug.  Likewise, if you're able, take a day off now and then. Perhaps on days when you don't need to work or do much. It's sort of like coffee/tea/caffeine in that sense. Fine if you do take it everyday, but probably best if you give your mind/body a rest from it now & then.  Just like running or exercise, you need light or rest days each week to really get the most from the workout.	10	November 6, 2020	33
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	My grades instantly went from the 60s and 70s to 90s and 100s and for once I felt like I had control over my life. The side effects were pretty bad and inconsistent though, so I had to go from 20 to 15 mg.	9	November 4, 2020	18
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine)	My son had been on every ADHD meds made by mankind since he was 5. He is 17 now, and because I go read reviews after the doctor changes his meds. I thought it might help someone who has went through all of them also. Adderall was the worst . My son was happy, enteric, easy go lucky and even on daytrana.  Ritalin, foculian, etc. he never lost himself. On adderall he was drowning mentally. Depression set in, moodiness, anger, punching walls, so mad he would black out, etc. Be very careful !!!!! Do not choose this one if you but all help it!	1	October 26, 2020	9
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	The Adderal dose my doctor prescribed didn't seem to work that great(20 mg twice a day)  One day I had it after my oatmeal and it was more effective so after that I just scrunched up the pill like I did with oatmeal, but I didn't put it on anything.  I just took it like that. Works great!  Much more motivation to get tasks done so I can finish more!  Maybe you could try that if it sees not enough to work.  I use Sandoz.	10	October 11, 2020	20
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for Narcolepsy	I was switched to Adderall but after 2 years switched to Ritalin. Adderall seems to open up parts of your brain best left closed. I started to see a 12 year old boy in the yard during the day he would be gone when I went to talk with him. My neighbors told me that in the 1970s he died here. You have to watch the dosage	10	October 10, 2020	26
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for Narcolepsy	I have been soooo sleepy for the past 15 years of my life. I finally found a PA that listened to me about my sleepiness. She has been great. I can not afford the recommended sleep study. I am currently taking 10mg extended release. It has helped but I am still falling asleep at work. My PA will meet with me in after a month on it. I’m not sure if I need an increased dosage or if it’s not working on me. It’s a struggle still. I don’t want to feel hopeless that I can’t find help.	6	October 9, 2020	11
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Adderall XR was originally prescribed to me for ADD, but it worked best as a terrific antidepressant.  However, now that I've been on it for 20 straight years at 40-80 mg. Daily, it has very little antidepressant effect now. It's Adderall burnout -- apparently it strips the brain of dopamine -- the feel-good hormone.        I still have to take it just to do anything at all each day.  The worst effect is insomnia -- no matter how early I take it.  It keeps me up for 24 hours unless I finally have to take Seroquel for sleep.  Seroquel is the only thing that will knock out Adderall XR.  But I hate it because it makes me so damn sluggish in the morning, awful.        I cannot believe it's 2020, and there is still no decent antidep medication available,	8	October 1, 2020	31
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	The last 9 months generic “Zydus” was the only brand of amphetamine/dextroamphetamine available in my area. I noticed pretty nasty side effects beginning 45 minutes after consumption. I’ve never felt depression so severely before taking Zydus. Teva/Barr has returned. Felt a night and day difference the first day. Hope Zydus gets banned for the safety of us all.	1	September 23, 2020	20
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Stressed and depressed and always angry.	7	September 21, 2020	23
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Mydayis (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I switched over to Mydayis in hope of finding something that could last the entire day. My days are usually nonstop for approx 16 hours. I started at the lowest dose and went up to the 50mg after 3 weeks. Gave it a few more weeks in hopes that it would work like how we wanted it to. The negative side effects outweigh the positives. The first thing I noticed was ejaculatory anhedonia. It led to an unplanned pregnancy before I caught it. The rest included falling behind in classes and not being able to keep up at work. Felt lazy and not wanting to do anything. It was like being unmedicated all over again!	4	September 21, 2020	8
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine)	I am so confused but feeling better just knowing I am not alone. I am very sensitive to any changes in medication. I have been on 10 mg twice daily for about 10 months. The pharmacy has switched generic brands multiple times. I did well on one made by Sun Industries but am not doing well on Teva. Apparently they make the name brand which I didn’t know until tonight. I would also like to know how we can change the way generics are approved. The variations are laughable and can really cause problems. I’m hesitant to switch to a different generic because what always happens is they stop making it or the pharmacy can’t get it. I requested name brand so at least it’s consistent. Any suggestions? So frustrated! Best to you all.	7	September 21, 2020	41
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for Narcolepsy	This medicine is god send. I have been suffering with narcolepsy for about 5 years. Had no idea what I was doing wrong that I cannot keep my eye open. I am talking about sleeping for 8-9 hours and then waking up and wanting to go back to sleep. I am a public school teacher and I had no choice but to be at work all day. That was a struggle and I was embarrassed to even tell my coworkers. This summer, so many unpleasant events happened in my life, I decided to talk to my psychiatrist about unable to concentrate and the excessive sleeping pattern. He wanted me to try adderall and bam!! I haven’t taken a nap since August . I do not have any side effects, not glittery, no overworking , nothing. Just ready to start the day and get in with my life. I usually go to bed around 9:30pm and sleeps well. I take 20 mg twice a day. But if you miss a dose, back to square one. I am religiously on a schedule and take them at the same time everyday. I am in my mid 40’s.	10	September 17, 2020	38
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Generic Adderall:  TEVA vs. ALVOGEN “All generic adderall is NOT the same trust me!...... I don’t care what your physician or pharmacist may say.“  I’ve taken Adderall for nearly 25 plus years for ADD.  WHY? it works twice as good ask anyone whose taken different brands before. For the BEST quality and most potent adderall on the market is made by a company called TEVA.  Even pharmacist tell me when they run out of TEVA and must use ALVOGEN their patients complain because the pharmacies cannot keep TEVA in stock because the consumers know it’s the best and most effective for ADD and ADHD.	1	September 15, 2020	131
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have taken both Adderall and its generic(amphetamine/dextroamphetamine) for over 16 years for my Adult Attention Deficit Disorder. I have found that the original Adderall has the best effectiveness and in these last 4 tears Teva [still oval, peach/orange color] working the best for my A.D.D. Pills made by Mallinkrodt I only get by mistake, and still act like a placebo in May 2020. Dose: 20mg. X 2 daily.		August 25, 2020	24
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I do not like this formula. I have been on various generics for years and did not feel like this 10 mg did anything. Unfortunately, I've already filled this prescription and am stuck with this medication.	1	August 24, 2020	7
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been taking Adderall for most of my adult life and Walgreens always carried the generic version that worked best for me but recently they changed who they get it from now and the new amphetamine / dextroamphetamine from Lannett MFG SUCK!  They do not work at all - actually the worst next to the  YELLOW ROUND Mp 447's, PINK ROUND Cor 136's, or OCTAGON WHITE ONES.   The TEVA amphetamine/dextroamphetamine Peach Oval B 974's are the ones that work best for me and now I don' t know how to get them - Help..	10	June 16, 2020	93
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	My concern in taking generic Adderall IR for several years is the effect is has on my heart  When I take it, at the prescribed dose,  I most always have sinus tachycardia  (a heart rate above 100 beats per minute)  I also have noticed that it effects bladder emptying....and my urinary stream seems slower (and I am fairly young) and I am not usually able to completely empty my bladder.	6	June 10, 2020	26
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Since the shortage for about 3 months I've been taking generic Zydus 20mg. How do these drugs pass inspection? I think a couple pixie sticks would work better. I wonder if generic adderall from any manufacturer will ever get better. I think charging over $5.00 for this rubbish should be criminal.	1	June 7, 2020	40
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	This medication amphetamine/dextroamphetamine has made me feel VERY JITTERY and sick to my stomach! I take generic TEVA brand orange tab 30 mg. The pharmacy didn’t have any of the TEVA brand so they gave me generic U31 tablet - Aurolife Pharma, LLC brand. This is horrible! People take time off work to be seen by doctor, get put on meds for a reason, spend money for the appointment and meds, all the time you spend doing this & it can’t be returned back to Walmart to get my right medicine because “it’s against the law” supposedly! Even when I have the entire prescription (minus one) to give them back. Why make people feel like this when they do so much to try and make life easier being on their meds. I don’t have insurance so my doc visit is almost $100 & medicine is around $60 every month. My 7 year old daughters meds were switched as well. I’m scared to even give her medicine! How can Walmart just give you a different brand that you’ve never taken and not tell me before I leave it’s different!?	1	June 5, 2020	67
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Fatigue	I have been through about all anti-depressants, mood stabilizers, and anti-psychotics for my severe treatment-resistant depression and this medicineamphetamine/dextroamphetamine has saved me. Honestly, I have horrible anxiety as well. I have Chronic PTSD and Generalized Anxiety Disorder. This medicine calms my nerves as well. I can actually take naps during the day now when I need to instead of not being able to rest. It helps my impulsiveness from my Bipolar Disorder that is included in my Schizoaffective diagnosis. I may have to deal with the hallucinations but this medicine is the only medicine that works for me in the most positive way. For me, it has way less severe side effects than any medicine I have tried. It mainly helps with my energy levels which helps my depression because I feel more useful I also am more social which helps my confidence. The only thing I struggle with is the lack of appetite and it seems like water goes right through me. But, It is definitely a life saver for me. <3	10	May 3, 2020	32
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I am a male in my thirties. Adderall is the third drug I tried to tread ADHD after doing trials on Vyvanse and Concerta. Vyvanse worked but did not last long enough and I had bad crashing (headache, exhaustion). Concerta did not work for me at all, made me lethargic and even more distracted.  Adderall at 20mg a day gives me energy to focus on work and my kids. It lasts me until sometime in the evening. I have trouble sleeping some nights on it, other than that the side effects are negligible.	8	May 3, 2020	43
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Activist Dextramp-amphet ER (30 mg.) [ generic for Adderall ]  is HORRIBLE. NOT effective.

ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for Narcolepsy	Generic Adderall is not the same. I feel immediately awful when I realize they switched me to generic dextro amp (amp salts works not sure what brand. I heard Teva might have moved distribution centres and have been alternating approved cheaper alternative ingredients. Well guess what they don’t work AT ALL. Check the generic brands when you get your script filled and see how you feel. The old generic brand I took worked just fine. I cannot get out of bed for weeks because whatever “similar” generic cheap alternatives they are using do not make the cut. Welcome back debilitating fatigue!	6	April 12, 2020	129
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Adderall is very useful but recently I was ignorant and thought it would be okay to take a little extra at night to help clean my house. I took a bigger extra dose then I should have and a few hours later I felt pretty awful. I am very productive and more positive on the right dose of this med, so I recommend trying it or Desoxyn, because it is said to have fewer side effects like anxiety and panic and irritability post dose. Like all meds, Adderall is a blessing when dosed right and a curse when dosed incorrectly. I noticed that I paced around a bit when on it but I didn’t feel that anxious. It isn’t fun and enjoyable to take a big dose, don’t do it. God made everything to be used in moderation and it is much better for the whole society when we obey the wise instructions of our doctors and leaders. Be careful, obey your doctor, and may God bless you all to succeed in your treatment plans and in your lives. Amen	8	March 18, 2020	74
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	These batches have to improve. I can't even focus on anything and have narcolepsy.	1	March 10, 2020	35
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Recently changed pharmacies and didn't realize that there can be quite a difference between generics. For 4 years I’ve taken adderall 2x day, 10 mg. Never any problems until I switched pharmacies to save $.  Elite Pharma is who makes this new one and it is NOT GOOD.   I am lethargic, unable to focus, quite sleepy.  It’s as if I haven’t even taken anything.  Incredibly frustrating as I am not even half way through this months supply.	1	March 7, 2020	50
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	The generic manufacturer of amphetamine & dextroamphetamine, Sandoz, is the only one that works for me. This month the manufacturer is Northstar and last month Aurobindo, and they are garbage. They don’t help AT ALL with my focus. Zero.  I am irritable. I am getting nothing done and my anxiety is sky high. I am going to stop taking these brands and ask pharmacy for Sandoz.  I complained to the FDA and urge others to do so as well. This is ridiculous.	1	March 3, 2020	70
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Adderall has worked great for me when taken as needed. When I was in my early 20’s and taking it daily I built up a dependence that lead to terrible withdrawals as it is very addictive. (Learned the hard way and never want to go through that again!)  I will usually only take this when my ADHD symptoms are unbearable and my work/personal life starts to become affected. We are talking maybe 1-4 tablets max per month.  It really does help with focus and energy, and I find that one 10-20mg dose is usually enough and I feel good for several days after the dose without any withdrawals or dependence issues.

ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Laura, CVS in Kansas City and probably elsewhere exclusively carry SANDOZ. With goodrx my 60 tablets of 20mg are 28$	9	February 22, 2020	32
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	If you're taking for ADHD please note there are a lot of side effects, having said this, they are sometimes serious so take note to talk to your doctor. If you get cold fingers or toes, make sure to consult your doctor as it's a syndrome that can be prevented.  It does help with focus, it helps with impulse control, it helps with a general overall euphoric feeling and it can cause you to lose a lot of weight. Be sure to eat, EAT, don't shake your head, you know I'm talking to you. Eat and stay hydrated it causes you to urinate a LOT, make sure to supplement what you are losing. It will cause tremors, shakes, and irritability, again, eat food. Make sure to stick to a 2000 calorie diet AT LEAST. May cause muscle fatigue and extreme soreness, stay hydrated, make sure of this.  Some say it causes better grades in school, well, to an extent. It just makes you write a lot. Eat Eat Hydrate And maybe take melatonin to help promote rest. I warned and entertained you.	7	February 21, 2020	97
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	My daughter developed tardive dyskinesia, a permanent drug-induced movement disorder, while on Adderall. If your kid has ODD, stay away from all stimulates; they are most at-risk.	1	February 19, 2020	26
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I totally agree that the new A 79 generics are no good.  I mean they work a little bit, but I feel taking the same amount of the other oblong orange ones that taste like sweet we’re way better.  These taste like nasty chalk.    I’ve never had adderal brand though so I wouldn’t that difference.	3	February 19, 2020	25
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I have been on  adderal 15mg 2×daily  for 7 yrs it has completely change my life.  I  was always down, depressed, unmotivated, impulsive, always day dreaming, short attention span, no focus and couldn't sitting still. Adderal has given me a new happy life that I can enjoy and appreciate. Starting to think I need to go up to 20mg. I can feel I'm getting used to them. But without them I wouldn't get out of bed and would waste my life.I  think adderal is my miracle drug I have never been so grateful for a prescription drug	10	February 17, 2020	111
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I was diagnosed with ADHD combined type and have tried Ritalin and Focalin. Both weren't that great for me so my doctor prescribed me 10 mg of Adderall XR. Adderall has made me have better multitasking skills and helped me pay attention. It hasn't really helped with being hyper or being impulsive and has given me bad twitching eyes. It also has made my sleep schedule weird so watch out for that.	6	February 6, 2020	23
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Picked up amphetamine with dextroamphetamine medicine 1/24/20, bottle said Barr brand? But Teva tabs were inside. Teva bought Barr in 07. Before Teva bought out multiple companies and started using their ingredients within the last 2-3 years, they were great. Sandoz and Corepharma have been the only other decent makers, before they were bought out. I haven’t noticed a thing from picking these up 1/24. The worst medicine I’ve had from Teva in 8 years.	1	February 4, 2020	36
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	On 1/24/2020 I received Teva generic IR Adderall like I usually have for the last 7 years off and on (used to be good.) Except Barr was labeled on the bottle for the first time ever. Not sure why since Teva bought Barr in 07. Regardless it isn’t any better, by far the worst I’ve had of Teva. But every other company is pathetic. Brand works 10X better but 10X pricier. If the FDA enforced the rule of not less than 80% and no more than 125% concentrated effectiveness, that would be a first! The right MG of each dose might be regulated, but the fillers/inactive ingredients added is the big issue. 1-3 used to be in the old Barr/ Shire/ Sandoz/ Core and those worked fantastic. Every generic now has 5-8 fillers that make it less effective but also cause severe side effects. FDA could care less about small market drugs.	1	February 3, 2020	50
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Game changer. First DX by A pdoc: ADHD. What, no?  Yes.  I felt like I was only working with one puzzle piece and finding out about ADHD was like being given the other 999 pieces. At first Adderall IR didn’t seem to do much but I slowly realized it was like putting emotional and mental blinders on where I could see the rest of the world but mainly focus on the task at hand. Job saver for sure.  Since I have a high tolerance to meds XR saved me from constantly trying to remember to take next dose when I started crashing. Tops.	10	February 3, 2020	30
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I have found the generic brand for Adderall is not effective as the brand name. The Epic brand caused me to have severe depression, blurred vision, headaches, very tired and no focus at all.  I’m trying to find a brand that is much like the name brand. Looking for suggestions if anyone can share please. Thanks	1	January 29, 2020	95
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I went to pharmacy to pick up my Adderall generic brand Zydus. I was told they was out of my brand. I was given the Epic brand. The Epic brand caused me to have severe depression and I stayed in bed, I’ve always been very energetic. I stopped taking it. I called the Pharmacist and reported the side effects I had. Pharmacist didn’t act surprised at all, stated we are out of your regular brand and probably won’t get it back in.	1	January 28, 2020	18
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Generics make me feel ill, sometimes headache, sometimes itching or hives.  Google where generics are made.	1	January 24, 2020	45
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	"I was so glad to see these posts.  Pharmacies are so rude to me. I switched to so many brands, but they say they are all alike, and say it doesn't matter which generic I get, because they're all the same.  My doctor, unfortunately, thinks the same.  I finally said to the pharmacy tech one day, ""I'm sure I'm not the only one, who would like certain generics."" She said, no, I'm the only one. I know this sounds crazy, but the blue 10mg of teva, don't seem to work like the 15mg of the peach teva, even if I cut one of the blue in half to make it 15mg."	8	January 23, 2020	90
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I was taking 15mg of generic Adderall  amphetamine / dextroamphetamine  for 3 months and by the end of the 3rd month I had 3 separate people tell me I didn't seem myself. I'm a regularly joyful and excited person but every emotion I had felt muted or stunted while on amphetamine/dextroamphetamine. I stopped talking it and 3 days later felt so much better. I was joyful again! Back to pinging all over the place but at least I'm happy doing it lol. I'm trying Concerta next.	4	January 21, 2020	3
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Ok so I have Both Narcolepsy/Extreme Fatigue & ADD. The generic forms of Adderall (amphetamine and dextroamphetamine) seem to be getting worse and worse. They are making them with obviously cheaper so-called similar ingredients but the new generic amphetamine and dextroamphetamine drugs just have bad side effects and don’t work for me at all or are far less effective. I don’t know if it is Teva brand that is making these cheap ineffective knock-offs that cause migraines & other side effects but they are definitely not working or decent. The generic form Amphetamine Salts works just fine for me but again I think when Teva took over and apparently used far cheaper Ingres there is definitely a disconnect because I don’t think Dextroamp-Amphetamin is a worthy generic form of Adderall but maybe just because Teva brand seems to be using incredibly cheap ingredients,	10	January 20, 2020	21
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Mydayis (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I've had ONE DOSE.  Let me be clear.  I took one 25mg pill 6 hours ago and I'm so sleepy I can't see straight.  I slept 7.5 hours last night so I don't understand the drowsiness.	5	January 9, 2020	33
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’ve been on adderall for a few years now and it was life changing. I’ve always been prescribed a generic and have never had a problem until recently. I noticed that I was not getting the same benefit as I was previously and for months, tried to convince myself that it was in my head and then one month, I noticed everyday that I felt great! Looked at the pill imprint and what do you know - it was a different manufacture (Amneal) than the one I was taking. I started googling it and saw a lot of complaints for generic Adderall from Global Pharmaceutical. I’m talking to pharmacist today about it and requesting the generic by Amneal Pharmaceuticals. I thought they were all the same and it’s a shame that global can make these any less effective than what they should be. Is it so people go to their dr, say they don’t feel the effects of it and get an increase? Sounds like a big pharma thing to do. Trust your gut instinct because you’re the person who knows you best.	1	January 8, 2020	17
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for Narcolepsy	I have #IdiopathicHypersomnia & #narcolepsy. Not all generics are equal  1. #Corepharma works 2. Oval, peach #Teva does not  3. Teva started carrying same dark pink, round IR as #Corepharma  4. In 2018 Teva selling the oval, peach again 5. I filled the Rx with #Sandoz (round, peach) worked almost as well 6. Corepharma was purchased by #Epic.  7. I have been relying on Sandoz since 2018  Every month I have to call pharmacies see if Sandoz is in stock. Usually they don't have it & can't to order it. #JewelOsco is the ONLY pharmacy that places orders for me.   Today (01/05/2020), JewelOsco does not have any &  unable to place an order; the supplier is out & the date available is TBD  Has anyone tried #Northstar? How does it compare to Sandoz?  How is the pharmaceutical industry allowed to do this?

ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	"I recently was given this new form of adderall from the pharmacy which was circular with just an ""A"" on one side... I did not like this new form of Adderall at all!! I assumed it would have the same effect as the typical oval shaped and it was completely different which is a little scary. It was very bitter and gross tasting unlike the football shaped one has a sweet note. It also disintegrated turning to powder immediately, as I attempted to break it in half (waste of product). I did not get any focus from it nor did I feel any different at all?? It did nothing! Then the next day got a horrible headache! I was talking with a friend who also mentioned getting the same thing recently. He mentioned having an extremely bad headache too the following day, so we now know it's from this form of adderall. I DO NOT LIKE IT. It should be pulled from the market honestly I don't know what the heck this rubbish  is but it is not adderall."	2	January 2, 2020	79
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Was first diagnosed with ADD(inattentive type) by multiple doctors at 18 years old. Out of the gate they prescribed me 60mg IR amphetamine with dextroamphetamine. I am now 26, taking 80mg/day, and have learned a substantial amount about this drug. No it won't make you any smarter or develop hidden talents, most believe this. The generic (dextroamphetamine-amphetamine IR) is cheaper than its brand (Adderall xr.) Obviously brand is set to higher standards of quality than generics, so yes brand name anything works better than generics, it's common sense. If you use it correctly and find the right manufacturer like Teva, you most likely won't find as many negatives as most people.	8	December 30, 2019	9
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I’ve been taking the generic version of Adderall for about 2 years now. I was tired all the time and couldn’t focus. I felt like a slug and when I had energy I still had brain fog, and had a hard time studying. In class, I would fidget in my chair, doodle, and listen to lectures, but nothing would stick in my head. No matter how long I studied.  I was prescribed the 7.5 mg tablet once a day and just the small dose did wonders for my energy levels and let me focus and actually get things done. It helped me talk in social situations and gave me a mood boost.  That being said, The generics changed a couple times. And I’m not sure, but I think I can tell a difference between them. After the pill wears off, my head aches, my legs throb, my body aches, and I’m nauseous and feel sick. I have flu like symptoms, which are miserable. It’s sad because it’s a really small dose and helps me so much but some of the side effects suck. You just gotta see what’s worth it to you.	8	December 24, 2019	61
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Fatigue	"This drug has absolutely saved my life. I have been diagnosed with severe CFS and depression approximately 14 years ago.  In 2015, I had my thyroid removed due to cancer, so I am on artificial thyroid. I could have slept for 20 hours a day and it wouldn't have been enough. I tend not to take it on weekends, as I don't need to be as ""awake"" as when I'm at work. I typically end up sleeping 12-14 hours straight on the days I don't take it. I would not be able to work full-time without Adderall. I have taken 30 mg for several years now and it has worked well for me; I have a hunch that it's because I don't generally take it on weekends, so my body gets that ""mini detox"" from it every week.   Really. This drug has saved my life. I can function again!"	10	December 5, 2019	24

ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for Narcolepsy	I was diagnosed with a sleep disorder/excessive daytime sleepiness and my physician prescribed me Adderall. After I found the dose that worked best for me (30mg in the morning and 10-20mg in the afternoon) I felt like a new person. I usually sleep anywhere from 12-18 hours a day when I don’t have classes or work (I don’t have to force myself up on these days with 2 alarms). I can still nap but they are not nearly as long as they used to be (3-8 hours). My grades have improved and most importantly, my attendance of class has improved! I used to sleep through class, but now I can go because my body isn’t begging for sleep. Overall it is an extremely helpful drug to treat narcolepsy/excessive daytime sleepiness. I finally feel like I have my life back! My only complaint is the dry mouth I experience every so often. I also still feel rather tired some days but it is not as NEAR as torturous as it used to be. Overall, it is extremely helpful and it has changed my life for the better.	10	November 20, 2019	54
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Not very effective; I took a  double dose which cause headaches and made me generally feel ill.  There are  better generics. Company should not be allowed to sell this medication.	1	November 17, 2019	13
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been on Adderal 10 mg for three months now. I have found it helps me so much in the morning. I need to talk to my doctor and see if I can get something for the afternoon. It's been a godsend but I don't have any anger issues just a lot of anxiety. I'm on Xanax as well three times a day and Ambien for sleep which really helps bed by 5 clock I'm wore out. And then my symptoms seem to return. I would recommend this to anyone that has concentration issues. I'm 41 years old and when I went to school they always called you slow. Which always made you look bad. I think my doctor he's wonderful and I'm going to get my Xanax upped and see if I can get something for the afternoon due to that I work many hours a day and I have to be on my toes.	9	November 2, 2019	6
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I got diagnosed with ADHD at the beginning of this school year, being my senior year of high school. Since 8th grade, I've struggled in school, been incredibly impulsive, had very strange eating habits, over-thought everything, and could never contain my anger or anxiety. Once prescribed, my life has changed. My grades went up, and in 3 months I've lost almost 30 pounds (I am still in the normal BMI range). I can control myself. I finally believe in myself because of Adderall.	9	October 29, 2019	79
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Well been on and off Adderall or Ritalin since I was 5. I'm 62 now, and take 60mg XR morning and two 30mg IR in the afternoon. For me it's a Godsend. I can pay attention now,  I'm more sociable, I'm just.......me.	8	October 23, 2019	22
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I’m 48 yo woman that was diagnosed with ADHD in elementary.  When I began (on holiday) taking it I’m extremely fatigue/zombie the first 3 days, I am not nearly as engaged with anyone/anything around me (I talk 97% less when I’m on Adderall) and it makes me feel less cognitive.  I feel like it dumbs me down.  After the 3rd day I start to feel better and those “tranquilizer effects” go away. Adderall is an emotional regulator for me. It works wonders for my impulsivity, racing thoughts, fidgeting, feeling overwhelmed, anger, anxiety, zoning out, and my mouth. Yes, my mouth has always been my biggest challenge and has caused me tremendous social/professional problems.  While in a perfect world I’d be on no medication, I have to recommend Adderall for anyone whose suffering from ADHD, because  it has changed my overall quality of life for the best.  Sparkle on beautiful people! 	9	October 23, 2019	81
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I was diagnosed with both bipolar and ADHD. After trying multiple combinations, we finally tried adderall on top of Wellbutrin, Lamictal, and Fluvoxamine for OCD. At first, the adderall did wonders. Completely made me enjoy life again. However, as my tolerance increased, the adderall crash was very intense. It resulted in a bipolar low almost everyday around the same time. I recently just switched to Stratetta and is my second day taking it. Anxious to see how this works.	9	October 22, 2019	29
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Mydayis (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I’ve been taking meds for ADHD/ADD close to 8 years now.  Tried Adderall at many dosages, types and amount of times per day over a period of many years.  My biggest issue. I forgot to take them.  Tried Vyvanse. It helped but I got nauseous, dizzy every day.  Tried Adderall again and forgot to take them.  One day my doctor mentioned Mydayis. I wouldn’t have to remember taking more than one in the AM.  After a week I could tell that it was helpful but wasn’t able to tell if a BIG difference.  I ran out due to scheduling once & my brain went into hyper drive. I hadn’t felt that chaotic for awhile.  WHILE talking to my doctor she legit wrote out the prescription, handed it to me. ‘go fill it NOW.’ Even had others asking how long I would be without it.  It was clear it helped at that point.  I don’t notice any side effects.  My results with Mydayis are pretty good. No worries of forgetting it, which was the major factor in my switch.	8	October 20, 2019	11
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Mydayis (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I'm making this review one year after trying Mydayis for only a week. I switched to this drug from Adderall IR 20's BID to the 37mg capsule, you don't really think your buzzing, but you indeed are, and more so than with Adderall for the same dose. What prompted me to write this review was that I noticed someone else who reviewed this mentioned that they would be returning the bottle to the pharmacy because they didn't want insurance to think they were keeping it. This is an effect of the drug, I too, even though I bought it on the $5 coupon, did not want the pharmacy (who does not care) to think that I wanted to keep this drug so I returned the remaining 23 capsules to them. It works well, puts you in a different state of mind, and doesn't provide the sense well being of some other ADHD products offer, but it does work better than some generics. Perhaps give this a try if you're on generics that don't work. It is pretty strong, but doesn't feel like it. if that makes sense.	7	October 14, 2019	12
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I was on 10MG XR for 3 months and it worked amazingly. This is a very good medication if you have trouble functioning like a normal person, although be prepared for really dark thoughts if you decide to stop taking it. Withdrawal from this drug is no joke, it can make you want to die...but if you keep taking it or taper off slowly you should be fine.		October 12, 2019	22
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I was diagnosed with ADD in 2005 after experiencing horrible distractibility in class while at college and not being able to focus on a single thought in my head.  I was prescribed Adderall IR and I remember feeling like I had drunk 5 Red Bulls or something!  My heart was pounding and I had horrible anxiety the whole day.  I only took it one time.  I decided to get off it immediately.  Soon after, I was prescribed Strattera, which didn't do ANYTHING.  I've gone for about 13 years without actual ADD medications because I really hated the idea of stimulants.  That all changed when I realized my ADD was getting out of control.  I saw my current psychiatrist last week who re-diagnosed me and we discussed my experiences.  I had read reviews from people here who say that Dexedrine works for them if Adderall made them too wired, so I asked if I could try that.  I just tried it today and I had no horrible side effects - no anxiety, no heart palpitations, no edginess, etc.  It is wonderful!	1	October 9, 2019	21
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for Narcolepsy	I was recently diagnosed with Narcolepsy in early 2019. I was started on Adderrall, but it took about 6 months to get the regimen that worked for me. I was quite sick at the stomach for about 3 months with nausea, and headaches. I take 30 mg at 9 am, and 10 mg at 1 pm. Finally, it's working well to a certain degree.  I still need at least two naps during the day and have most of my energy in the morning and early afternoon. Come 7-8 pm, I'm literally exhausted. I realized how well the medication worked after I missed a dose. I wondered why I was yawning all day and barely able to stay awake. It was because I had forgotten to take my Adderrall. Despite how well it works, I still seem to yawn almost constantly. I would not be able to get through the day without it. It's not 100 percent fix, but I can function for most of the day using it. So, that's a plus for me.	9	October 8, 2019	17
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for Narcolepsy	I was originally prescribed for adult ADD. I took it for several weeks with some results, but I soon learned that it was great for a sleep disorder as well. Recently, I stopped taking it, but soon afterward, all I could do was sleep all day. I was extremely fatigued. I had a blood test for hypothyroidism but it was negative. The only side effect for me was hypertension which I take medication for, but lately, it has been elevated. Nothing the doctor can't fix by increasing the dosage of my blood pressure med. I don't plan to stop this mediation unless I need a larger dosage to work. Currently taking Adderall XR 20mg in the morning and regular Adderall  20mg at noon. Moreover, it helps ease my craving for carbs. It works better than any antidepressant.		October 5, 2019	22
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Mydayis (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I have suffered my entire life with ADD.  For a while Adderal helped. Then as I turned 49 it seemed to make me more anxious, irritable,  short tempered, and I had No patience for stupidity! Upon trying the Mydayis,  I was immediately impressed. I was finishing projects.  Getting things done right! Able to focus for longer durations of time. Long enough to complete tasks at hand. I feel so much better.	10	October 3, 2019	30
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I will never give this to my child again!, I know all children are different but I'm sticking with Dyanavel XR. While he was on Adderall he was acting angry and violent, like he was on some kind of illegal drug, his facial expressions were intense, and he could not sit still, and was very emotional. so I have to give this a 1 star on my personal experience and my son's	1	October 2, 2019	35
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I've had a prescription for amphetamine with dextroamphetamine for  four years, and Teva used to work fairly well for me. Over the last year or so, it's become awful. I know it isn't me, because I still have old (2-3 years) pills laying around; I tried some of them and they work just fine.   Teva changed something in the manufacturing process. The new pills do almost nothing beneficial (I feel sleepy all day), but they have a ton of side effects. I feel very jittery, my stomach hurts, and I've been experiencing bloating.	1	September 30, 2019	23
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Overall, 20 mg Adderall XR for ADHD helps me to focus. The problem with adderall is it makes me sweat something awful. Anyone else annoyed with sweating while taking adderall?	9	September 28, 2019	62
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Well first off. Adderall is an Amphetamine  which assist with the production of dopamine. Very close  relation to meth. I am 21 years old and I started Adderall again. Previously I was on Adderall from age 8-13 and it worked great. Some say ADHD is not real and it just a symptom of bad health etc... I have been very very healthy and unhealthy which produced no changed in brain fog. Now that engineering is my main task in like I seem to have a hefty amount of brain fog. Adderall does in fact help with focus but the downside is the extreme crashes that happen when you stop taking it.	8	September 26, 2019	20
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been on Adderall for quite sometime. It has helped me focus and also being proactive. I recently got a new script and diff manufacturing teva  I noticed since I have taken it I'm extremely tired. Cannot focus at all I feel like a scatter brain..I had to call my dr to have him rewrite a new script and surrender the Teva (amphetamine with dextroamphetamine) Did anyone get the same reaction?	1	September 26, 2019	20
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I shared my experience recently on here and was going back over and reading others as well.  I believe we should all state the laboratory that producing the specific generic we are each taking. Doing so may help us all narrow down which ones to stay away from and which ones are truly therapeutic.  Eon lab  brand of amphetamine/dextroamphetamine was good until 9 months ago, now they are horrible (no therapeutic value and bad side effects).  I then I switched to Teva and they were decent for about 2 months and now they are giving me side effects.  Plus the pharmacy ran out of them and I had to wait for a new batch and when the new batch came in is when the bad side effect started.  I KNOW the drug manufacturer has changed something.  Hope that helps someone.	2	September 24, 2019	121
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Narcolepsy	I have been on generic Adderall (dextroamphetamine -amphetamine) for about a year and a half. I have always got the Teva brand with no issues. But in the last couple months I have noticed it not working as well. I just filled my script last week and they are even worse! I keep dozing off at work and back to taking naps in my car on lunch again. It's very frustrating! I take 30mg twice a day for narcolepsy. Last month during to the shortage on 30mg my script was shorted by 9 pills. This time the manufacturer was Alvogen and they were amazing! Only time I came across this manufacturer. I wish my insurance would cover the brand name. They denied me even with my doctor's appeal.	1	September 23, 2019	9
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for Narcolepsy	I have been on D-Amphetamine Salt Combo, 30mg a day for a few months for narcolepsy and actually did great. But I recently picked up another prescription and noticed this brand is called Teva generic brand. I have noticed for 2 weeks I have became irritated, forgetting easily in what I was looking for or talking about, aggressive outbursts, stomach pain, migraines, generalist not feeling good on this brand. I will be complaining over this!	1	September 15, 2019	50
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	So, I have had ADHD since I was like young. I never liked the pills they gave me when I was younger because I was already a thin kid and then taking Adderall I would eat even less. So I stopped taking the medication. When I was taking this medication I got most improved student! I went without the drug for years, until just about 2 years ago I started taking it again and It has helped me so much! I am very thankful for this drug. I suffer from fatigue , and many, many other problems. This drug is one of many I NEED, To Think Straight and to not get outta control.  It also helps me BIG TIME with my anger issues. Hope this helps someone! Star Kid Is OUT!	9	September 11, 2019	47
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	This drug is one of the greatest formulas of all time. I went from down and depressed and unmotivated to organized and focused. Also from relatively poor to rich due the effect it had on me with my enthusiasm for work	10	September 11, 2019	57
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I cannot believe that the FDA allows AUROBINDO or TEVA to sale their lousy drugs through pharmacies in the US.  Neither of these generics have any affect on me at all!!  WASTE of money!   They are playing with people's minds and well being!!!!	2	September 6, 2019	109
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Have taken Adderall on and off for around 13 years for ADD and CFS. I was lucky enough to have tried the “real” brand Adderall by Barr laboratories. I’ve never taken over 20mg a day. This medicine has gone to TRASH.The only negative side affect from the Barr version was occasional jaw clinching.   I think Teva must’ve burned the patent formula or something because it has never worked liked the Barr, not even close.  So many negative side effects (migraine headaches, heartburn, nausea)! I keep hoping at some point they might magically start producing a decent version that actually helps instead of hurts.  The original Barr had true therapeutic value.  Eon labs produced a decent generic for a while, but BAM, it suddenly went to garbage at the end of 2018.  So switched back to Teva a couple months back and it started ok( not as good as Eon but better than everything else out there), then last months refill is feeling like they’re changing to something bad too.  Bring back real Adderall!	3	September 4, 2019	78
ACT Amphetamine XR -  15MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I had taken Adderall for many years and was slowly on the decline.  I was deeply depressed and had an absolute hopeless and helpless outlook on life with no relief. I had psychosis, delusions and impulsive behavior which I never had. I began having issues with memory, thinking, reasoning, decision making, tasks, and  concentration.  I would become very agitated if being interrupted. I was very aggressive and agitated constantly, it was at least 98% of the time in 10 years.  I read horror stories about stimulants, namely the Amphetamine line of them. I subsequently tapered off of them and feel 100% better than before. I have no depressive symptoms, delusions, memory problems, agitation or aggressiveness. I was not happy with life and my personal relationships were very toxic. I wasted almost 10 years of my life feeling like this and have other personal complications that resulted from the use of these toxic drugs.	1	August 28, 2019	29
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I have taken Adderall XR and short acting for 25 years and I got this new XR 30MG the other day Lannett and it made me tired, heart racing, BP accelerated and did NOTHING to help me focus. I contacted the pharmacy and my Dr and he's trying to switch me to another brand because this is a joke. awful..	1	April 26, 2021	3
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Just started taking adderall XR 10mg after learning I had been mis-diagnosed for 15+ years as either bi-polar, major depressive disorder and social anxiety. I finally found a psychiatrist that really dug deep and concluded I was not bi polar but I suffered from adult ADHD (33 year old male). It makes total sense as I read more about ADHD. I had been on every possible anti-depressant, anti psychotic MDD etc and was just done with meds. I was diagnosed as a child and teen but thought “ I’d grow out of it” and apparently never did it just got worse. I feel that so many people are mis-diagnosed it’s almost unbelievable. My theory and the doctor also said that if you take the medication and it calms you and your racing thoughts that that’s a tell tail sign that you do indeed suffer from ADHD, it’s not just a childhood/school era problem, it disrupts your life, marriage everything. I’m on day 2 and it’s like a light switch has been turned on and I can relax and not be manic.	9	April 25, 2021	3
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been on and off generic Adderall for many years. Currently, I have been prescribed 30 mg twice a day. For the last couple of months, it's been a nightmare. It's been on backorder and then changed the generic name from amphetamine salts combo to amphetamine/ dextroamphetamine combo. This is only because I have had severe headaches, extreme fatigue, and a loss of motivation. My ADHD has been out of the roof. It's frustrating because I feel like I did before taking any generic Adderall. I have even been concerned that maybe I was receiving a placebo rather than the actual medication. That's probably far-fetched, but it's been such a decline for me. There is something missing from this generic form and it is the essential thing that is needed to control my ADHD. I have even gained a lot of weight over the past two months. Hopefully, something will give, I can't imagine it affecting people like this and nothing changing.	3	April 19, 2021	8
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	This pill does not work like any Adderall that I have experienced. There is neither the focus or the energy bump that is typically associated with the two most therapeutic aspects of the formulation. The vast majority of time I feel equally as sleepy and unfocused as I did when I took it.    I am an experienced user of this positive life-changing medication. The patients that us this medication are in a bad position when company’s that make inferior generic medications are allowed distribution rights through equally as corrupt retail pharmaceutical outlets seeking to make a few pennies extra per script, on the back of patients whose experienced opinion is rarely considered.	2	April 17, 2021	2
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I have taken ADHD meds many years. Adderall XR is the ADHD med that works the best for me. I am taking a generic manufactured by Lannett. It by far has worked the best for me with the reason(s) being is the smoothness, the come up is very quick, and it does it's job perfectly.   To reiterate, Lannett is very smooth with a quick come up, and last long enough most days.	9	April 15, 2021	4
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	If anyone else is having a terrible time with the new Lannett generic adderall you can report this to the FDA.  I have been having crippling headaches, stomach aches, and the medication doesn’t even feel like it works!!! I get tired after I take it and then can’t sleep all night because of it. HORRIBLE. Google fda medwatch online reporting to fill in the form	1	April 9, 2021	33
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Right now I take 50mg Lamictal for my Bipolar and 7.5mg twice a day Adderall for ADHD. At first I wasn't sure Adderall was going to work for me, I was initially prescribed 20mg twice a day.  That dose ended up being way too high for me, It made be become manic and I felt really wired all the time.  I now take 7.5mg twice a day and have found it to be much better. I feel alert and focused throughout the day.  Some of the side effects I have had are weight loss, jaw clenching, and mild insomnia (I usually just take melatonin). Overall, Adderall has helped me a lot, I just had to find the right dosage.	8	April 8, 2021	0
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been on Adderall for several years and the Sandoz brand is TOXIC and HORRIBLE! At first it is like a sugar pill no effect and then dizziness, headache, feeling more confused, spaced out and mind blank, extreme fatigue. I can't believe this is on the market. FDA honestly needs to step up their game and monitor the generics. It is a up and down roller coaster with different manufactures each month. This is insane. They are robbing us blind in the pharmaceutical business. They give us something toxic or a placebo. What is happening to the medications now. Please do not take the Sandoz. Read the court documents about reviews on them and they came from the company. Making themselves sound great as a pretend customer!! I can not believe how bad this medication from this manufacture is.	1	April 6, 2021	10
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Worked really well for the first week or so, but then really made me more irritable and gave me uncontrollable suicidal urges that ultimately sent me to the hospital. The suicidal urges stopped after dropping the medication.  I wouldn't recommend against the medication, I would just proceed with caution as the side effects can vary in intensity from person to person.	1	April 3, 2021	3
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I have been prescribed Amphetamine Salt Combo which has worked well(I have ADD and narcolepsy). Today I was given from RX, Amphetamine Aspertate, it make me fell kinda sickness. Was I given the wrong medicine. The prescription has not changed ?	7	April 1, 2021	3
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I’ve been on Adderrall immediate release for at least 8 years, probably more. At first Adderrall gave me an intense high and made me very talkative. Very talkative. That lasted for a few days and after that each morning when I took it it gave me a euphoric feeling for about have the day. I wasn’t making impulsive decisions like I had in the past and my focus was razor sharp. I really enjoyed this drug for sometime but the last 3-5 years it’s just been the same old same old. I take it in the morning and have somewhat of a boost in energy and focus but after around 11am the effects of the medication just wears off. I wind up feeling irritable, decent level of focus if I’m busy at work, and just downright not very social with people. This week I’m going to see my P.A. and hopefully get on Vyvanse which I was encouraged by many to try before jumping on Adderrall. Vyvanse is more expensive but I’m ready to feel more focused and more myself.	5	March 28, 2021	4
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	This review is for generic Adderall XR - amphetamine/dextroamphetamine. I've experienced wildly different effects from different manufacturers. Some days it didn't work. Some days it worked great. But I got severe debilitating headaches that lasted 24/7 and didn't go away using ibuprofen. Went to neurologist and got an MRI. If I could push past the side effects it did work well but for only about 4-5 hours after kicking in (which took about an hour). Needed a booster of IR in the afternoon, so eventually I couldn't deal with the headaches and switched to IR completely. Headaches gone almost immediately. I still get them with IR but not anywhere near as often or as bad.	6	March 23, 2021	1
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Mydayis (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	"I've tried several ADHD meds and Mydayis has definitely been the best for me. I'm on the lowest dose and it starts working 20-30 minutes after I take it. I'm then able to be productive and direct my focus easily, compared to other meds (eg-Adderall) which gave me a burst of intense focus that I had no control over. The transitions are barely noticeable and it really helps maintain consistent energy levels. After wearing off, it's a very natural ""I've worked all day and now I'm ready to relax before bed"" feeling (no crash). I also noticed it significantly helps manage my depression-something no other ADHD med has done. The only downsides: (1) it does reduce my appetite a lot and (2) it only lasts about 9-10 hours on my current dose (12.5mg), but higher doses (25mg+) give me headaches. It's not perfect, but the positives definitely outweigh the negatives for me. Lastly-you don't know how it'll affect you, so don't let reviews scare you away if you/your doc think it might help."	9	March 21, 2021	4
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I was diagnosed with ADHD at age 17 and only really started taking stimulant medication after I had turned 20 last year. I was originally trying out varying doses of IR but started trying XR in the past few months.  Overall: Hit or miss for me. It does help with my focus, but the side effects and how much it helps varies pretty drastically depending on the day. Biggest side effects are dehydration, lack of appetite, potentially crashing at night (normal). I also feel a bit uncomfortable sometimes (anxiety-ish twitchy feeling) but that's not very common.  The mallinckrodt brand I was switched to recently seems maybe a bit more hit or miss honestly I can't really tell that much of a difference (unlike people on opioids who swear that mallinckrodt is awful). I'm on 25mg for now and I'm gonna keep seeing how I feel in the coming weeks. Helps with ADHD no doubt, but do be weary of the side effects.	7	March 16, 2021	2
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Mydayis (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I took Mydayis 37.5 mg for 2 years. I just recently ran out and decided to wait a week to refill. I cannot believe the change in myself! While on it I became withdrawn and too focused on 1 specific thing. I cut out people and ruined my small business. I didn't feel human! I can't explain the feeling but now that I haven't taken it in a week I feel like myself again! I was just flesh living day by day on mydayis! I will NEVER touch it again! Please tell me there's others out there with similar experiences	1	March 12, 2021	5
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	"I have been taking teva 20mg adderall from 06-19 when they disappeared. I had already suffered from side effects from other generics due to CVS giving me a different generic a few times without consent or being informed. I did the whole google wormhole for a few months before finally seeing a random comment about ""INACTIVE"" ingredients and how this person suffered terrible side effects across multiple generic medications with this same ""INACTIVE"" ingredient. Being on multiple meds myself and having autoimmune and neuro disorders it affected my mental health knowing something wasn't right and just not grasping why & not understanding. That random comment changed everything for me ""INACTIVE"" does not equal no effect.  Teva not being an option then and now not at all I use Mallinckrodt and Arubindo 20 mg. I find it helps to switch them every couple months or I take M in the morning and A in the afternoon depending on how my body is functioning. I tried SAndoz that was terrible side effects."	8	March 6, 2021	2
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Narcolepsy	I've been on adderall 20 mg 3× a day for over 10 years from secondary narcolepsy due to a TBI. I will only take Teva there plenty of generics that don't work and are less than a 10% out of 100% I got these I think Mallinckrodt U30 on it I tried returning it after taking 3 and falling asleep they wouldn't return so I took about 7 more just to get home from the pharmacy 1hour drive without passing out it did nothing. If I took 4 Teva I'd bounce off the walls won't sleep for at least 1 day. I will never again take anything besides the Teva after sleeping for the remainder of the month. I wish I could afford the brand name. Don't listen to any pharmacist generic aren't close I can't believe they get away with saying there same as brand lol body doesn't lie. Scumbags looking for profit due not caring who suffers	9	March 5, 2021	5
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	My 7 year old son is a first grader and was recently diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. He has been recommended Adderall for this but I am a bit reluctant to initiate its usage. I have a few reservations about how long it lasts in our system which I have heard can prove to be dangerous for a young kid. I have read multiple articles like these, but I am still not so sure. Seeing the number of experienced people here, please tell me if I should continue with it.		March 4, 2021	4
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	First time taking Alvogen generic amphetamine with dextroamphetamine 30mg. Been taking adderall for 2 years but always Teva generic. Oh my God, the Alvogen brand has made me feel so sick. All over severe headache, nauseous, vomiting, diarrhea. I feel awful. No focus, no energy, can't keep anything down, running to the bathroom.	1	February 27, 2021	8
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Been taking adderall for years. Until the had me try a white stop sign shaped one by mallinckrodt since there was an adderall shortage at my Walgreens. mallinckrodt amphetamine/dextroamphetamine shouldn’t even be labeled as amphetamine/dextroamphetamine it should just be sold as a caffeine pill because all it does is wake you up subtlety. It doesn’t help with focus whatsoever. I’ve already filed a complaint with the FDA and recommend everyone else do the same	1	February 25, 2021	20
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I take the 10 mg amphetamine with dextroamphetamine by Teva and it works great, better than the 15 mg.in my opinion. I see others mentioning generics by Alogen and Mallinckrodt here. Well I take a couple of other medications manufactured by these 2, on and off, most times it's Mallickrodt. Let me tell you, this is the WORST drug manufacturer on the market. The Alogen is junk too. I've been on a few medical chat sites just to see what I can find out about Mallinckrodt and see if others felt the same way and they absolutely do! Literally 100's of people have complained to the co. itself and to the FDA. This has been going on for a solid 5 years at least & the stuff is STILL pure unadulterated JUNK.	7	February 21, 2021	23
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Mydayis (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Switched from Concerta to Mydayis for the longer duration mechanism Mydayis offers. Was started on 25mg of Mydayis. ADD symptoms improved but I experienced dry mouth, dizziness, heart increase, and appetite decrease which subsided after the first week. Second week I felt like the dose was not effective. Doc switched me to 37.5mg of the mydayis and so far symptoms of ADD improved but side effects are rough. Dry mouth, headache, dizziness, lack of appetite, increased anxiety. I’m on day 4 or 5 so hoping the side effects subside when my body adjusts to the higher dose... fingers crossed.	6	February 20, 2021	4
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I am currently on Adderall XR 30MG, and it has changed so many different aspects of my life, including depression.  I was prescribed Adderall because I was about to be terminated from my job. Back to the drug, I take it around 6am everyday, and found that my overall mood has changed. I am not as emotional as I was before, yet I am still able to express my feelings when necessary without the full breakdowns. I have been dealing with Major Depressive Disorder, and this medication has alleviated most of those feelings.  However, the medication has not been a miracle drug, and it contains no magic! For me, ADD has always been there. For me, it took me to be 36 years old to finally realize it was time to visit a psychiatrist, regardless of all the negative stigmas; I was glad I did, because it gave me many suspected answers, rather than self diagnosing situations.	9	February 15, 2021	17
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’ve taken adderall for years. I used to be on Lannett brand and Walgreens recently switched to TEVA. I had my script switched from CVS to Walgreens because it was closer to me. I have been on it for 3 months and the side effects are TERRIBLE.  I clench my teeth so bad my teeth have broken, I am severely depressed, I can’t find happiness in literally anything. I don’t feel motivated at all. If anything I feel less motivated to get out of bed. My skin is dry, my eyes are sinking in and I get terrible migraines. My anxiety is so bad I’m anti social, and I thought I had a stroke because of side effects. I’m 25. Just don’t take it		February 13, 2021	7
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I take two 30 mg pills a day for ADHD and it has really made a huge difference in my life. I am able to focus on one task at a time and complete it. Works great for giving me the motivation I sometimes lack. Only issue is that when I was given the white or peach ones, they did not seem to work as well as the pink ones. Talked to doctor about it and she added to my prescription to only receive the pink ones. Curious if anyone else has had this issue	9	February 10, 2021	34
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	ALVOGEN INC has got me all messed up. I've taken ADHD meds since 1st grade and I'm 32 now so I'm very confident in my ability to distinguish between generics that work & don't and why. For the past 4 years I've used the same CVS location to fill my Adderall tab 30mg generic the past two times though I received a pill that looked different thinking okay whatever this happens from time to time it is just a different manufacturer no big deal. I was wrong. I have had insanely high blood pressure increases, trouble sleeping, hardly any focus, SEVERE anxiety like where is feel like I can't breathe suddenly especially when I try to sleep, shaky hands, VERY noticeable heart palpitations, diarrhea, headaches and  weird emotional ups & downs. I've been vegan for 3 months now at first I was seeing a steady decrease in blood pressure but as soon as I started taking this new generic I'm topping out at 161/111 at the doctor a few days ago which is just absolutely bonkers and terrifying	2	February 9, 2021	9
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’ve taken TEVA adderall 20 mg IR for the past 2+ years. It worked greatly for my ADD & as an anti-depressant. HOWEVER, it has changed! Starting July 2020, the TEVA tablet was completely different. It was no longer sweet, the consistency was harder & the efficacy was compromised. I can take it & fall asleep hours later & there is ZERO anti-depressant effect. In fact, it deepens my depression.  I will submit a report to the FDA & I encourage everyone else to. Also, please research the complaints of TEVAs other generics. I’m not sure what to try next. I tried the Sandoz and it was actually worse. I received the hideous Zydus once-which gave me a migraine & intensely aching back.I believe it’s manufactured out of this country.  This experience has made me question ALL generic medications.   Please start researching yours & refuse to take these.  I tried switching to name brands but my ins. refuses to pay.	2	February 8, 2021	11
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Have used a generic for about 6 years now worked for me except it has turned me into a teeth grinder I do it all the time and now my teeth are worn to the point they are ruined.  My doctor said he never heard of that side effect but a recent visit to a dentist to try to fix my teeth I was told they see this all the time and this grinding may never go away. I need to find something that works without these side effects	6	February 4, 2021	9
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine)	My cardiologist who diagnosed me with dysautonomia prescribed me adderall in high school because my symptoms included extreme fatigue, brain fog, and *bad* orthostatic hypotension. He did not warn me about all the side effects I would experience (due partly to the fact that I do not have ADHD), and I was given a high dose to start. It did help with my fatigue and immensely improved my focus (can’t complain there, I was *hyper* focused), brain fog, and hypotension, but there were some questionable side effects I experienced for the almost 2 years I took it: complete lack of appetite, significant weight loss, resting tachycardia and angina (my dysautonomia makes my HR very high to begin with) Overall it definitely improved my quality of life for a time but it seems like a questionable Rx for people with this condition who are hyper adrenal, already experiencing an overactive sympathetic ANS, and have a high HR due to the cardio effects.	7	January 27, 2021	3
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I’ve been in this medication for almost a year . And it change my life in good way.

In the last year, I noticed right away something was off. First was the obvious color. The Teva that has always worked for me with no problems (that was being weaned out in 2019) was as follows..  peach color and sweet, easy to swallow and not gag on. Teva now, is orange. The sweet taste that made it bearable to take has changed completely. My focus, clarity, motivation, and concentration has been/is immensely effected by the new ingredient change. (I don't have it at all)  My overall mental health, has declined quickly. It has caused my mood to completely change, headaches are constant, and upset stomach. All of this, and they don't even work. I struggle everyday now. Less main ingredient and more fillers means more pills can be produced, which means more money in the manufacturer's pocket..... Mental health should be top priority, especially being consistent with and not changing the ingredients.	1	January 17, 2021	50
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	This month is the first time I received sandoz adderall ER and it doesn't seem to work very well for me. Mallinckrodt doesn't seem to work too well for me either. I think Teva seems to work the best for me; even better than the name brand for adderall.	6	January 17, 2021	2
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I have suffered with ADHD since I was a young kid, I got diagnosed at the youngest age possible and I never got any help for it by my old doctor.  With my new doctor, he gave me Adderall XR to start out with 10 and than up it to 20 within a week if not effective.   I am on 20 MG now and it has changed my life, I failed school and life because I couldn't pay attention and now not only can I pay attention but this has also helped as my ADHD had caused Depression/Anxiety also OCD.	10	January 15, 2021	14
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Generic Adderall varies significantly depending on mfg. Reason being, the FDA says the mfg only has to “demonstrate” it “works in the same way “ as the brand-name. i.e. generic ingredients do  Not have to be same which is why so many don’t work and/or make people feel sick. My experience, the only generic that works like the brand-name is Prasco, which acquired Teva’s generic xr in 2016.  Few pharmacies use Prasco as their generic because it’s more expensive!  My Dr specifies “Prasco generic only” on my prescription for D-Amphetamine ER 30MG Salt combo. By law, the pharmacy must comply if Prasco is one of their overall suppliers. My insurance changed so I called Prasco to see if they sell to Costco. They do. Just takes a day or 2 for the pharmacist to order and fill my script. Walgreens used Prasco as their generic until recently. Now it’s Mallinckrodt which just filed for bankruptcy to settle a slew of opioid lawsuits. It’s all about $		January 8, 2021	59
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	The adderall name brand is 2-3 times better than generic adderall XR. The FDA should be inspecting these generic companies and make sure they are getting as high of quality ingredients. I urge anyone in generics to try real adderall for a month then decided for yourself. Decide to report the generics because we should be able to get a cheaper still 90$ for generic compared to $220+ for name brand.	10	January 7, 2021	18
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’m a doctor with ADHD. I’ve been on the generics to cut costs during tough times but I insist on the name brand adderall. No only is it smoother it lasts longer and helps even more than the generics. It’s a shame that cost is a bearing on necessary prescriptions and that generic are so much weaker and poorer quality. Generic adderall needs to step it up they have quality issues and their recipe is somehow flawed.	5	January 7, 2021	25
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for Narcolepsy	I was diagnosed with a severe case of narcolepsy about a year ago. I always thought it was my chronic fatigue that made me feel so sleepy all the time. I was finally referred to a sleep specialist who ordered a night and day time sleep study. When I received the results he told me I was a very sleepy person, his worst case in many years. I have been taking 20MG Adderall 3x a day. It does help but I'm still extremely tired throughout the day. The sleep doctor advised me in September that there's a newer medication that can be added to my Adderall but insurance didn't like to approve it and that in 6 months hopefully it will be easier to prescribe. I've seen somewhere that 60MG a day is the max for treating ADHD but that 90MG is the max for treating narcolepsy. I'm curious if that dose would improve my symptoms. Overall I'm happy with the medication as I never notice any side effects. I just want to feel more awake and less sleepy.	7	January 6, 2021	9
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)		Alvo Adderall sucks. It doesn’t work at all. I'm so annoyed that  my month will suck while taking this brand	1	January 4, 2021	4
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Mydayis (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I've only been taking it for 3 days but I can understand now when people say they feel it running in the background. So far no side effects other than appetite loss. I do feel energy from this but not like Adderall there's no anxiety tied to the energy its more like motivation than energy. One thing I've noticed is I like to always be doing something that is productive in some way. It's not the type of energy you get and use to dance or workout you feel driven to get things done.  It last for the whole 16 hours which surprised me I'm an ultra rapid metabolizer. I have no crash on this like I did with Adderall. I'm just waiting for my period now to see how the cramps are and giving the medicine more time to see if I do have any side effects, so far none but no appetite.	10	January 3, 2021	11
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I've been taking dextroamp-amphet ER 15mg once a day for roughly 3 months now and it's helped me greatly until 2 weeks ago and it's as if I cut my dose by 3/4! Is this normal and what dose, frequency, and type of adderall should I change to? I've heard about generic vs name brand, so what do the best ones look like?	6	December 30, 2020	1
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I've been prescribed adderall for 10yrs+ and without it mentally and physically I would be worse. I do have soreness, achy body, etc but have other health problems. Adderall has ROTTED MY TEETH OUT. Being 42 years old, fear ability to retain with out medicine as I age. I have severe withdrawal, to include extreme fatigue, severe constipation. I need the Adderral and helps some as without it life would be more difficult. All and all I would not manage without it very well but it is less effective as been taking for years. Take care and God Bless All. Be Safe!	7	December 24, 2020	10
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Narcolepsy	I take the regular Adderall 20mg in the morning, but do 10mg in the afternoon; along with my other prescribed stimulants since mornings are the hardest for me. I got a new prescription and after a couple days of feeling like complete rubbish and having unscheduled naps each day, I noticed it was different.   After having the name brand and suddenly switching to this generic; it made sense why I suddenly felt like I could never wake up, even on 480mg of stimulants each day. Even as I write this at almost 11pm, I have felt like I can't do anything but lay down and nod off throughout the day.  These generics are different and affect our quality of life. When your treatment works and suddenly you feel like you aren't even taking your medicine because of a sudden switch to a placebo-like generic is a huge problem.  Where is the consistency for these medications!?	1	November 30, 2020	25
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for Narcolepsy	Adderall worked well for a year then it wore off even with medication free holidays. When trying a new medication and stopping I didn’t realize how out of breath it was making me, I thought it was because I was fat.	3	November 25, 2020	7
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Fatigue	I just tried Alvogen brand of amphetamine/dextroamphetamine this month because my pharmacy. It is absolutely awful. I feel like my body is screaming, absolutely doesn’t help with energy or attention. Just increases anxiety. And I’m extremely lethargic. I strongly recommend against them.	1	November 25, 2020	27
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Regarding the post by DrKatz on 11/7/2020:.  I too take the 20 mg salt combo- manufactured by Teva, and have been on that specific brand for two and a half years.  I can definitely concur that something has changed with their product.   I am on a prescription of 80 mg a day and I too noticed a difference in taste, consistency of the pill itself, and it not working as well as it used to.  I am aware of a recall May 22nd by Teva for a few of their doses- the 20mg pill being one of them.   Thinking placebo, I inspected the pill closely: the depression level of the imprint is different, slight change in the oblong shape, the edging* (*like the cut/side profile of floor boards) and thickness + curvature.   The taste difference (bitter) I noticed in August. October back to normal but currently (Nov.) the taste changed again- however this time with a much greater chemical profile- like bactine or rubbing alcohol, more crumbly and not working as well for either my ADHD or narcolepsy.	8	November 15, 2020	29
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I’ve been on Adderall XR 20 mg since October 6th 2020. I have to say this medication is life changing and your psychiatrist, doctor or whatever will try and find the right dosage for you. I’m 22 years old, Male and I noticed the medication working within an hour, I’m about 220 pounds 5’8 and despite that it still kicked in relatively fast. The side affects I notice the most are as follows dry mouth, appetite suppression, some irritability, and insomnia on occasion. Adderall XR for me last anywhere from 8-12 hours, if it wears off the medical professional in most cases will add Adderall IR to take in the afternoon, since upping the dose of XR will not increase duration only the intensity of the medication itself. ADHD medication is all about finding what’s right for YOU, don’t give up if it doesn’t get manageable or fixed after the first try.	9	November 8, 2020	41
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have always used Teva Adderall IR because I have had horrible experiences with other generic, including inconsistency and lack of potency.  Understand that I have taken Teva Adderall 20MG tablets over five years, thus it would less difficult for someone like me to detect subtle changes in its effects.  I have noticed the following, and this started around September 2020.  Teva generic Adderall tablets seem (and this is very subtle) smaller in size. Second: Teva is known for its slight sweet taste. It is almost as if that is completely  gone... I’m certainly not saying that added anything to it, but I’m saying it’s an indicator  of some sort of formula change.  Finally, although the 20MG tablet is small, it used to be easy to half the tablet. Recently they just crumble. To summarize, I have also noted a very marked decrease in efficacy.	7	November 7, 2020	26
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Adderall XR is Life changing (positively). I went from being massively distractable and procrastinate constantly to getting things done. I'm not just referring to school work or office work. I mean just showing up on time to meet up with friends. Not getting instantly bored with family.  I truly love it!   --- Quick warning, take it as your doctor recommends! So much of the bad press comes from people abusing the drug.  Likewise, if you're able, take a day off now and then. Perhaps on days when you don't need to work or do much. It's sort of like coffee/tea/caffeine in that sense. Fine if you do take it everyday, but probably best if you give your mind/body a rest from it now & then.  Just like running or exercise, you need light or rest days each week to really get the most from the workout.	10	November 6, 2020	33
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	My grades instantly went from the 60s and 70s to 90s and 100s and for once I felt like I had control over my life. The side effects were pretty bad and inconsistent though, so I had to go from 20 to 15 mg.	9	November 4, 2020	18
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine)	My son had been on every ADHD meds made by mankind since he was 5. He is 17 now, and because I go read reviews after the doctor changes his meds. I thought it might help someone who has went through all of them also. Adderall was the worst . My son was happy, enteric, easy go lucky and even on daytrana.  Ritalin, foculian, etc. he never lost himself. On adderall he was drowning mentally. Depression set in, moodiness, anger, punching walls, so mad he would black out, etc. Be very careful !!!!! Do not choose this one if you but all help it!	1	October 26, 2020	9
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	The Adderal dose my doctor prescribed didn't seem to work that great(20 mg twice a day)  One day I had it after my oatmeal and it was more effective so after that I just scrunched up the pill like I did with oatmeal, but I didn't put it on anything.  I just took it like that. Works great!  Much more motivation to get tasks done so I can finish more!  Maybe you could try that if it sees not enough to work.  I use Sandoz.	10	October 11, 2020	20
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for Narcolepsy	I was switched to Adderall but after 2 years switched to Ritalin. Adderall seems to open up parts of your brain best left closed. I started to see a 12 year old boy in the yard during the day he would be gone when I went to talk with him. My neighbors told me that in the 1970s he died here. You have to watch the dosage	10	October 10, 2020	26
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for Narcolepsy	I have been soooo sleepy for the past 15 years of my life. I finally found a PA that listened to me about my sleepiness. She has been great. I can not afford the recommended sleep study. I am currently taking 10mg extended release. It has helped but I am still falling asleep at work. My PA will meet with me in after a month on it. I’m not sure if I need an increased dosage or if it’s not working on me. It’s a struggle still. I don’t want to feel hopeless that I can’t find help.	6	October 9, 2020	11
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Adderall XR was originally prescribed to me for ADD, but it worked best as a terrific antidepressant.  However, now that I've been on it for 20 straight years at 40-80 mg. Daily, it has very little antidepressant effect now. It's Adderall burnout -- apparently it strips the brain of dopamine -- the feel-good hormone.        I still have to take it just to do anything at all each day.  The worst effect is insomnia -- no matter how early I take it.  It keeps me up for 24 hours unless I finally have to take Seroquel for sleep.  Seroquel is the only thing that will knock out Adderall XR.  But I hate it because it makes me so damn sluggish in the morning, awful.        I cannot believe it's 2020, and there is still no decent antidep medication available,	8	October 1, 2020	31
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	The last 9 months generic “Zydus” was the only brand of amphetamine/dextroamphetamine available in my area. I noticed pretty nasty side effects beginning 45 minutes after consumption. I’ve never felt depression so severely before taking Zydus. Teva/Barr has returned. Felt a night and day difference the first day. Hope Zydus gets banned for the safety of us all.	1	September 23, 2020	20

ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Mydayis (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I switched over to Mydayis in hope of finding something that could last the entire day. My days are usually nonstop for approx 16 hours. I started at the lowest dose and went up to the 50mg after 3 weeks. Gave it a few more weeks in hopes that it would work like how we wanted it to. The negative side effects outweigh the positives. The first thing I noticed was ejaculatory anhedonia. It led to an unplanned pregnancy before I caught it. The rest included falling behind in classes and not being able to keep up at work. Felt lazy and not wanting to do anything. It was like being unmedicated all over again!	4	September 21, 2020	8
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine)	I am so confused but feeling better just knowing I am not alone. I am very sensitive to any changes in medication. I have been on 10 mg twice daily for about 10 months. The pharmacy has switched generic brands multiple times. I did well on one made by Sun Industries but am not doing well on Teva. Apparently they make the name brand which I didn’t know until tonight. I would also like to know how we can change the way generics are approved. The variations are laughable and can really cause problems. I’m hesitant to switch to a different generic because what always happens is they stop making it or the pharmacy can’t get it. I requested name brand so at least it’s consistent. Any suggestions? So frustrated! Best to you all.	7	September 21, 2020	41
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for Narcolepsy	This medicine is god send. I have been suffering with narcolepsy for about 5 years. Had no idea what I was doing wrong that I cannot keep my eye open. I am talking about sleeping for 8-9 hours and then waking up and wanting to go back to sleep. I am a public school teacher and I had no choice but to be at work all day. That was a struggle and I was embarrassed to even tell my coworkers. This summer, so many unpleasant events happened in my life, I decided to talk to my psychiatrist about unable to concentrate and the excessive sleeping pattern. He wanted me to try adderall and bam!! I haven’t taken a nap since August . I do not have any side effects, not glittery, no overworking , nothing. Just ready to start the day and get in with my life. I usually go to bed around 9:30pm and sleeps well. I take 20 mg twice a day. But if you miss a dose, back to square one. I am religiously on a schedule and take them at the same time everyday. I am in my mid 40’s.	10	September 17, 2020	38
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Generic Adderall:  TEVA vs. ALVOGEN “All generic adderall is NOT the same trust me!...... I don’t care what your physician or pharmacist may say.“  I’ve taken Adderall for nearly 25 plus years for ADD.  WHY? it works twice as good ask anyone whose taken different brands before. For the BEST quality and most potent adderall on the market is made by a company called TEVA.  Even pharmacist tell me when they run out of TEVA and must use ALVOGEN their patients complain because the pharmacies cannot keep TEVA in stock because the consumers know it’s the best and most effective for ADD and ADHD.	1	September 15, 2020	131
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have taken both Adderall and its generic(amphetamine/dextroamphetamine) for over 16 years for my Adult Attention Deficit Disorder. I have found that the original Adderall has the best effectiveness and in these last 4 tears Teva [still oval, peach/orange color] working the best for my A.D.D. Pills made by Mallinkrodt I only get by mistake, and still act like a placebo in May 2020. Dose: 20mg. X 2 daily.		August 25, 2020	24
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I do not like this formula. I have been on various generics for years and did not feel like this 10 mg did anything. Unfortunately, I've already filled this prescription and am stuck with this medication.	1	August 24, 2020	7
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been taking Adderall for most of my adult life and Walgreens always carried the generic version that worked best for me but recently they changed who they get it from now and the new amphetamine / dextroamphetamine from Lannett MFG SUCK!  They do not work at all - actually the worst next to the  YELLOW ROUND Mp 447's, PINK ROUND Cor 136's, or OCTAGON WHITE ONES.   The TEVA amphetamine/dextroamphetamine Peach Oval B 974's are the ones that work best for me and now I don' t know how to get them - Help..	10	June 16, 2020	93
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	My concern in taking generic Adderall IR for several years is the effect is has on my heart  When I take it, at the prescribed dose,  I most always have sinus tachycardia  (a heart rate above 100 beats per minute)  I also have noticed that it effects bladder emptying....and my urinary stream seems slower (and I am fairly young) and I am not usually able to completely empty my bladder.	6	June 10, 2020	26
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Since the shortage for about 3 months I've been taking generic Zydus 20mg. How do these drugs pass inspection? I think a couple pixie sticks would work better. I wonder if generic adderall from any manufacturer will ever get better. I think charging over $5.00 for this rubbish should be criminal.	1	June 7, 2020	40
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	This medication amphetamine/dextroamphetamine has made me feel VERY JITTERY and sick to my stomach! I take generic TEVA brand orange tab 30 mg. The pharmacy didn’t have any of the TEVA brand so they gave me generic U31 tablet - Aurolife Pharma, LLC brand. This is horrible! People take time off work to be seen by doctor, get put on meds for a reason, spend money for the appointment and meds, all the time you spend doing this & it can’t be returned back to Walmart to get my right medicine because “it’s against the law” supposedly! Even when I have the entire prescription (minus one) to give them back. Why make people feel like this when they do so much to try and make life easier being on their meds. I don’t have insurance so my doc visit is almost $100 & medicine is around $60 every month. My 7 year old daughters meds were switched as well. I’m scared to even give her medicine! How can Walmart just give you a different brand that you’ve never taken and not tell me before I leave it’s different!?	1	June 5, 2020	67
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Fatigue	I have been through about all anti-depressants, mood stabilizers, and anti-psychotics for my severe treatment-resistant depression and this medicineamphetamine/dextroamphetamine has saved me. Honestly, I have horrible anxiety as well. I have Chronic PTSD and Generalized Anxiety Disorder. This medicine calms my nerves as well. I can actually take naps during the day now when I need to instead of not being able to rest. It helps my impulsiveness from my Bipolar Disorder that is included in my Schizoaffective diagnosis. I may have to deal with the hallucinations but this medicine is the only medicine that works for me in the most positive way. For me, it has way less severe side effects than any medicine I have tried. It mainly helps with my energy levels which helps my depression because I feel more useful I also am more social which helps my confidence. The only thing I struggle with is the lack of appetite and it seems like water goes right through me. But, It is definitely a life saver for me. <3	10	May 3, 2020	32
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I am a male in my thirties. Adderall is the third drug I tried to tread ADHD after doing trials on Vyvanse and Concerta. Vyvanse worked but did not last long enough and I had bad crashing (headache, exhaustion). Concerta did not work for me at all, made me lethargic and even more distracted.  Adderall at 20mg a day gives me energy to focus on work and my kids. It lasts me until sometime in the evening. I have trouble sleeping some nights on it, other than that the side effects are negligible.	8	May 3, 2020	43
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Activist Dextramp-amphet ER (30 mg.) [ generic for Adderall ]  is HORRIBLE. NOT effective.

ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for Narcolepsy	Generic Adderall is not the same. I feel immediately awful when I realize they switched me to generic dextro amp (amp salts works not sure what brand. I heard Teva might have moved distribution centres and have been alternating approved cheaper alternative ingredients. Well guess what they don’t work AT ALL. Check the generic brands when you get your script filled and see how you feel. The old generic brand I took worked just fine. I cannot get out of bed for weeks because whatever “similar” generic cheap alternatives they are using do not make the cut. Welcome back debilitating fatigue!	6	April 12, 2020	129
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Adderall is very useful but recently I was ignorant and thought it would be okay to take a little extra at night to help clean my house. I took a bigger extra dose then I should have and a few hours later I felt pretty awful. I am very productive and more positive on the right dose of this med, so I recommend trying it or Desoxyn, because it is said to have fewer side effects like anxiety and panic and irritability post dose. Like all meds, Adderall is a blessing when dosed right and a curse when dosed incorrectly. I noticed that I paced around a bit when on it but I didn’t feel that anxious. It isn’t fun and enjoyable to take a big dose, don’t do it. God made everything to be used in moderation and it is much better for the whole society when we obey the wise instructions of our doctors and leaders. Be careful, obey your doctor, and may God bless you all to succeed in your treatment plans and in your lives. Amen	8	March 18, 2020	74

ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Recently changed pharmacies and didn't realize that there can be quite a difference between generics. For 4 years I’ve taken adderall 2x day, 10 mg. Never any problems until I switched pharmacies to save $.  Elite Pharma is who makes this new one and it is NOT GOOD.   I am lethargic, unable to focus, quite sleepy.  It’s as if I haven’t even taken anything.  Incredibly frustrating as I am not even half way through this months supply.	1	March 7, 2020	50
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	The generic manufacturer of amphetamine & dextroamphetamine, Sandoz, is the only one that works for me. This month the manufacturer is Northstar and last month Aurobindo, and they are garbage. They don’t help AT ALL with my focus. Zero.  I am irritable. I am getting nothing done and my anxiety is sky high. I am going to stop taking these brands and ask pharmacy for Sandoz.  I complained to the FDA and urge others to do so as well. This is ridiculous.	1	March 3, 2020	70
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Adderall has worked great for me when taken as needed. When I was in my early 20’s and taking it daily I built up a dependence that lead to terrible withdrawals as it is very addictive. (Learned the hard way and never want to go through that again!)  I will usually only take this when my ADHD symptoms are unbearable and my work/personal life starts to become affected. We are talking maybe 1-4 tablets max per month.  It really does help with focus and energy, and I find that one 10-20mg dose is usually enough and I feel good for several days after the dose without any withdrawals or dependence issues.

ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	If you're taking for ADHD please note there are a lot of side effects, having said this, they are sometimes serious so take note to talk to your doctor. If you get cold fingers or toes, make sure to consult your doctor as it's a syndrome that can be prevented.  It does help with focus, it helps with impulse control, it helps with a general overall euphoric feeling and it can cause you to lose a lot of weight. Be sure to eat, EAT, don't shake your head, you know I'm talking to you. Eat and stay hydrated it causes you to urinate a LOT, make sure to supplement what you are losing. It will cause tremors, shakes, and irritability, again, eat food. Make sure to stick to a 2000 calorie diet AT LEAST. May cause muscle fatigue and extreme soreness, stay hydrated, make sure of this.  Some say it causes better grades in school, well, to an extent. It just makes you write a lot. Eat Eat Hydrate And maybe take melatonin to help promote rest. I warned and entertained you.	7	February 21, 2020	97
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	My daughter developed tardive dyskinesia, a permanent drug-induced movement disorder, while on Adderall. If your kid has ODD, stay away from all stimulates; they are most at-risk.	1	February 19, 2020	26
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I totally agree that the new A 79 generics are no good.  I mean they work a little bit, but I feel taking the same amount of the other oblong orange ones that taste like sweet we’re way better.  These taste like nasty chalk.    I’ve never had adderal brand though so I wouldn’t that difference.	3	February 19, 2020	25
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I have been on  adderal 15mg 2×daily  for 7 yrs it has completely change my life.  I  was always down, depressed, unmotivated, impulsive, always day dreaming, short attention span, no focus and couldn't sitting still. Adderal has given me a new happy life that I can enjoy and appreciate. Starting to think I need to go up to 20mg. I can feel I'm getting used to them. But without them I wouldn't get out of bed and would waste my life.I  think adderal is my miracle drug I have never been so grateful for a prescription drug	10	February 17, 2020	111
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I was diagnosed with ADHD combined type and have tried Ritalin and Focalin. Both weren't that great for me so my doctor prescribed me 10 mg of Adderall XR. Adderall has made me have better multitasking skills and helped me pay attention. It hasn't really helped with being hyper or being impulsive and has given me bad twitching eyes. It also has made my sleep schedule weird so watch out for that.	6	February 6, 2020	23
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Picked up amphetamine with dextroamphetamine medicine 1/24/20, bottle said Barr brand? But Teva tabs were inside. Teva bought Barr in 07. Before Teva bought out multiple companies and started using their ingredients within the last 2-3 years, they were great. Sandoz and Corepharma have been the only other decent makers, before they were bought out. I haven’t noticed a thing from picking these up 1/24. The worst medicine I’ve had from Teva in 8 years.	1	February 4, 2020	36
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	On 1/24/2020 I received Teva generic IR Adderall like I usually have for the last 7 years off and on (used to be good.) Except Barr was labeled on the bottle for the first time ever. Not sure why since Teva bought Barr in 07. Regardless it isn’t any better, by far the worst I’ve had of Teva. But every other company is pathetic. Brand works 10X better but 10X pricier. If the FDA enforced the rule of not less than 80% and no more than 125% concentrated effectiveness, that would be a first! The right MG of each dose might be regulated, but the fillers/inactive ingredients added is the big issue. 1-3 used to be in the old Barr/ Shire/ Sandoz/ Core and those worked fantastic. Every generic now has 5-8 fillers that make it less effective but also cause severe side effects. FDA could care less about small market drugs.	1	February 3, 2020	50
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Game changer. First DX by A pdoc: ADHD. What, no?  Yes.  I felt like I was only working with one puzzle piece and finding out about ADHD was like being given the other 999 pieces. At first Adderall IR didn’t seem to do much but I slowly realized it was like putting emotional and mental blinders on where I could see the rest of the world but mainly focus on the task at hand. Job saver for sure.  Since I have a high tolerance to meds XR saved me from constantly trying to remember to take next dose when I started crashing. Tops.	10	February 3, 2020	30
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I have found the generic brand for Adderall is not effective as the brand name. The Epic brand caused me to have severe depression, blurred vision, headaches, very tired and no focus at all.  I’m trying to find a brand that is much like the name brand. Looking for suggestions if anyone can share please. Thanks	1	January 29, 2020	95
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I went to pharmacy to pick up my Adderall generic brand Zydus. I was told they was out of my brand. I was given the Epic brand. The Epic brand caused me to have severe depression and I stayed in bed, I’ve always been very energetic. I stopped taking it. I called the Pharmacist and reported the side effects I had. Pharmacist didn’t act surprised at all, stated we are out of your regular brand and probably won’t get it back in.	1	January 28, 2020	18
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Generics make me feel ill, sometimes headache, sometimes itching or hives.  Google where generics are made.	1	January 24, 2020	45
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	"I was so glad to see these posts.  Pharmacies are so rude to me. I switched to so many brands, but they say they are all alike, and say it doesn't matter which generic I get, because they're all the same.  My doctor, unfortunately, thinks the same.  I finally said to the pharmacy tech one day, ""I'm sure I'm not the only one, who would like certain generics."" She said, no, I'm the only one. I know this sounds crazy, but the blue 10mg of teva, don't seem to work like the 15mg of the peach teva, even if I cut one of the blue in half to make it 15mg."	8	January 23, 2020	90
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I was taking 15mg of generic Adderall  amphetamine / dextroamphetamine  for 3 months and by the end of the 3rd month I had 3 separate people tell me I didn't seem myself. I'm a regularly joyful and excited person but every emotion I had felt muted or stunted while on amphetamine/dextroamphetamine. I stopped talking it and 3 days later felt so much better. I was joyful again! Back to pinging all over the place but at least I'm happy doing it lol. I'm trying Concerta next.	4	January 21, 2020	3
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Ok so I have Both Narcolepsy/Extreme Fatigue & ADD. The generic forms of Adderall (amphetamine and dextroamphetamine) seem to be getting worse and worse. They are making them with obviously cheaper so-called similar ingredients but the new generic amphetamine and dextroamphetamine drugs just have bad side effects and don’t work for me at all or are far less effective. I don’t know if it is Teva brand that is making these cheap ineffective knock-offs that cause migraines & other side effects but they are definitely not working or decent. The generic form Amphetamine Salts works just fine for me but again I think when Teva took over and apparently used far cheaper Ingres there is definitely a disconnect because I don’t think Dextroamp-Amphetamin is a worthy generic form of Adderall but maybe just because Teva brand seems to be using incredibly cheap ingredients,	10	January 20, 2020	21
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Mydayis (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I've had ONE DOSE.  Let me be clear.  I took one 25mg pill 6 hours ago and I'm so sleepy I can't see straight.  I slept 7.5 hours last night so I don't understand the drowsiness.	5	January 9, 2020	33
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’ve been on adderall for a few years now and it was life changing. I’ve always been prescribed a generic and have never had a problem until recently. I noticed that I was not getting the same benefit as I was previously and for months, tried to convince myself that it was in my head and then one month, I noticed everyday that I felt great! Looked at the pill imprint and what do you know - it was a different manufacture (Amneal) than the one I was taking. I started googling it and saw a lot of complaints for generic Adderall from Global Pharmaceutical. I’m talking to pharmacist today about it and requesting the generic by Amneal Pharmaceuticals. I thought they were all the same and it’s a shame that global can make these any less effective than what they should be. Is it so people go to their dr, say they don’t feel the effects of it and get an increase? Sounds like a big pharma thing to do. Trust your gut instinct because you’re the person who knows you best.	1	January 8, 2020	17
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for Narcolepsy	I have #IdiopathicHypersomnia & #narcolepsy. Not all generics are equal  1. #Corepharma works 2. Oval, peach #Teva does not  3. Teva started carrying same dark pink, round IR as #Corepharma  4. In 2018 Teva selling the oval, peach again 5. I filled the Rx with #Sandoz (round, peach) worked almost as well 6. Corepharma was purchased by #Epic.  7. I have been relying on Sandoz since 2018  Every month I have to call pharmacies see if Sandoz is in stock. Usually they don't have it & can't to order it. #JewelOsco is the ONLY pharmacy that places orders for me.   Today (01/05/2020), JewelOsco does not have any &  unable to place an order; the supplier is out & the date available is TBD  Has anyone tried #Northstar? How does it compare to Sandoz?  How is the pharmaceutical industry allowed to do this? If anyone reading this can point me in the direction to hold pharmaceutical companies legally accountable, please comment  *Aurobino does not work for me  #NarcolepsyDiscrimination	9	January 5, 2020	71
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	"I recently was given this new form of adderall from the pharmacy which was circular with just an ""A"" on one side... I did not like this new form of Adderall at all!! I assumed it would have the same effect as the typical oval shaped and it was completely different which is a little scary. It was very bitter and gross tasting unlike the football shaped one has a sweet note. It also disintegrated turning to powder immediately, as I attempted to break it in half (waste of product). I did not get any focus from it nor did I feel any different at all?? It did nothing! Then the next day got a horrible headache! I was talking with a friend who also mentioned getting the same thing recently. He mentioned having an extremely bad headache too the following day, so we now know it's from this form of adderall. I DO NOT LIKE IT. It should be pulled from the market honestly I don't know what the heck this rubbish  is but it is not adderall."	2	January 2, 2020	79
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Was first diagnosed with ADD(inattentive type) by multiple doctors at 18 years old. Out of the gate they prescribed me 60mg IR amphetamine with dextroamphetamine. I am now 26, taking 80mg/day, and have learned a substantial amount about this drug. No it won't make you any smarter or develop hidden talents, most believe this. The generic (dextroamphetamine-amphetamine IR) is cheaper than its brand (Adderall xr.) Obviously brand is set to higher standards of quality than generics, so yes brand name anything works better than generics, it's common sense. If you use it correctly and find the right manufacturer like Teva, you most likely won't find as many negatives as most people.	8	December 30, 2019	9
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I’ve been taking the generic version of Adderall for about 2 years now. I was tired all the time and couldn’t focus. I felt like a slug and when I had energy I still had brain fog, and had a hard time studying. In class, I would fidget in my chair, doodle, and listen to lectures, but nothing would stick in my head. No matter how long I studied.  I was prescribed the 7.5 mg tablet once a day and just the small dose did wonders for my energy levels and let me focus and actually get things done. It helped me talk in social situations and gave me a mood boost.  That being said, The generics changed a couple times. And I’m not sure, but I think I can tell a difference between them. After the pill wears off, my head aches, my legs throb, my body aches, and I’m nauseous and feel sick. I have flu like symptoms, which are miserable. It’s sad because it’s a really small dose and helps me so much but some of the side effects suck. You just gotta see what’s worth it to you.	8	December 24, 2019	61
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Fatigue	"This drug has absolutely saved my life. I have been diagnosed with severe CFS and depression approximately 14 years ago.  In 2015, I had my thyroid removed due to cancer, so I am on artificial thyroid. I could have slept for 20 hours a day and it wouldn't have been enough. I tend not to take it on weekends, as I don't need to be as ""awake"" as when I'm at work. I typically end up sleeping 12-14 hours straight on the days I don't take it. I would not be able to work full-time without Adderall. I have taken 30 mg for several years now and it has worked well for me; I have a hunch that it's because I don't generally take it on weekends, so my body gets that ""mini detox"" from it every week.   Really. This drug has saved my life. I can function again!"	10	December 5, 2019	24
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	This medication does not work at all now.	1	December 2, 2019	49
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for Narcolepsy	I was diagnosed with a sleep disorder/excessive daytime sleepiness and my physician prescribed me Adderall. After I found the dose that worked best for me (30mg in the morning and 10-20mg in the afternoon) I felt like a new person. I usually sleep anywhere from 12-18 hours a day when I don’t have classes or work (I don’t have to force myself up on these days with 2 alarms). I can still nap but they are not nearly as long as they used to be (3-8 hours). My grades have improved and most importantly, my attendance of class has improved! I used to sleep through class, but now I can go because my body isn’t begging for sleep. Overall it is an extremely helpful drug to treat narcolepsy/excessive daytime sleepiness. I finally feel like I have my life back! My only complaint is the dry mouth I experience every so often. I also still feel rather tired some days but it is not as NEAR as torturous as it used to be. Overall, it is extremely helpful and it has changed my life for the better.	10	November 20, 2019	54
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Not very effective; I took a  double dose which cause headaches and made me generally feel ill.  There are  better generics. Company should not be allowed to sell this medication.	1	November 17, 2019	13
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been on Adderal 10 mg for three months now. I have found it helps me so much in the morning. I need to talk to my doctor and see if I can get something for the afternoon. It's been a godsend but I don't have any anger issues just a lot of anxiety. I'm on Xanax as well three times a day and Ambien for sleep which really helps bed by 5 clock I'm wore out. And then my symptoms seem to return. I would recommend this to anyone that has concentration issues. I'm 41 years old and when I went to school they always called you slow. Which always made you look bad. I think my doctor he's wonderful and I'm going to get my Xanax upped and see if I can get something for the afternoon due to that I work many hours a day and I have to be on my toes.	9	November 2, 2019	6
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I got diagnosed with ADHD at the beginning of this school year, being my senior year of high school. Since 8th grade, I've struggled in school, been incredibly impulsive, had very strange eating habits, over-thought everything, and could never contain my anger or anxiety. Once prescribed, my life has changed. My grades went up, and in 3 months I've lost almost 30 pounds (I am still in the normal BMI range). I can control myself. I finally believe in myself because of Adderall.	9	October 29, 2019	79
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Well been on and off Adderall or Ritalin since I was 5. I'm 62 now, and take 60mg XR morning and two 30mg IR in the afternoon. For me it's a Godsend. I can pay attention now,  I'm more sociable, I'm just.......me.	8	October 23, 2019	22
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I’m 48 yo woman that was diagnosed with ADHD in elementary.  When I began (on holiday) taking it I’m extremely fatigue/zombie the first 3 days, I am not nearly as engaged with anyone/anything around me (I talk 97% less when I’m on Adderall) and it makes me feel less cognitive.  I feel like it dumbs me down.  After the 3rd day I start to feel better and those “tranquilizer effects” go away. Adderall is an emotional regulator for me. It works wonders for my impulsivity, racing thoughts, fidgeting, feeling overwhelmed, anger, anxiety, zoning out, and my mouth. Yes, my mouth has always been my biggest challenge and has caused me tremendous social/professional problems.  While in a perfect world I’d be on no medication, I have to recommend Adderall for anyone whose suffering from ADHD, because  it has changed my overall quality of life for the best.  Sparkle on beautiful people! 	9	October 23, 2019	81
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I was diagnosed with both bipolar and ADHD. After trying multiple combinations, we finally tried adderall on top of Wellbutrin, Lamictal, and Fluvoxamine for OCD. At first, the adderall did wonders. Completely made me enjoy life again. However, as my tolerance increased, the adderall crash was very intense. It resulted in a bipolar low almost everyday around the same time. I recently just switched to Stratetta and is my second day taking it. Anxious to see how this works.	9	October 22, 2019	29
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Mydayis (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I’ve been taking meds for ADHD/ADD close to 8 years now.  Tried Adderall at many dosages, types and amount of times per day over a period of many years.  My biggest issue. I forgot to take them.  Tried Vyvanse. It helped but I got nauseous, dizzy every day.  Tried Adderall again and forgot to take them.  One day my doctor mentioned Mydayis. I wouldn’t have to remember taking more than one in the AM.  After a week I could tell that it was helpful but wasn’t able to tell if a BIG difference.  I ran out due to scheduling once & my brain went into hyper drive. I hadn’t felt that chaotic for awhile.  WHILE talking to my doctor she legit wrote out the prescription, handed it to me. ‘go fill it NOW.’ Even had others asking how long I would be without it.  It was clear it helped at that point.  I don’t notice any side effects.  My results with Mydayis are pretty good. No worries of forgetting it, which was the major factor in my switch.	8	October 20, 2019	11
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Mydayis (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I'm making this review one year after trying Mydayis for only a week. I switched to this drug from Adderall IR 20's BID to the 37mg capsule, you don't really think your buzzing, but you indeed are, and more so than with Adderall for the same dose. What prompted me to write this review was that I noticed someone else who reviewed this mentioned that they would be returning the bottle to the pharmacy because they didn't want insurance to think they were keeping it. This is an effect of the drug, I too, even though I bought it on the $5 coupon, did not want the pharmacy (who does not care) to think that I wanted to keep this drug so I returned the remaining 23 capsules to them. It works well, puts you in a different state of mind, and doesn't provide the sense well being of some other ADHD products offer, but it does work better than some generics. Perhaps give this a try if you're on generics that don't work. It is pretty strong, but doesn't feel like it. if that makes sense.	7	October 14, 2019	12
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I was on 10MG XR for 3 months and it worked amazingly. This is a very good medication if you have trouble functioning like a normal person, although be prepared for really dark thoughts if you decide to stop taking it. Withdrawal from this drug is no joke, it can make you want to die...but if you keep taking it or taper off slowly you should be fine.		October 12, 2019	22
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I was diagnosed with ADD in 2005 after experiencing horrible distractibility in class while at college and not being able to focus on a single thought in my head.  I was prescribed Adderall IR and I remember feeling like I had drunk 5 Red Bulls or something!  My heart was pounding and I had horrible anxiety the whole day.  I only took it one time.  I decided to get off it immediately.  Soon after, I was prescribed Strattera, which didn't do ANYTHING.  I've gone for about 13 years without actual ADD medications because I really hated the idea of stimulants.  That all changed when I realized my ADD was getting out of control.  I saw my current psychiatrist last week who re-diagnosed me and we discussed my experiences.  I had read reviews from people here who say that Dexedrine works for them if Adderall made them too wired, so I asked if I could try that.  I just tried it today and I had no horrible side effects - no anxiety, no heart palpitations, no edginess, etc.  It is wonderful!	1	October 9, 2019	21
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for Narcolepsy	I was recently diagnosed with Narcolepsy in early 2019. I was started on Adderrall, but it took about 6 months to get the regimen that worked for me. I was quite sick at the stomach for about 3 months with nausea, and headaches. I take 30 mg at 9 am, and 10 mg at 1 pm. Finally, it's working well to a certain degree.  I still need at least two naps during the day and have most of my energy in the morning and early afternoon. Come 7-8 pm, I'm literally exhausted. I realized how well the medication worked after I missed a dose. I wondered why I was yawning all day and barely able to stay awake. It was because I had forgotten to take my Adderrall. Despite how well it works, I still seem to yawn almost constantly. I would not be able to get through the day without it. It's not 100 percent fix, but I can function for most of the day using it. So, that's a plus for me.	9	October 8, 2019	17
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for Narcolepsy	I was originally prescribed for adult ADD. I took it for several weeks with some results, but I soon learned that it was great for a sleep disorder as well. Recently, I stopped taking it, but soon afterward, all I could do was sleep all day. I was extremely fatigued. I had a blood test for hypothyroidism but it was negative. The only side effect for me was hypertension which I take medication for, but lately, it has been elevated. Nothing the doctor can't fix by increasing the dosage of my blood pressure med. I don't plan to stop this mediation unless I need a larger dosage to work. Currently taking Adderall XR 20mg in the morning and regular Adderall  20mg at noon. Moreover, it helps ease my craving for carbs. It works better than any antidepressant.		October 5, 2019	22
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Mydayis (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I have suffered my entire life with ADD.  For a while Adderal helped. Then as I turned 49 it seemed to make me more anxious, irritable,  short tempered, and I had No patience for stupidity! Upon trying the Mydayis,  I was immediately impressed. I was finishing projects.  Getting things done right! Able to focus for longer durations of time. Long enough to complete tasks at hand. I feel so much better.	10	October 3, 2019	30
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I will never give this to my child again!, I know all children are different but I'm sticking with Dyanavel XR. While he was on Adderall he was acting angry and violent, like he was on some kind of illegal drug, his facial expressions were intense, and he could not sit still, and was very emotional. so I have to give this a 1 star on my personal experience and my son's	1	October 2, 2019	35
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I've had a prescription for amphetamine with dextroamphetamine for  four years, and Teva used to work fairly well for me. Over the last year or so, it's become awful. I know it isn't me, because I still have old (2-3 years) pills laying around; I tried some of them and they work just fine.   Teva changed something in the manufacturing process. The new pills do almost nothing beneficial (I feel sleepy all day), but they have a ton of side effects. I feel very jittery, my stomach hurts, and I've been experiencing bloating.	1	September 30, 2019	23
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Overall, 20 mg Adderall XR for ADHD helps me to focus. The problem with adderall is it makes me sweat something awful. Anyone else annoyed with sweating while taking adderall?	9	September 28, 2019	62
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Well first off. Adderall is an Amphetamine  which assist with the production of dopamine. Very close  relation to meth. I am 21 years old and I started Adderall again. Previously I was on Adderall from age 8-13 and it worked great. Some say ADHD is not real and it just a symptom of bad health etc... I have been very very healthy and unhealthy which produced no changed in brain fog. Now that engineering is my main task in like I seem to have a hefty amount of brain fog. Adderall does in fact help with focus but the downside is the extreme crashes that happen when you stop taking it.	8	September 26, 2019	20
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been on Adderall for quite sometime. It has helped me focus and also being proactive. I recently got a new script and diff manufacturing teva  I noticed since I have taken it I'm extremely tired. Cannot focus at all I feel like a scatter brain..I had to call my dr to have him rewrite a new script and surrender the Teva (amphetamine with dextroamphetamine) Did anyone get the same reaction?	1	September 26, 2019	20
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I shared my experience recently on here and was going back over and reading others as well.  I believe we should all state the laboratory that producing the specific generic we are each taking. Doing so may help us all narrow down which ones to stay away from and which ones are truly therapeutic.  Eon lab  brand of amphetamine/dextroamphetamine was good until 9 months ago, now they are horrible (no therapeutic value and bad side effects).  I then I switched to Teva and they were decent for about 2 months and now they are giving me side effects.  Plus the pharmacy ran out of them and I had to wait for a new batch and when the new batch came in is when the bad side effect started.  I KNOW the drug manufacturer has changed something.

ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Narcolepsy	I have been on generic Adderall (dextroamphetamine -amphetamine) for about a year and a half. I have always got the Teva brand with no issues. But in the last couple months I have noticed it not working as well. I just filled my script last week and they are even worse! I keep dozing off at work and back to taking naps in my car on lunch again. It's very frustrating! I take 30mg twice a day for narcolepsy. Last month during to the shortage on 30mg my script was shorted by 9 pills. This time the manufacturer was Alvogen and they were amazing! Only time I came across this manufacturer. I wish my insurance would cover the brand name. They denied me even with my doctor's appeal.	1	September 23, 2019	9
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for Narcolepsy	I have been on D-Amphetamine Salt Combo, 30mg a day for a few months for narcolepsy and actually did great. But I recently picked up another prescription and noticed this brand is called Teva generic brand. I have noticed for 2 weeks I have became irritated, forgetting easily in what I was looking for or talking about, aggressive outbursts, stomach pain, migraines, generalist not feeling good on this brand. I will be complaining over this!	1	September 15, 2019	50
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	So, I have had ADHD since I was like young. I never liked the pills they gave me when I was younger because I was already a thin kid and then taking Adderall I would eat even less. So I stopped taking the medication. When I was taking this medication I got most improved student! I went without the drug for years, until just about 2 years ago I started taking it again and It has helped me so much! I am very thankful for this drug. I suffer from fatigue , and many, many other problems. This drug is one of many I NEED, To Think Straight and to not get outta control.  It also helps me BIG TIME with my anger issues. Hope this helps someone! Star Kid Is OUT!	9	September 11, 2019	47
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	This drug is one of the greatest formulas of all time. I went from down and depressed and unmotivated to organized and focused. Also from relatively poor to rich due the effect it had on me with my enthusiasm for work	10	September 11, 2019	57
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I cannot believe that the FDA allows AUROBINDO or TEVA to sale their lousy drugs through pharmacies in the US.  Neither of these generics have any affect on me at all!!  WASTE of money!   They are playing with people's minds and well being!!!!	2	September 6, 2019	109
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Have taken Adderall on and off for around 13 years for ADD and CFS. I was lucky enough to have tried the “real” brand Adderall by Barr laboratories. I’ve never taken over 20mg a day. This medicine has gone to TRASH.The only negative side affect from the Barr version was occasional jaw clinching.   I think Teva must’ve burned the patent formula or something because it has never worked liked the Barr, not even close.  So many negative side effects (migraine headaches, heartburn, nausea)! I keep hoping at some point they might magically start producing a decent version that actually helps instead of hurts.  The original Barr had true therapeutic value.  Eon labs produced a decent generic for a while, but BAM, it suddenly went to garbage at the end of 2018.  So switched back to Teva a couple months back and it started ok( not as good as Eon but better than everything else out there), then last months refill is feeling like they’re changing to something bad too.  Bring back real Adderall!	3	September 4, 2019	78
ACT Amphetamine XR -  20MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I had taken Adderall for many years and was slowly on the decline.  I was deeply depressed and had an absolute hopeless and helpless outlook on life with no relief. I had psychosis, delusions and impulsive behavior which I never had. I began having issues with memory, thinking, reasoning, decision making, tasks, and  concentration.  I would become very agitated if being interrupted. I was very aggressive and agitated constantly, it was at least 98% of the time in 10 years.  I read horror stories about stimulants, namely the Amphetamine line of them. I subsequently tapered off of them and feel 100% better than before. I have no depressive symptoms, delusions, memory problems, agitation or aggressiveness. I was not happy with life and my personal relationships were very toxic. I wasted almost 10 years of my life feeling like this and have other personal complications that resulted from the use of these toxic drugs.	1	August 28, 2019	29
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I have taken Adderall XR and short acting for 25 years and I got this new XR 30MG the other day Lannett and it made me tired, heart racing, BP accelerated and did NOTHING to help me focus. I contacted the pharmacy and my Dr and he's trying to switch me to another brand because this is a joke. awful..	1	April 26, 2021	3
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Just started taking adderall XR 10mg after learning I had been mis-diagnosed for 15+ years as either bi-polar, major depressive disorder and social anxiety. I finally found a psychiatrist that really dug deep and concluded I was not bi polar but I suffered from adult ADHD (33 year old male). It makes total sense as I read more about ADHD. I had been on every possible anti-depressant, anti psychotic MDD etc and was just done with meds. I was diagnosed as a child and teen but thought “ I’d grow out of it” and apparently never did it just got worse. I feel that so many people are mis-diagnosed it’s almost unbelievable. My theory and the doctor also said that if you take the medication and it calms you and your racing thoughts that that’s a tell tail sign that you do indeed suffer from ADHD, it’s not just a childhood/school era problem, it disrupts your life, marriage everything. I’m on day 2 and it’s like a light switch has been turned on and I can relax and not be manic.	9	April 25, 2021	3
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been on and off generic Adderall for many years. Currently, I have been prescribed 30 mg twice a day. For the last couple of months, it's been a nightmare. It's been on backorder and then changed the generic name from amphetamine salts combo to amphetamine/ dextroamphetamine combo. This is only because I have had severe headaches, extreme fatigue, and a loss of motivation. My ADHD has been out of the roof. It's frustrating because I feel like I did before taking any generic Adderall. I have even been concerned that maybe I was receiving a placebo rather than the actual medication. That's probably far-fetched, but it's been such a decline for me. There is something missing from this generic form and it is the essential thing that is needed to control my ADHD. I have even gained a lot of weight over the past two months. Hopefully, something will give, I can't imagine it affecting people like this and nothing changing.	3	April 19, 2021	8
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	This pill does not work like any Adderall that I have experienced. There is neither the focus or the energy bump that is typically associated with the two most therapeutic aspects of the formulation. The vast majority of time I feel equally as sleepy and unfocused as I did when I took it.    I am an experienced user of this positive life-changing medication. The patients that us this medication are in a bad position when company’s that make inferior generic medications are allowed distribution rights through equally as corrupt retail pharmaceutical outlets seeking to make a few pennies extra per script, on the back of patients whose experienced opinion is rarely considered.	2	April 17, 2021	2
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I have taken ADHD meds many years. Adderall XR is the ADHD med that works the best for me. I am taking a generic manufactured by Lannett. It by far has worked the best for me with the reason(s) being is the smoothness, the come up is very quick, and it does it's job perfectly.   To reiterate, Lannett is very smooth with a quick come up, and last long enough most days.	9	April 15, 2021	4
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	If anyone else is having a terrible time with the new Lannett generic adderall you can report this to the FDA.  I have been having crippling headaches, stomach aches, and the medication doesn’t even feel like it works!!! I get tired after I take it and then can’t sleep all night because of it. HORRIBLE. Google fda medwatch online reporting to fill in the form	1	April 9, 2021	33
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Right now I take 50mg Lamictal for my Bipolar and 7.5mg twice a day Adderall for ADHD. At first I wasn't sure Adderall was going to work for me, I was initially prescribed 20mg twice a day.  That dose ended up being way too high for me, It made be become manic and I felt really wired all the time.  I now take 7.5mg twice a day and have found it to be much better. I feel alert and focused throughout the day.  Some of the side effects I have had are weight loss, jaw clenching, and mild insomnia (I usually just take melatonin). Overall, Adderall has helped me a lot, I just had to find the right dosage.	8	April 8, 2021	0
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been on Adderall for several years and the Sandoz brand is TOXIC and HORRIBLE! At first it is like a sugar pill no effect and then dizziness, headache, feeling more confused, spaced out and mind blank, extreme fatigue. I can't believe this is on the market. FDA honestly needs to step up their game and monitor the generics. It is a up and down roller coaster with different manufactures each month. This is insane. They are robbing us blind in the pharmaceutical business. They give us something toxic or a placebo. What is happening to the medications now. Please do not take the Sandoz. Read the court documents about reviews on them and they came from the company. Making themselves sound great as a pretend customer!! I can not believe how bad this medication from this manufacture is.	1	April 6, 2021	10
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Worked really well for the first week or so, but then really made me more irritable and gave me uncontrollable suicidal urges that ultimately sent me to the hospital. The suicidal urges stopped after dropping the medication.  I wouldn't recommend against the medication, I would just proceed with caution as the side effects can vary in intensity from person to person.	1	April 3, 2021	3
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I have been prescribed Amphetamine Salt Combo which has worked well(I have ADD and narcolepsy). Today I was given from RX, Amphetamine Aspertate, it make me fell kinda sickness. Was I given the wrong medicine. The prescription has not changed ?	7	April 1, 2021	3
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I’ve been on Adderrall immediate release for at least 8 years, probably more. At first Adderrall gave me an intense high and made me very talkative. Very talkative. That lasted for a few days and after that each morning when I took it it gave me a euphoric feeling for about have the day. I wasn’t making impulsive decisions like I had in the past and my focus was razor sharp. I really enjoyed this drug for sometime but the last 3-5 years it’s just been the same old same old. I take it in the morning and have somewhat of a boost in energy and focus but after around 11am the effects of the medication just wears off. I wind up feeling irritable, decent level of focus if I’m busy at work, and just downright not very social with people. This week I’m going to see my P.A. and hopefully get on Vyvanse which I was encouraged by many to try before jumping on Adderrall. Vyvanse is more expensive but I’m ready to feel more focused and more myself.	5	March 28, 2021	4
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	This review is for generic Adderall XR - amphetamine/dextroamphetamine. I've experienced wildly different effects from different manufacturers. Some days it didn't work. Some days it worked great. But I got severe debilitating headaches that lasted 24/7 and didn't go away using ibuprofen. Went to neurologist and got an MRI. If I could push past the side effects it did work well but for only about 4-5 hours after kicking in (which took about an hour). Needed a booster of IR in the afternoon, so eventually I couldn't deal with the headaches and switched to IR completely. Headaches gone almost immediately. I still get them with IR but not anywhere near as often or as bad.	6	March 23, 2021	1
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	Mydayis (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	"I've tried several ADHD meds and Mydayis has definitely been the best for me. I'm on the lowest dose and it starts working 20-30 minutes after I take it. I'm then able to be productive and direct my focus easily, compared to other meds (eg-Adderall) which gave me a burst of intense focus that I had no control over. The transitions are barely noticeable and it really helps maintain consistent energy levels. After wearing off, it's a very natural ""I've worked all day and now I'm ready to relax before bed"" feeling (no crash). I also noticed it significantly helps manage my depression-something no other ADHD med has done. The only downsides: (1) it does reduce my appetite a lot and (2) it only lasts about 9-10 hours on my current dose (12.5mg), but higher doses (25mg+) give me headaches. It's not perfect, but the positives definitely outweigh the negatives for me. Lastly-you don't know how it'll affect you, so don't let reviews scare you away if you/your doc think it might help."	9	March 21, 2021	4
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I was diagnosed with ADHD at age 17 and only really started taking stimulant medication after I had turned 20 last year. I was originally trying out varying doses of IR but started trying XR in the past few months.  Overall: Hit or miss for me. It does help with my focus, but the side effects and how much it helps varies pretty drastically depending on the day. Biggest side effects are dehydration, lack of appetite, potentially crashing at night (normal). I also feel a bit uncomfortable sometimes (anxiety-ish twitchy feeling) but that's not very common.  The mallinckrodt brand I was switched to recently seems maybe a bit more hit or miss honestly I can't really tell that much of a difference (unlike people on opioids who swear that mallinckrodt is awful). I'm on 25mg for now and I'm gonna keep seeing how I feel in the coming weeks. Helps with ADHD no doubt, but do be weary of the side effects.	7	March 16, 2021	2
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	Mydayis (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I took Mydayis 37.5 mg for 2 years. I just recently ran out and decided to wait a week to refill. I cannot believe the change in myself! While on it I became withdrawn and too focused on 1 specific thing. I cut out people and ruined my small business. I didn't feel human! I can't explain the feeling but now that I haven't taken it in a week I feel like myself again! I was just flesh living day by day on mydayis! I will NEVER touch it again! Please tell me there's others out there with similar experiences	1	March 12, 2021	5
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	"I have been taking teva 20mg adderall from 06-19 when they disappeared. I had already suffered from side effects from other generics due to CVS giving me a different generic a few times without consent or being informed. I did the whole google wormhole for a few months before finally seeing a random comment about ""INACTIVE"" ingredients and how this person suffered terrible side effects across multiple generic medications with this same ""INACTIVE"" ingredient. Being on multiple meds myself and having autoimmune and neuro disorders it affected my mental health knowing something wasn't right and just not grasping why & not understanding. That random comment changed everything for me ""INACTIVE"" does not equal no effect.  Teva not being an option then and now not at all I use Mallinckrodt and Arubindo 20 mg. I find it helps to switch them every couple months or I take M in the morning and A in the afternoon depending on how my body is functioning. I tried SAndoz that was terrible side effects."	8	March 6, 2021	2
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	Narcolepsy	I've been on adderall 20 mg 3× a day for over 10 years from secondary narcolepsy due to a TBI. I will only take Teva there plenty of generics that don't work and are less than a 10% out of 100% I got these I think Mallinckrodt U30 on it I tried returning it after taking 3 and falling asleep they wouldn't return so I took about 7 more just to get home from the pharmacy 1hour drive without passing out it did nothing. If I took 4 Teva I'd bounce off the walls won't sleep for at least 1 day. I will never again take anything besides the Teva after sleeping for the remainder of the month. I wish I could afford the brand name. Don't listen to any pharmacist generic aren't close I can't believe they get away with saying there same as brand lol body doesn't lie. Scumbags looking for profit due not caring who suffers	9	March 5, 2021	5
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	My 7 year old son is a first grader and was recently diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. He has been recommended Adderall for this but I am a bit reluctant to initiate its usage. I have a few reservations about how long it lasts in our system which I have heard can prove to be dangerous for a young kid. I have read multiple articles like these, but I am still not so sure. Seeing the number of experienced people here, please tell me if I should continue with it.		March 4, 2021	4
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	First time taking Alvogen generic amphetamine with dextroamphetamine 30mg. Been taking adderall for 2 years but always Teva generic. Oh my God, the Alvogen brand has made me feel so sick. All over severe headache, nauseous, vomiting, diarrhea. I feel awful. No focus, no energy, can't keep anything down, running to the bathroom.	1	February 27, 2021	8
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Been taking adderall for years. Until the had me try a white stop sign shaped one by mallinckrodt since there was an adderall shortage at my Walgreens. mallinckrodt amphetamine/dextroamphetamine shouldn’t even be labeled as amphetamine/dextroamphetamine it should just be sold as a caffeine pill because all it does is wake you up subtlety. It doesn’t help with focus whatsoever. I’ve already filed a complaint with the FDA and recommend everyone else do the same	1	February 25, 2021	20
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I take the 10 mg amphetamine with dextroamphetamine by Teva and it works great, better than the 15 mg.in my opinion. I see others mentioning generics by Alogen and Mallinckrodt here. Well I take a couple of other medications manufactured by these 2, on and off, most times it's Mallickrodt. Let me tell you, this is the WORST drug manufacturer on the market. The Alogen is junk too. I've been on a few medical chat sites just to see what I can find out about Mallinckrodt and see if others felt the same way and they absolutely do! Literally 100's of people have complained to the co. itself and to the FDA. This has been going on for a solid 5 years at least & the stuff is STILL pure unadulterated JUNK.	7	February 21, 2021	23
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	Mydayis (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Switched from Concerta to Mydayis for the longer duration mechanism Mydayis offers. Was started on 25mg of Mydayis. ADD symptoms improved but I experienced dry mouth, dizziness, heart increase, and appetite decrease which subsided after the first week. Second week I felt like the dose was not effective. Doc switched me to 37.5mg of the mydayis and so far symptoms of ADD improved but side effects are rough. Dry mouth, headache, dizziness, lack of appetite, increased anxiety. I’m on day 4 or 5 so hoping the side effects subside when my body adjusts to the higher dose... fingers crossed.	6	February 20, 2021	4
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I am currently on Adderall XR 30MG, and it has changed so many different aspects of my life, including depression.  I was prescribed Adderall because I was about to be terminated from my job. Back to the drug, I take it around 6am everyday, and found that my overall mood has changed. I am not as emotional as I was before, yet I am still able to express my feelings when necessary without the full breakdowns. I have been dealing with Major Depressive Disorder, and this medication has alleviated most of those feelings.  However, the medication has not been a miracle drug, and it contains no magic! For me, ADD has always been there. For me, it took me to be 36 years old to finally realize it was time to visit a psychiatrist, regardless of all the negative stigmas; I was glad I did, because it gave me many suspected answers, rather than self diagnosing situations.	9	February 15, 2021	17
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’ve taken adderall for years. I used to be on Lannett brand and Walgreens recently switched to TEVA. I had my script switched from CVS to Walgreens because it was closer to me. I have been on it for 3 months and the side effects are TERRIBLE.  I clench my teeth so bad my teeth have broken, I am severely depressed, I can’t find happiness in literally anything. I don’t feel motivated at all. If anything I feel less motivated to get out of bed. My skin is dry, my eyes are sinking in and I get terrible migraines. My anxiety is so bad I’m anti social, and I thought I had a stroke because of side effects. I’m 25. Just don’t take it		February 13, 2021	7
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I take two 30 mg pills a day for ADHD and it has really made a huge difference in my life. I am able to focus on one task at a time and complete it. Works great for giving me the motivation I sometimes lack. Only issue is that when I was given the white or peach ones, they did not seem to work as well as the pink ones. Talked to doctor about it and she added to my prescription to only receive the pink ones. Curious if anyone else has had this issue	9	February 10, 2021	34
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	ALVOGEN INC has got me all messed up. I've taken ADHD meds since 1st grade and I'm 32 now so I'm very confident in my ability to distinguish between generics that work & don't and why. For the past 4 years I've used the same CVS location to fill my Adderall tab 30mg generic the past two times though I received a pill that looked different thinking okay whatever this happens from time to time it is just a different manufacturer no big deal. I was wrong. I have had insanely high blood pressure increases, trouble sleeping, hardly any focus, SEVERE anxiety like where is feel like I can't breathe suddenly especially when I try to sleep, shaky hands, VERY noticeable heart palpitations, diarrhea, headaches and  weird emotional ups & downs. I've been vegan for 3 months now at first I was seeing a steady decrease in blood pressure but as soon as I started taking this new generic I'm topping out at 161/111 at the doctor a few days ago which is just absolutely bonkers and terrifying	2	February 9, 2021	9
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’ve taken TEVA adderall 20 mg IR for the past 2+ years. It worked greatly for my ADD & as an anti-depressant. HOWEVER, it has changed! Starting July 2020, the TEVA tablet was completely different. It was no longer sweet, the consistency was harder & the efficacy was compromised. I can take it & fall asleep hours later & there is ZERO anti-depressant effect. In fact, it deepens my depression.  I will submit a report to the FDA & I encourage everyone else to. Also, please research the complaints of TEVAs other generics. I’m not sure what to try next. I tried the Sandoz and it was actually worse. I received the hideous Zydus once-which gave me a migraine & intensely aching back.I believe it’s manufactured out of this country.  This experience has made me question ALL generic medications.   Please start researching yours & refuse to take these.  I tried switching to name brands but my ins. refuses to pay.	2	February 8, 2021	11
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Have used a generic for about 6 years now worked for me except it has turned me into a teeth grinder I do it all the time and now my teeth are worn to the point they are ruined.  My doctor said he never heard of that side effect but a recent visit to a dentist to try to fix my teeth I was told they see this all the time and this grinding may never go away. I need to find something that works without these side effects	6	February 4, 2021	9
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine)	My cardiologist who diagnosed me with dysautonomia prescribed me adderall in high school because my symptoms included extreme fatigue, brain fog, and *bad* orthostatic hypotension. He did not warn me about all the side effects I would experience (due partly to the fact that I do not have ADHD), and I was given a high dose to start. It did help with my fatigue and immensely improved my focus (can’t complain there, I was *hyper* focused), brain fog, and hypotension, but there were some questionable side effects I experienced for the almost 2 years I took it: complete lack of appetite, significant weight loss, resting tachycardia and angina (my dysautonomia makes my HR very high to begin with) Overall it definitely improved my quality of life for a time but it seems like a questionable Rx for people with this condition who are hyper adrenal, already experiencing an overactive sympathetic ANS, and have a high HR due to the cardio effects.	7	January 27, 2021	3
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I’ve been in this medication for almost a year . And it change my life in good way.

ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been taking Teva amphetamine/dextroamphetamine (adderall generic) for quite sometime for ADHD. In the last year, I noticed right away something was off. First was the obvious color. The Teva that has always worked for me with no problems (that was being weaned out in 2019) was as follows..  peach color and sweet, easy to swallow and not gag on. Teva now, is orange. The sweet taste that made it bearable to take has changed completely. My focus, clarity, motivation, and concentration has been/is immensely effected by the new ingredient change. (I don't have it at all)  My overall mental health, has declined quickly. It has caused my mood to completely change, headaches are constant, and upset stomach. All of this, and they don't even work. I struggle everyday now. Less main ingredient and more fillers means more pills can be produced, which means more money in the manufacturer's pocket..... Mental health should be top priority, especially being consistent with and not changing the ingredients.	1	January 17, 2021	50
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	This month is the first time I received sandoz adderall ER and it doesn't seem to work very well for me. Mallinckrodt doesn't seem to work too well for me either. I think Teva seems to work the best for me; even better than the name brand for adderall.	6	January 17, 2021	2
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I have suffered with ADHD since I was a young kid, I got diagnosed at the youngest age possible and I never got any help for it by my old doctor.  With my new doctor, he gave me Adderall XR to start out with 10 and than up it to 20 within a week if not effective.   I am on 20 MG now and it has changed my life, I failed school and life because I couldn't pay attention and now not only can I pay attention but this has also helped as my ADHD had caused Depression/Anxiety also OCD.	10	January 15, 2021	14
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Generic Adderall varies significantly depending on mfg. Reason being, the FDA says the mfg only has to “demonstrate” it “works in the same way “ as the brand-name. i.e. generic ingredients do  Not have to be same which is why so many don’t work and/or make people feel sick. My experience, the only generic that works like the brand-name is Prasco, which acquired Teva’s generic xr in 2016.  Few pharmacies use Prasco as their generic because it’s more expensive!  My Dr specifies “Prasco generic only” on my prescription for D-Amphetamine ER 30MG Salt combo. By law, the pharmacy must comply if Prasco is one of their overall suppliers. My insurance changed so I called Prasco to see if they sell to Costco. They do. Just takes a day or 2 for the pharmacist to order and fill my script. Walgreens used Prasco as their generic until recently. Now it’s Mallinckrodt which just filed for bankruptcy to settle a slew of opioid lawsuits. It’s all about $		January 8, 2021	59
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	The adderall name brand is 2-3 times better than generic adderall XR. The FDA should be inspecting these generic companies and make sure they are getting as high of quality ingredients. I urge anyone in generics to try real adderall for a month then decided for yourself. Decide to report the generics because we should be able to get a cheaper still 90$ for generic compared to $220+ for name brand.	10	January 7, 2021	18
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’m a doctor with ADHD. I’ve been on the generics to cut costs during tough times but I insist on the name brand adderall. No only is it smoother it lasts longer and helps even more than the generics. It’s a shame that cost is a bearing on necessary prescriptions and that generic are so much weaker and poorer quality. Generic adderall needs to step it up they have quality issues and their recipe is somehow flawed.	5	January 7, 2021	25
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for Narcolepsy	I was diagnosed with a severe case of narcolepsy about a year ago. I always thought it was my chronic fatigue that made me feel so sleepy all the time. I was finally referred to a sleep specialist who ordered a night and day time sleep study. When I received the results he told me I was a very sleepy person, his worst case in many years. I have been taking 20MG Adderall 3x a day. It does help but I'm still extremely tired throughout the day. The sleep doctor advised me in September that there's a newer medication that can be added to my Adderall but insurance didn't like to approve it and that in 6 months hopefully it will be easier to prescribe. I've seen somewhere that 60MG a day is the max for treating ADHD but that 90MG is the max for treating narcolepsy. I'm curious if that dose would improve my symptoms. Overall I'm happy with the medication as I never notice any side effects. I just want to feel more awake and less sleepy.	7	January 6, 2021	9
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)		Alvo Adderall sucks. It doesn’t work at all. I'm so annoyed that  my month will suck while taking this brand	1	January 4, 2021	4
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	Mydayis (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I've only been taking it for 3 days but I can understand now when people say they feel it running in the background. So far no side effects other than appetite loss. I do feel energy from this but not like Adderall there's no anxiety tied to the energy its more like motivation than energy. One thing I've noticed is I like to always be doing something that is productive in some way. It's not the type of energy you get and use to dance or workout you feel driven to get things done.  It last for the whole 16 hours which surprised me I'm an ultra rapid metabolizer. I have no crash on this like I did with Adderall. I'm just waiting for my period now to see how the cramps are and giving the medicine more time to see if I do have any side effects, so far none but no appetite.	10	January 3, 2021	11
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I've been taking dextroamp-amphet ER 15mg once a day for roughly 3 months now and it's helped me greatly until 2 weeks ago and it's as if I cut my dose by 3/4! Is this normal and what dose, frequency, and type of adderall should I change to? I've heard about generic vs name brand, so what do the best ones look like?	6	December 30, 2020	1
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I've been prescribed adderall for 10yrs+ and without it mentally and physically I would be worse. I do have soreness, achy body, etc but have other health problems. Adderall has ROTTED MY TEETH OUT. Being 42 years old, fear ability to retain with out medicine as I age. I have severe withdrawal, to include extreme fatigue, severe constipation. I need the Adderral and helps some as without it life would be more difficult. All and all I would not manage without it very well but it is less effective as been taking for years. Take care and God Bless All. Be Safe!	7	December 24, 2020	10
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	Narcolepsy	I take the regular Adderall 20mg in the morning, but do 10mg in the afternoon; along with my other prescribed stimulants since mornings are the hardest for me. I got a new prescription and after a couple days of feeling like complete rubbish and having unscheduled naps each day, I noticed it was different.   After having the name brand and suddenly switching to this generic; it made sense why I suddenly felt like I could never wake up, even on 480mg of stimulants each day. Even as I write this at almost 11pm, I have felt like I can't do anything but lay down and nod off throughout the day.  These generics are different and affect our quality of life. When your treatment works and suddenly you feel like you aren't even taking your medicine because of a sudden switch to a placebo-like generic is a huge problem.  Where is the consistency for these medications!?	1	November 30, 2020	25
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for Narcolepsy	Adderall worked well for a year then it wore off even with medication free holidays. When trying a new medication and stopping I didn’t realize how out of breath it was making me, I thought it was because I was fat.	3	November 25, 2020	7
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	Fatigue	I just tried Alvogen brand of amphetamine/dextroamphetamine this month because my pharmacy. It is absolutely awful. I feel like my body is screaming, absolutely doesn’t help with energy or attention. Just increases anxiety. And I’m extremely lethargic. I strongly recommend against them.	1	November 25, 2020	27
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Regarding the post by DrKatz on 11/7/2020:.  I too take the 20 mg salt combo- manufactured by Teva, and have been on that specific brand for two and a half years.  I can definitely concur that something has changed with their product.   I am on a prescription of 80 mg a day and I too noticed a difference in taste, consistency of the pill itself, and it not working as well as it used to.  I am aware of a recall May 22nd by Teva for a few of their doses- the 20mg pill being one of them.   Thinking placebo, I inspected the pill closely: the depression level of the imprint is different, slight change in the oblong shape, the edging* (*like the cut/side profile of floor boards) and thickness + curvature.   The taste difference (bitter) I noticed in August. October back to normal but currently (Nov.) the taste changed again- however this time with a much greater chemical profile- like bactine or rubbing alcohol, more crumbly and not working as well for either my ADHD or narcolepsy.	8	November 15, 2020	29
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I’ve been on Adderall XR 20 mg since October 6th 2020. I have to say this medication is life changing and your psychiatrist, doctor or whatever will try and find the right dosage for you. I’m 22 years old, Male and I noticed the medication working within an hour, I’m about 220 pounds 5’8 and despite that it still kicked in relatively fast. The side affects I notice the most are as follows dry mouth, appetite suppression, some irritability, and insomnia on occasion. Adderall XR for me last anywhere from 8-12 hours, if it wears off the medical professional in most cases will add Adderall IR to take in the afternoon, since upping the dose of XR will not increase duration only the intensity of the medication itself. ADHD medication is all about finding what’s right for YOU, don’t give up if it doesn’t get manageable or fixed after the first try.	9	November 8, 2020	41
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have always used Teva Adderall IR because I have had horrible experiences with other generic, including inconsistency and lack of potency.  Understand that I have taken Teva Adderall 20MG tablets over five years, thus it would less difficult for someone like me to detect subtle changes in its effects.  I have noticed the following, and this started around September 2020.  Teva generic Adderall tablets seem (and this is very subtle) smaller in size. Second: Teva is known for its slight sweet taste. It is almost as if that is completely  gone... I’m certainly not saying that added anything to it, but I’m saying it’s an indicator  of some sort of formula change.  Finally, although the 20MG tablet is small, it used to be easy to half the tablet. Recently they just crumble. To summarize, I have also noted a very marked decrease in efficacy.	7	November 7, 2020	26
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Adderall XR is Life changing (positively). I went from being massively distractable and procrastinate constantly to getting things done. I'm not just referring to school work or office work. I mean just showing up on time to meet up with friends. Not getting instantly bored with family.  I truly love it!   --- Quick warning, take it as your doctor recommends! So much of the bad press comes from people abusing the drug.  Likewise, if you're able, take a day off now and then. Perhaps on days when you don't need to work or do much. It's sort of like coffee/tea/caffeine in that sense. Fine if you do take it everyday, but probably best if you give your mind/body a rest from it now & then.  Just like running or exercise, you need light or rest days each week to really get the most from the workout.	10	November 6, 2020	33
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	My grades instantly went from the 60s and 70s to 90s and 100s and for once I felt like I had control over my life. The side effects were pretty bad and inconsistent though, so I had to go from 20 to 15 mg.	9	November 4, 2020	18
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine)	My son had been on every ADHD meds made by mankind since he was 5. He is 17 now, and because I go read reviews after the doctor changes his meds. I thought it might help someone who has went through all of them also. Adderall was the worst . My son was happy, enteric, easy go lucky and even on daytrana.  Ritalin, foculian, etc. he never lost himself. On adderall he was drowning mentally. Depression set in, moodiness, anger, punching walls, so mad he would black out, etc. Be very careful !!!!! Do not choose this one if you but all help it!	1	October 26, 2020	9
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	The Adderal dose my doctor prescribed didn't seem to work that great(20 mg twice a day)  One day I had it after my oatmeal and it was more effective so after that I just scrunched up the pill like I did with oatmeal, but I didn't put it on anything.  I just took it like that. Works great!  Much more motivation to get tasks done so I can finish more!  Maybe you could try that if it sees not enough to work.  I use Sandoz.	10	October 11, 2020	20
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for Narcolepsy	I was switched to Adderall but after 2 years switched to Ritalin. Adderall seems to open up parts of your brain best left closed. I started to see a 12 year old boy in the yard during the day he would be gone when I went to talk with him. My neighbors told me that in the 1970s he died here. You have to watch the dosage	10	October 10, 2020	26
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for Narcolepsy	I have been soooo sleepy for the past 15 years of my life. I finally found a PA that listened to me about my sleepiness. She has been great. I can not afford the recommended sleep study. I am currently taking 10mg extended release. It has helped but I am still falling asleep at work. My PA will meet with me in after a month on it. I’m not sure if I need an increased dosage or if it’s not working on me. It’s a struggle still. I don’t want to feel hopeless that I can’t find help.	6	October 9, 2020	11
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Adderall XR was originally prescribed to me for ADD, but it worked best as a terrific antidepressant.  However, now that I've been on it for 20 straight years at 40-80 mg. Daily, it has very little antidepressant effect now. It's Adderall burnout -- apparently it strips the brain of dopamine -- the feel-good hormone.        I still have to take it just to do anything at all each day.  The worst effect is insomnia -- no matter how early I take it.  It keeps me up for 24 hours unless I finally have to take Seroquel for sleep.  Seroquel is the only thing that will knock out Adderall XR.  But I hate it because it makes me so damn sluggish in the morning, awful.        I cannot believe it's 2020, and there is still no decent antidep medication available,	8	October 1, 2020	31
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	The last 9 months generic “Zydus” was the only brand of amphetamine/dextroamphetamine available in my area. I noticed pretty nasty side effects beginning 45 minutes after consumption. I’ve never felt depression so severely before taking Zydus. Teva/Barr has returned. Felt a night and day difference the first day. Hope Zydus gets banned for the safety of us all.	1	September 23, 2020	20

ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	Mydayis (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I switched over to Mydayis in hope of finding something that could last the entire day. My days are usually nonstop for approx 16 hours. I started at the lowest dose and went up to the 50mg after 3 weeks. Gave it a few more weeks in hopes that it would work like how we wanted it to. The negative side effects outweigh the positives. The first thing I noticed was ejaculatory anhedonia. It led to an unplanned pregnancy before I caught it. The rest included falling behind in classes and not being able to keep up at work. Felt lazy and not wanting to do anything. It was like being unmedicated all over again!	4	September 21, 2020	8
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine)	I am so confused but feeling better just knowing I am not alone. I am very sensitive to any changes in medication. I have been on 10 mg twice daily for about 10 months. The pharmacy has switched generic brands multiple times. I did well on one made by Sun Industries but am not doing well on Teva. Apparently they make the name brand which I didn’t know until tonight. I would also like to know how we can change the way generics are approved. The variations are laughable and can really cause problems. I’m hesitant to switch to a different generic because what always happens is they stop making it or the pharmacy can’t get it. I requested name brand so at least it’s consistent. Any suggestions? So frustrated! Best to you all.	7	September 21, 2020	41
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for Narcolepsy	This medicine is god send. I have been suffering with narcolepsy for about 5 years. Had no idea what I was doing wrong that I cannot keep my eye open. I am talking about sleeping for 8-9 hours and then waking up and wanting to go back to sleep. I am a public school teacher and I had no choice but to be at work all day. That was a struggle and I was embarrassed to even tell my coworkers. This summer, so many unpleasant events happened in my life, I decided to talk to my psychiatrist about unable to concentrate and the excessive sleeping pattern. He wanted me to try adderall and bam!! I haven’t taken a nap since August . I do not have any side effects, not glittery, no overworking , nothing. Just ready to start the day and get in with my life. I usually go to bed around 9:30pm and sleeps well. I take 20 mg twice a day. But if you miss a dose, back to square one. I am religiously on a schedule and take them at the same time everyday. I am in my mid 40’s.	10	September 17, 2020	38
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Generic Adderall:  TEVA vs. ALVOGEN “All generic adderall is NOT the same trust me!...... I don’t care what your physician or pharmacist may say.“  I’ve taken Adderall for nearly 25 plus years for ADD.  WHY? it works twice as good ask anyone whose taken different brands before. For the BEST quality and most potent adderall on the market is made by a company called TEVA.  Even pharmacist tell me when they run out of TEVA and must use ALVOGEN their patients complain because the pharmacies cannot keep TEVA in stock because the consumers know it’s the best and most effective for ADD and ADHD.	1	September 15, 2020	131
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have taken both Adderall and its generic(amphetamine/dextroamphetamine) for over 16 years for my Adult Attention Deficit Disorder. I have found that the original Adderall has the best effectiveness and in these last 4 tears Teva [still oval, peach/orange color] working the best for my A.D.D. Pills made by Mallinkrodt I only get by mistake, and still act like a placebo in May 2020. Dose: 20mg. X 2 daily.		August 25, 2020	24
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I do not like this formula. I have been on various generics for years and did not feel like this 10 mg did anything. Unfortunately, I've already filled this prescription and am stuck with this medication.	1	August 24, 2020	7
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been taking Adderall for most of my adult life and Walgreens always carried the generic version that worked best for me but recently they changed who they get it from now and the new amphetamine / dextroamphetamine from Lannett MFG SUCK!  They do not work at all - actually the worst next to the  YELLOW ROUND Mp 447's, PINK ROUND Cor 136's, or OCTAGON WHITE ONES.   The TEVA amphetamine/dextroamphetamine Peach Oval B 974's are the ones that work best for me and now I don' t know how to get them - Help..	10	June 16, 2020	93
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	My concern in taking generic Adderall IR for several years is the effect is has on my heart  When I take it, at the prescribed dose,  I most always have sinus tachycardia  (a heart rate above 100 beats per minute)  I also have noticed that it effects bladder emptying....and my urinary stream seems slower (and I am fairly young) and I am not usually able to completely empty my bladder.	6	June 10, 2020	26
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Since the shortage for about 3 months I've been taking generic Zydus 20mg. How do these drugs pass inspection? I think a couple pixie sticks would work better. I wonder if generic adderall from any manufacturer will ever get better. I think charging over $5.00 for this rubbish should be criminal.	1	June 7, 2020	40
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	This medication amphetamine/dextroamphetamine has made me feel VERY JITTERY and sick to my stomach! I take generic TEVA brand orange tab 30 mg. The pharmacy didn’t have any of the TEVA brand so they gave me generic U31 tablet - Aurolife Pharma, LLC brand. This is horrible! People take time off work to be seen by doctor, get put on meds for a reason, spend money for the appointment and meds, all the time you spend doing this & it can’t be returned back to Walmart to get my right medicine because “it’s against the law” supposedly! Even when I have the entire prescription (minus one) to give them back. Why make people feel like this when they do so much to try and make life easier being on their meds. I don’t have insurance so my doc visit is almost $100 & medicine is around $60 every month. My 7 year old daughters meds were switched as well. I’m scared to even give her medicine! How can Walmart just give you a different brand that you’ve never taken and not tell me before I leave it’s different!?	1	June 5, 2020	67
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	Fatigue	I have been through about all anti-depressants, mood stabilizers, and anti-psychotics for my severe treatment-resistant depression and this medicineamphetamine/dextroamphetamine has saved me. Honestly, I have horrible anxiety as well. I have Chronic PTSD and Generalized Anxiety Disorder. This medicine calms my nerves as well. I can actually take naps during the day now when I need to instead of not being able to rest. It helps my impulsiveness from my Bipolar Disorder that is included in my Schizoaffective diagnosis. I may have to deal with the hallucinations but this medicine is the only medicine that works for me in the most positive way. For me, it has way less severe side effects than any medicine I have tried. It mainly helps with my energy levels which helps my depression because I feel more useful I also am more social which helps my confidence. The only thing I struggle with is the lack of appetite and it seems like water goes right through me. But, It is definitely a life saver for me. <3	10	May 3, 2020	32
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I am a male in my thirties. Adderall is the third drug I tried to tread ADHD after doing trials on Vyvanse and Concerta. Vyvanse worked but did not last long enough and I had bad crashing (headache, exhaustion). Concerta did not work for me at all, made me lethargic and even more distracted.  Adderall at 20mg a day gives me energy to focus on work and my kids. It lasts me until sometime in the evening. I have trouble sleeping some nights on it, other than that the side effects are negligible.	8	May 3, 2020	43
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Activist Dextramp-amphet ER (30 mg.) [ generic for Adderall ]  is HORRIBLE. NOT effective.

ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for Narcolepsy	Generic Adderall is not the same. I feel immediately awful when I realize they switched me to generic dextro amp (amp salts works not sure what brand. I heard Teva might have moved distribution centres and have been alternating approved cheaper alternative ingredients. Well guess what they don’t work AT ALL. Check the generic brands when you get your script filled and see how you feel. The old generic brand I took worked just fine. I cannot get out of bed for weeks because whatever “similar” generic cheap alternatives they are using do not make the cut. Welcome back debilitating fatigue!	6	April 12, 2020	129
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Adderall is very useful but recently I was ignorant and thought it would be okay to take a little extra at night to help clean my house. I took a bigger extra dose then I should have and a few hours later I felt pretty awful. I am very productive and more positive on the right dose of this med, so I recommend trying it or Desoxyn, because it is said to have fewer side effects like anxiety and panic and irritability post dose. Like all meds, Adderall is a blessing when dosed right and a curse when dosed incorrectly. I noticed that I paced around a bit when on it but I didn’t feel that anxious. It isn’t fun and enjoyable to take a big dose, don’t do it. God made everything to be used in moderation and it is much better for the whole society when we obey the wise instructions of our doctors and leaders. Be careful, obey your doctor, and may God bless you all to succeed in your treatment plans and in your lives. Amen	8	March 18, 2020	74

ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Recently changed pharmacies and didn't realize that there can be quite a difference between generics. For 4 years I’ve taken adderall 2x day, 10 mg. Never any problems until I switched pharmacies to save $.  Elite Pharma is who makes this new one and it is NOT GOOD.   I am lethargic, unable to focus, quite sleepy.

ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	The generic manufacturer of amphetamine & dextroamphetamine, Sandoz, is the only one that works for me. This month the manufacturer is Northstar and last month Aurobindo, and they are garbage. They don’t help AT ALL with my focus. Zero.  I am irritable. I am getting nothing done and my anxiety is sky high. I am going to stop taking these brands and ask pharmacy for Sandoz.  I complained to the FDA and urge others to do so as well. This is ridiculous.	1	March 3, 2020	70
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Adderall has worked great for me when taken as needed. When I was in my early 20’s and taking it daily I built up a dependence that lead to terrible withdrawals as it is very addictive. (Learned the hard way and never want to go through that again!)  I will usually only take this when my ADHD symptoms are unbearable and my work/personal life starts to become affected. We are talking maybe 1-4 tablets max per month.  It really does help with focus and energy, and I find that one 10-20mg dose is usually enough and I feel good for several days after the dose without any withdrawals or dependence issues.

ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	If you're taking for ADHD please note there are a lot of side effects, having said this, they are sometimes serious so take note to talk to your doctor. If you get cold fingers or toes, make sure to consult your doctor as it's a syndrome that can be prevented.  It does help with focus, it helps with impulse control, it helps with a general overall euphoric feeling and it can cause you to lose a lot of weight. Be sure to eat, EAT, don't shake your head, you know I'm talking to you. Eat and stay hydrated it causes you to urinate a LOT, make sure to supplement what you are losing. It will cause tremors, shakes, and irritability, again, eat food. Make sure to stick to a 2000 calorie diet AT LEAST. May cause muscle fatigue and extreme soreness, stay hydrated, make sure of this.  Some say it causes better grades in school, well, to an extent. It just makes you write a lot. Eat Eat Hydrate And maybe take melatonin to help promote rest. I warned and entertained you.	7	February 21, 2020	97

Both weren't that great for me so my doctor prescribed me 10 mg of Adderall XR. Adderall has made me have better multitasking skills and helped me pay attention. It hasn't really helped with being hyper or being impulsive and has given me bad twitching eyes. It also has made my sleep schedule weird so watch out for that.	6	February 6, 2020	23

Before Teva bought out multiple companies and started using their ingredients within the last 2-3 years, they were great. Sandoz and Corepharma have been the only other decent makers, before they were bought out. I haven’t noticed a thing from picking these up 1/24. The worst medicine I’ve had from Teva in 8 years.	1	February 4, 2020	36
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	On 1/24/2020 I received Teva generic IR Adderall like I usually have for the last 7 years off and on (used to be good.) Except Barr was labeled on the bottle for the first time ever. Not sure why since Teva bought Barr in 07. Regardless it isn’t any better, by far the worst I’ve had of Teva. But every other company is pathetic. Brand works 10X better but 10X pricier. If the FDA enforced the rule of not less than 80% and no more than 125% concentrated effectiveness, that would be a first! The right MG of each dose might be regulated, but the fillers/inactive ingredients added is the big issue. 1-3 used to be in the old Barr/ Shire/ Sandoz/ Core and those worked fantastic. Every generic now has 5-8 fillers that make it less effective but also cause severe side effects. FDA could care less about small market drugs.	1	February 3, 2020	50
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Game changer. First DX by A pdoc: ADHD. What, no?  Yes.  I felt like I was only working with one puzzle piece and finding out about ADHD was like being given the other 999 pieces. At first Adderall IR didn’t seem to do much but I slowly realized it was like putting emotional and mental blinders on where I could see the rest of the world but mainly focus on the task at hand. Job saver for sure.  Since I have a high tolerance to meds XR saved me from constantly trying to remember to take next dose when I started crashing. Tops.	10	February 3, 2020	30
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I have found the generic brand for Adderall is not effective as the brand name. The Epic brand caused me to have severe depression, blurred vision, headaches, very tired and no focus at all.  I’m trying to find a brand that is much like the name brand. Looking for suggestions if anyone can share please. Thanks	1	January 29, 2020	95
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I went to pharmacy to pick up my Adderall generic brand Zydus. I was told they was out of my brand. I was given the Epic brand. The Epic brand caused me to have severe depression and I stayed in bed, I’ve always been very energetic. I stopped taking it. I called the Pharmacist and reported the side effects I had. Pharmacist didn’t act surprised at all, stated we are out of your regular brand and probably won’t get it back in.	1	January 28, 2020	18
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Generics make me feel ill, sometimes headache, sometimes itching or hives.  Google where generics are made.	1	January 24, 2020	45
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	"I was so glad to see these posts.  Pharmacies are so rude to me. I switched to so many brands, but they say they are all alike, and say it doesn't matter which generic I get, because they're all the same.  My doctor, unfortunately, thinks the same.  I finally said to the pharmacy tech one day, ""I'm sure I'm not the only one, who would like certain generics."" She said, no, I'm the only one. I know this sounds crazy, but the blue 10mg of teva, don't seem to work like the 15mg of the peach teva, even if I cut one of the blue in half to make it 15mg."	8	January 23, 2020	90
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I was taking 15mg of generic Adderall  amphetamine / dextroamphetamine  for 3 months and by the end of the 3rd month I had 3 separate people tell me I didn't seem myself. I'm a regularly joyful and excited person but every emotion I had felt muted or stunted while on amphetamine/dextroamphetamine. I stopped talking it and 3 days later felt so much better. I was joyful again! Back to pinging all over the place but at least I'm happy doing it lol. I'm trying Concerta next.	4	January 21, 2020	3
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Ok so I have Both Narcolepsy/Extreme Fatigue & ADD. The generic forms of Adderall (amphetamine and dextroamphetamine) seem to be getting worse and worse. They are making them with obviously cheaper so-called similar ingredients but the new generic amphetamine and dextroamphetamine drugs just have bad side effects and don’t work for me at all or are far less effective. I don’t know if it is Teva brand that is making these cheap ineffective knock-offs that cause migraines & other side effects but they are definitely not working or decent. The generic form Amphetamine Salts works just fine for me but again I think when Teva took over and apparently used far cheaper Ingres there is definitely a disconnect because I don’t think Dextroamp-Amphetamin is a worthy generic form of Adderall but maybe just because Teva brand seems to be using incredibly cheap ingredients,	10	January 20, 2020	21
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	Mydayis (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I've had ONE DOSE.  Let me be clear.  I took one 25mg pill 6 hours ago and I'm so sleepy I can't see straight.  I slept 7.5 hours last night so I don't understand the drowsiness.	5	January 9, 2020	33
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’ve been on adderall for a few years now and it was life changing. I’ve always been prescribed a generic and have never had a problem until recently. I noticed that I was not getting the same benefit as I was previously and for months, tried to convince myself that it was in my head and then one month, I noticed everyday that I felt great! Looked at the pill imprint and what do you know - it was a different manufacture (Amneal) than the one I was taking. I started googling it and saw a lot of complaints for generic Adderall from Global Pharmaceutical. I’m talking to pharmacist today about it and requesting the generic by Amneal Pharmaceuticals. I thought they were all the same and it’s a shame that global can make these any less effective than what they should be. Is it so people go to their dr, say they don’t feel the effects of it and get an increase? Sounds like a big pharma thing to do. Trust your gut instinct because you’re the person who knows you best.	1	January 8, 2020	17
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for Narcolepsy	I have #IdiopathicHypersomnia & #narcolepsy. Not all generics are equal  1. #Corepharma works 2. Oval, peach #Teva does not  3. Teva started carrying same dark pink, round IR as #Corepharma  4. In 2018 Teva selling the oval, peach again 5. I filled the Rx with #Sandoz (round, peach) worked almost as well 6. Corepharma was purchased by #Epic.  7. I have been relying on Sandoz since 2018  Every month I have to call pharmacies see if Sandoz is in stock. Usually they don't have it & can't to order it. #JewelOsco is the ONLY pharmacy that places orders for me.   Today (01/05/2020), JewelOsco does not have any &  unable to place an order; the supplier is out & the date available is TBD  Has anyone tried #Northstar? How does it compare to Sandoz?  How is the pharmaceutical industry allowed to do this?

ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	"I recently was given this new form of adderall from the pharmacy which was circular with just an ""A"" on one side... I did not like this new form of Adderall at all!! I assumed it would have the same effect as the typical oval shaped and it was completely different which is a little scary. It was very bitter and gross tasting unlike the football shaped one has a sweet note. It also disintegrated turning to powder immediately, as I attempted to break it in half (waste of product). I did not get any focus from it nor did I feel any different at all?? It did nothing! Then the next day got a horrible headache! I was talking with a friend who also mentioned getting the same thing recently. He mentioned having an extremely bad headache too the following day, so we now know it's from this form of adderall. I DO NOT LIKE IT. It should be pulled from the market honestly I don't know what the heck this rubbish  is but it is not adderall."	2	January 2, 2020	79
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Was first diagnosed with ADD(inattentive type) by multiple doctors at 18 years old. Out of the gate they prescribed me 60mg IR amphetamine with dextroamphetamine. I am now 26, taking 80mg/day, and have learned a substantial amount about this drug. No it won't make you any smarter or develop hidden talents, most believe this. The generic (dextroamphetamine-amphetamine IR) is cheaper than its brand (Adderall xr.) Obviously brand is set to higher standards of quality than generics, so yes brand name anything works better than generics, it's common sense. If you use it correctly and find the right manufacturer like Teva, you most likely won't find as many negatives as most people.	8	December 30, 2019	9
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I’ve been taking the generic version of Adderall for about 2 years now. I was tired all the time and couldn’t focus. I felt like a slug and when I had energy I still had brain fog, and had a hard time studying. In class, I would fidget in my chair, doodle, and listen to lectures, but nothing would stick in my head. No matter how long I studied.  I was prescribed the 7.5 mg tablet once a day and just the small dose did wonders for my energy levels and let me focus and actually get things done. It helped me talk in social situations and gave me a mood boost.  That being said, The generics changed a couple times. And I’m not sure, but I think I can tell a difference between them. After the pill wears off, my head aches, my legs throb, my body aches, and I’m nauseous and feel sick. I have flu like symptoms, which are miserable. It’s sad because it’s a really small dose and helps me so much but some of the side effects suck. You just gotta see what’s worth it to you.	8	December 24, 2019	61
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	Fatigue	"This drug has absolutely saved my life. I have been diagnosed with severe CFS and depression approximately 14 years ago.  In 2015, I had my thyroid removed due to cancer, so I am on artificial thyroid. I could have slept for 20 hours a day and it wouldn't have been enough. I tend not to take it on weekends, as I don't need to be as ""awake"" as when I'm at work. I typically end up sleeping 12-14 hours straight on the days I don't take it. I would not be able to work full-time without Adderall. I have taken 30 mg for several years now and it has worked well for me; I have a hunch that it's because I don't generally take it on weekends, so my body gets that ""mini detox"" from it every week.   Really. This drug has saved my life. I can function again!"	10	December 5, 2019	24

ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for Narcolepsy	I was diagnosed with a sleep disorder/excessive daytime sleepiness and my physician prescribed me Adderall. After I found the dose that worked best for me (30mg in the morning and 10-20mg in the afternoon) I felt like a new person. I usually sleep anywhere from 12-18 hours a day when I don’t have classes or work (I don’t have to force myself up on these days with 2 alarms). I can still nap but they are not nearly as long as they used to be (3-8 hours). My grades have improved and most importantly, my attendance of class has improved! I used to sleep through class, but now I can go because my body isn’t begging for sleep. Overall it is an extremely helpful drug to treat narcolepsy/excessive daytime sleepiness. I finally feel like I have my life back! My only complaint is the dry mouth I experience every so often. I also still feel rather tired some days but it is not as NEAR as torturous as it used to be. Overall, it is extremely helpful and it has changed my life for the better.	10	November 20, 2019	54
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Not very effective; I took a  double dose which cause headaches and made me generally feel ill.  There are  better generics. Company should not be allowed to sell this medication.	1	November 17, 2019	13
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been on Adderal 10 mg for three months now. I have found it helps me so much in the morning. I need to talk to my doctor and see if I can get something for the afternoon. It's been a godsend but I don't have any anger issues just a lot of anxiety. I'm on Xanax as well three times a day and Ambien for sleep which really helps bed by 5 clock I'm wore out. And then my symptoms seem to return. I would recommend this to anyone that has concentration issues. I'm 41 years old and when I went to school they always called you slow. Which always made you look bad. I think my doctor he's wonderful and I'm going to get my Xanax upped and see if I can get something for the afternoon due to that I work many hours a day and I have to be on my toes.	9	November 2, 2019	6
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I got diagnosed with ADHD at the beginning of this school year, being my senior year of high school. Since 8th grade, I've struggled in school, been incredibly impulsive, had very strange eating habits, over-thought everything, and could never contain my anger or anxiety. Once prescribed, my life has changed. My grades went up, and in 3 months I've lost almost 30 pounds (I am still in the normal BMI range). I can control myself. I finally believe in myself because of Adderall.	9	October 29, 2019	79
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Well been on and off Adderall or Ritalin since I was 5. I'm 62 now, and take 60mg XR morning and two 30mg IR in the afternoon. For me it's a Godsend. I can pay attention now,  I'm more sociable, I'm just.......me.	8	October 23, 2019	22
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I’m 48 yo woman that was diagnosed with ADHD in elementary.  When I began (on holiday) taking it I’m extremely fatigue/zombie the first 3 days, I am not nearly as engaged with anyone/anything around me (I talk 97% less when I’m on Adderall) and it makes me feel less cognitive.  I feel like it dumbs me down.  After the 3rd day I start to feel better and those “tranquilizer effects” go away. Adderall is an emotional regulator for me. It works wonders for my impulsivity, racing thoughts, fidgeting, feeling overwhelmed, anger, anxiety, zoning out, and my mouth. Yes, my mouth has always been my biggest challenge and has caused me tremendous social/professional problems.  While in a perfect world I’d be on no medication, I have to recommend Adderall for anyone whose suffering from ADHD, because  it has changed my overall quality of life for the best.  Sparkle on beautiful people! 	9	October 23, 2019	81
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I was diagnosed with both bipolar and ADHD. After trying multiple combinations, we finally tried adderall on top of Wellbutrin, Lamictal, and Fluvoxamine for OCD. At first, the adderall did wonders. Completely made me enjoy life again. However, as my tolerance increased, the adderall crash was very intense. It resulted in a bipolar low almost everyday around the same time. I recently just switched to Stratetta and is my second day taking it. Anxious to see how this works.	9	October 22, 2019	29
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	Mydayis (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I’ve been taking meds for ADHD/ADD close to 8 years now.  Tried Adderall at many dosages, types and amount of times per day over a period of many years.  My biggest issue. I forgot to take them.  Tried Vyvanse. It helped but I got nauseous, dizzy every day.  Tried Adderall again and forgot to take them.  One day my doctor mentioned Mydayis. I wouldn’t have to remember taking more than one in the AM.  After a week I could tell that it was helpful but wasn’t able to tell if a BIG difference.  I ran out due to scheduling once & my brain went into hyper drive. I hadn’t felt that chaotic for awhile.  WHILE talking to my doctor she legit wrote out the prescription, handed it to me. ‘go fill it NOW.’ Even had others asking how long I would be without it.  It was clear it helped at that point.  I don’t notice any side effects.  My results with Mydayis are pretty good. No worries of forgetting it, which was the major factor in my switch.	8	October 20, 2019	11
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	Mydayis (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I'm making this review one year after trying Mydayis for only a week. I switched to this drug from Adderall IR 20's BID to the 37mg capsule, you don't really think your buzzing, but you indeed are, and more so than with Adderall for the same dose. What prompted me to write this review was that I noticed someone else who reviewed this mentioned that they would be returning the bottle to the pharmacy because they didn't want insurance to think they were keeping it. This is an effect of the drug, I too, even though I bought it on the $5 coupon, did not want the pharmacy (who does not care) to think that I wanted to keep this drug so I returned the remaining 23 capsules to them. It works well, puts you in a different state of mind, and doesn't provide the sense well being of some other ADHD products offer, but it does work better than some generics. Perhaps give this a try if you're on generics that don't work. It is pretty strong, but doesn't feel like it. if that makes sense.	7	October 14, 2019	12
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I was on 10MG XR for 3 months and it worked amazingly. This is a very good medication if you have trouble functioning like a normal person, although be prepared for really dark thoughts if you decide to stop taking it. Withdrawal from this drug is no joke, it can make you want to die...but if you keep taking it or taper off slowly you should be fine.		October 12, 2019	22
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I was diagnosed with ADD in 2005 after experiencing horrible distractibility in class while at college and not being able to focus on a single thought in my head.  I was prescribed Adderall IR and I remember feeling like I had drunk 5 Red Bulls or something!  My heart was pounding and I had horrible anxiety the whole day.  I only took it one time.  I decided to get off it immediately.  Soon after, I was prescribed Strattera, which didn't do ANYTHING.  I've gone for about 13 years without actual ADD medications because I really hated the idea of stimulants.  That all changed when I realized my ADD was getting out of control.  I saw my current psychiatrist last week who re-diagnosed me and we discussed my experiences.  I had read reviews from people here who say that Dexedrine works for them if Adderall made them too wired, so I asked if I could try that.  I just tried it today and I had no horrible side effects - no anxiety, no heart palpitations, no edginess, etc.  It is wonderful!	1	October 9, 2019	21
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for Narcolepsy	I was recently diagnosed with Narcolepsy in early 2019. I was started on Adderrall, but it took about 6 months to get the regimen that worked for me. I was quite sick at the stomach for about 3 months with nausea, and headaches. I take 30 mg at 9 am, and 10 mg at 1 pm. Finally, it's working well to a certain degree.  I still need at least two naps during the day and have most of my energy in the morning and early afternoon. Come 7-8 pm, I'm literally exhausted. I realized how well the medication worked after I missed a dose. I wondered why I was yawning all day and barely able to stay awake. It was because I had forgotten to take my Adderrall. Despite how well it works, I still seem to yawn almost constantly. I would not be able to get through the day without it. It's not 100 percent fix, but I can function for most of the day using it. So, that's a plus for me.	9	October 8, 2019	17
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for Narcolepsy	I was originally prescribed for adult ADD. I took it for several weeks with some results, but I soon learned that it was great for a sleep disorder as well. Recently, I stopped taking it, but soon afterward, all I could do was sleep all day. I was extremely fatigued. I had a blood test for hypothyroidism but it was negative. The only side effect for me was hypertension which I take medication for, but lately, it has been elevated. Nothing the doctor can't fix by increasing the dosage of my blood pressure med. I don't plan to stop this mediation unless I need a larger dosage to work. Currently taking Adderall XR 20mg in the morning and regular Adderall  20mg at noon. Moreover, it helps ease my craving for carbs. It works better than any antidepressant.		October 5, 2019	22
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	Mydayis (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I have suffered my entire life with ADD.  For a while Adderal helped. Then as I turned 49 it seemed to make me more anxious, irritable,  short tempered, and I had No patience for stupidity! Upon trying the Mydayis,  I was immediately impressed. I was finishing projects.  Getting things done right! Able to focus for longer durations of time. Long enough to complete tasks at hand. I feel so much better.	10	October 3, 2019	30
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I will never give this to my child again!, I know all children are different but I'm sticking with Dyanavel XR. While he was on Adderall he was acting angry and violent, like he was on some kind of illegal drug, his facial expressions were intense, and he could not sit still, and was very emotional. so I have to give this a 1 star on my personal experience and my son's	1	October 2, 2019	35
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I've had a prescription for amphetamine with dextroamphetamine for  four years, and Teva used to work fairly well for me. Over the last year or so, it's become awful. I know it isn't me, because I still have old (2-3 years) pills laying around; I tried some of them and they work just fine.   Teva changed something in the manufacturing process. The new pills do almost nothing beneficial (I feel sleepy all day), but they have a ton of side effects. I feel very jittery, my stomach hurts, and I've been experiencing bloating.	1	September 30, 2019	23
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Overall, 20 mg Adderall XR for ADHD helps me to focus. The problem with adderall is it makes me sweat something awful. Anyone else annoyed with sweating while taking adderall?	9	September 28, 2019	62
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Well first off. Adderall is an Amphetamine  which assist with the production of dopamine. Very close  relation to meth. I am 21 years old and I started Adderall again. Previously I was on Adderall from age 8-13 and it worked great. Some say ADHD is not real and it just a symptom of bad health etc... I have been very very healthy and unhealthy which produced no changed in brain fog. Now that engineering is my main task in like I seem to have a hefty amount of brain fog. Adderall does in fact help with focus but the downside is the extreme crashes that happen when you stop taking it.	8	September 26, 2019	20
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been on Adderall for quite sometime. It has helped me focus and also being proactive. I recently got a new script and diff manufacturing teva  I noticed since I have taken it I'm extremely tired. Cannot focus at all I feel like a scatter brain..I had to call my dr to have him rewrite a new script and surrender the Teva (amphetamine with dextroamphetamine) Did anyone get the same reaction?	1	September 26, 2019	20
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I shared my experience recently on here and was going back over and reading others as well.  I believe we should all state the laboratory that producing the specific generic we are each taking. Doing so may help us all narrow down which ones to stay away from and which ones are truly therapeutic.  Eon lab  brand of amphetamine/dextroamphetamine was good until 9 months ago, now they are horrible (no therapeutic value and bad side effects).  I then I switched to Teva and they were decent for about 2 months and now they are giving me side effects.  Plus the pharmacy ran out of them and I had to wait for a new batch and when the new batch came in is when the bad side effect started.  I KNOW the drug manufacturer has changed something.  Hope that helps someone.	2	September 24, 2019	121
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	Narcolepsy	I have been on generic Adderall (dextroamphetamine -amphetamine) for about a year and a half. I have always got the Teva brand with no issues. But in the last couple months I have noticed it not working as well. I just filled my script last week and they are even worse! I keep dozing off at work and back to taking naps in my car on lunch again. It's very frustrating! I take 30mg twice a day for narcolepsy. Last month during to the shortage on 30mg my script was shorted by 9 pills. This time the manufacturer was Alvogen and they were amazing! Only time I came across this manufacturer. I wish my insurance would cover the brand name. They denied me even with my doctor's appeal.	1	September 23, 2019	9
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for Narcolepsy	I have been on D-Amphetamine Salt Combo, 30mg a day for a few months for narcolepsy and actually did great. But I recently picked up another prescription and noticed this brand is called Teva generic brand. I have noticed for 2 weeks I have became irritated, forgetting easily in what I was looking for or talking about, aggressive outbursts, stomach pain, migraines, generalist not feeling good on this brand. I will be complaining over this!	1	September 15, 2019	50
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	So, I have had ADHD since I was like young. I never liked the pills they gave me when I was younger because I was already a thin kid and then taking Adderall I would eat even less. So I stopped taking the medication. When I was taking this medication I got most improved student! I went without the drug for years, until just about 2 years ago I started taking it again and It has helped me so much! I am very thankful for this drug. I suffer from fatigue , and many, many other problems. This drug is one of many I NEED, To Think Straight and to not get outta control.  It also helps me BIG TIME with my anger issues. Hope this helps someone! Star Kid Is OUT!	9	September 11, 2019	47
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	This drug is one of the greatest formulas of all time.

ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I cannot believe that the FDA allows AUROBINDO or TEVA to sale their lousy drugs through pharmacies in the US.

ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Have taken Adderall on and off for around 13 years for ADD and CFS. I was lucky enough to have tried the “real” brand Adderall by Barr laboratories. I’ve never taken over 20mg a day. This medicine has gone to TRASH.The only negative side affect from the Barr version was occasional jaw clinching.   I think Teva must’ve burned the patent formula or something because it has never worked liked the Barr, not even close.  So many negative side effects (migraine headaches, heartburn, nausea)! I keep hoping at some point they might magically start producing a decent version that actually helps instead of hurts.  The original Barr had true therapeutic value.  Eon labs produced a decent generic for a while, but BAM, it suddenly went to garbage at the end of 2018.  So switched back to Teva a couple months back and it started ok( not as good as Eon but better than everything else out there), then last months refill is feeling like they’re changing to something bad too.  Bring back real Adderall!	3	September 4, 2019	78
ACT Amphetamine XR -  25MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I had taken Adderall for many years and was slowly on the decline.  I was deeply depressed and had an absolute hopeless and helpless outlook on life with no relief. I had psychosis, delusions and impulsive behavior which I never had. I began having issues with memory, thinking, reasoning, decision making, tasks, and  concentration.  I would become very agitated if being interrupted. I was very aggressive and agitated constantly, it was at least 98% of the time in 10 years.  I read horror stories about stimulants, namely the Amphetamine line of them. I subsequently tapered off of them and feel 100% better than before. I have no depressive symptoms, delusions, memory problems, agitation or aggressiveness. I was not happy with life and my personal relationships were very toxic. I wasted almost 10 years of my life feeling like this and have other personal complications that resulted from the use of these toxic drugs.	1	August 28, 2019	29
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I have taken Adderall XR and short acting for 25 years and I got this new XR 30MG the other day Lannett and it made me tired, heart racing, BP accelerated and did NOTHING to help me focus. I contacted the pharmacy and my Dr and he's trying to switch me to another brand because this is a joke. awful..	1	April 26, 2021	3
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Just started taking adderall XR 10mg after learning I had been mis-diagnosed for 15+ years as either bi-polar, major depressive disorder and social anxiety. I finally found a psychiatrist that really dug deep and concluded I was not bi polar but I suffered from adult ADHD (33 year old male). It makes total sense as I read more about ADHD. I had been on every possible anti-depressant, anti psychotic MDD etc and was just done with meds. I was diagnosed as a child and teen but thought “ I’d grow out of it” and apparently never did it just got worse. I feel that so many people are mis-diagnosed it’s almost unbelievable. My theory and the doctor also said that if you take the medication and it calms you and your racing thoughts that that’s a tell tail sign that you do indeed suffer from ADHD, it’s not just a childhood/school era problem, it disrupts your life, marriage everything. I’m on day 2 and it’s like a light switch has been turned on and I can relax and not be manic.	9	April 25, 2021	3
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been on and off generic Adderall for many years. Currently, I have been prescribed 30 mg twice a day. For the last couple of months, it's been a nightmare. It's been on backorder and then changed the generic name from amphetamine salts combo to amphetamine/ dextroamphetamine combo. This is only because I have had severe headaches, extreme fatigue, and a loss of motivation. My ADHD has been out of the roof. It's frustrating because I feel like I did before taking any generic Adderall. I have even been concerned that maybe I was receiving a placebo rather than the actual medication. That's probably far-fetched, but it's been such a decline for me. There is something missing from this generic form and it is the essential thing that is needed to control my ADHD. I have even gained a lot of weight over the past two months. Hopefully, something will give, I can't imagine it affecting people like this and nothing changing.	3	April 19, 2021	8
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	This pill does not work like any Adderall that I have experienced. There is neither the focus or the energy bump that is typically associated with the two most therapeutic aspects of the formulation. The vast majority of time I feel equally as sleepy and unfocused as I did when I took it.    I am an experienced user of this positive life-changing medication. The patients that us this medication are in a bad position when company’s that make inferior generic medications are allowed distribution rights through equally as corrupt retail pharmaceutical outlets seeking to make a few pennies extra per script, on the back of patients whose experienced opinion is rarely considered.	2	April 17, 2021	2
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I have taken ADHD meds many years. Adderall XR is the ADHD med that works the best for me. I am taking a generic manufactured by Lannett. It by far has worked the best for me with the reason(s) being is the smoothness, the come up is very quick, and it does it's job perfectly.   To reiterate, Lannett is very smooth with a quick come up, and last long enough most days.	9	April 15, 2021	4
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	If anyone else is having a terrible time with the new Lannett generic adderall you can report this to the FDA.  I have been having crippling headaches, stomach aches, and the medication doesn’t even feel like it works!!! I get tired after I take it and then can’t sleep all night because of it. HORRIBLE. Google fda medwatch online reporting to fill in the form	1	April 9, 2021	33
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Right now I take 50mg Lamictal for my Bipolar and 7.5mg twice a day Adderall for ADHD. At first I wasn't sure Adderall was going to work for me, I was initially prescribed 20mg twice a day.  That dose ended up being way too high for me, It made be become manic and I felt really wired all the time.  I now take 7.5mg twice a day and have found it to be much better. I feel alert and focused throughout the day.  Some of the side effects I have had are weight loss, jaw clenching, and mild insomnia (I usually just take melatonin). Overall, Adderall has helped me a lot, I just had to find the right dosage.	8	April 8, 2021	0
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been on Adderall for several years and the Sandoz brand is TOXIC and HORRIBLE! At first it is like a sugar pill no effect and then dizziness, headache, feeling more confused, spaced out and mind blank, extreme fatigue. I can't believe this is on the market. FDA honestly needs to step up their game and monitor the generics. It is a up and down roller coaster with different manufactures each month. This is insane. They are robbing us blind in the pharmaceutical business. They give us something toxic or a placebo. What is happening to the medications now. Please do not take the Sandoz. Read the court documents about reviews on them and they came from the company. Making themselves sound great as a pretend customer!! I can not believe how bad this medication from this manufacture is.	1	April 6, 2021	10
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Worked really well for the first week or so, but then really made me more irritable and gave me uncontrollable suicidal urges that ultimately sent me to the hospital. The suicidal urges stopped after dropping the medication.  I wouldn't recommend against the medication, I would just proceed with caution as the side effects can vary in intensity from person to person.	1	April 3, 2021	3
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I have been prescribed Amphetamine Salt Combo which has worked well(I have ADD and narcolepsy). Today I was given from RX, Amphetamine Aspertate, it make me fell kinda sickness. Was I given the wrong medicine. The prescription has not changed ?	7	April 1, 2021	3
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I’ve been on Adderrall immediate release for at least 8 years, probably more. At first Adderrall gave me an intense high and made me very talkative. Very talkative. That lasted for a few days and after that each morning when I took it it gave me a euphoric feeling for about have the day. I wasn’t making impulsive decisions like I had in the past and my focus was razor sharp. I really enjoyed this drug for sometime but the last 3-5 years it’s just been the same old same old. I take it in the morning and have somewhat of a boost in energy and focus but after around 11am the effects of the medication just wears off. I wind up feeling irritable, decent level of focus if I’m busy at work, and just downright not very social with people. This week I’m going to see my P.A. and hopefully get on Vyvanse which I was encouraged by many to try before jumping on Adderrall. Vyvanse is more expensive but I’m ready to feel more focused and more myself.	5	March 28, 2021	4
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	This review is for generic Adderall XR - amphetamine/dextroamphetamine. I've experienced wildly different effects from different manufacturers. Some days it didn't work. Some days it worked great. But I got severe debilitating headaches that lasted 24/7 and didn't go away using ibuprofen. Went to neurologist and got an MRI. If I could push past the side effects it did work well but for only about 4-5 hours after kicking in (which took about an hour). Needed a booster of IR in the afternoon, so eventually I couldn't deal with the headaches and switched to IR completely. Headaches gone almost immediately. I still get them with IR but not anywhere near as often or as bad.	6	March 23, 2021	1
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Mydayis (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	"I've tried several ADHD meds and Mydayis has definitely been the best for me. I'm on the lowest dose and it starts working 20-30 minutes after I take it. I'm then able to be productive and direct my focus easily, compared to other meds (eg-Adderall) which gave me a burst of intense focus that I had no control over. The transitions are barely noticeable and it really helps maintain consistent energy levels. After wearing off, it's a very natural ""I've worked all day and now I'm ready to relax before bed"" feeling (no crash). I also noticed it significantly helps manage my depression-something no other ADHD med has done. The only downsides: (1) it does reduce my appetite a lot and (2) it only lasts about 9-10 hours on my current dose (12.5mg), but higher doses (25mg+) give me headaches. It's not perfect, but the positives definitely outweigh the negatives for me. Lastly-you don't know how it'll affect you, so don't let reviews scare you away if you/your doc think it might help."	9	March 21, 2021	4
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I was diagnosed with ADHD at age 17 and only really started taking stimulant medication after I had turned 20 last year. I was originally trying out varying doses of IR but started trying XR in the past few months.  Overall: Hit or miss for me. It does help with my focus, but the side effects and how much it helps varies pretty drastically depending on the day. Biggest side effects are dehydration, lack of appetite, potentially crashing at night (normal). I also feel a bit uncomfortable sometimes (anxiety-ish twitchy feeling) but that's not very common.  The mallinckrodt brand I was switched to recently seems maybe a bit more hit or miss honestly I can't really tell that much of a difference (unlike people on opioids who swear that mallinckrodt is awful). I'm on 25mg for now and I'm gonna keep seeing how I feel in the coming weeks. Helps with ADHD no doubt, but do be weary of the side effects.	7	March 16, 2021	2
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Mydayis (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I took Mydayis 37.5 mg for 2 years. I just recently ran out and decided to wait a week to refill. I cannot believe the change in myself! While on it I became withdrawn and too focused on 1 specific thing. I cut out people and ruined my small business. I didn't feel human! I can't explain the feeling but now that I haven't taken it in a week I feel like myself again! I was just flesh living day by day on mydayis! I will NEVER touch it again! Please tell me there's others out there with similar experiences	1	March 12, 2021	5
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	"I have been taking teva 20mg adderall from 06-19 when they disappeared. I had already suffered from side effects from other generics due to CVS giving me a different generic a few times without consent or being informed. I did the whole google wormhole for a few months before finally seeing a random comment about ""INACTIVE"" ingredients and how this person suffered terrible side effects across multiple generic medications with this same ""INACTIVE"" ingredient. Being on multiple meds myself and having autoimmune and neuro disorders it affected my mental health knowing something wasn't right and just not grasping why & not understanding. That random comment changed everything for me ""INACTIVE"" does not equal no effect.  Teva not being an option then and now not at all I use Mallinckrodt and Arubindo 20 mg. I find it helps to switch them every couple months or I take M in the morning and A in the afternoon depending on how my body is functioning. I tried SAndoz that was terrible side effects."	8	March 6, 2021	2
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Narcolepsy	I've been on adderall 20 mg 3× a day for over 10 years from secondary narcolepsy due to a TBI. I will only take Teva there plenty of generics that don't work and are less than a 10% out of 100% I got these I think Mallinckrodt U30 on it I tried returning it after taking 3 and falling asleep they wouldn't return so I took about 7 more just to get home from the pharmacy 1hour drive without passing out it did nothing. If I took 4 Teva I'd bounce off the walls won't sleep for at least 1 day. I will never again take anything besides the Teva after sleeping for the remainder of the month. I wish I could afford the brand name. Don't listen to any pharmacist generic aren't close I can't believe they get away with saying there same as brand lol body doesn't lie. Scumbags looking for profit due not caring who suffers	9	March 5, 2021	5
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	My 7 year old son is a first grader and was recently diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. He has been recommended Adderall for this but I am a bit reluctant to initiate its usage. I have a few reservations about how long it lasts in our system which I have heard can prove to be dangerous for a young kid. I have read multiple articles like these, but I am still not so sure. Seeing the number of experienced people here, please tell me if I should continue with it.		March 4, 2021	4
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	First time taking Alvogen generic amphetamine with dextroamphetamine 30mg. Been taking adderall for 2 years but always Teva generic. Oh my God, the Alvogen brand has made me feel so sick. All over severe headache, nauseous, vomiting, diarrhea. I feel awful. No focus, no energy, can't keep anything down, running to the bathroom.	1	February 27, 2021	8
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Been taking adderall for years. Until the had me try a white stop sign shaped one by mallinckrodt since there was an adderall shortage at my Walgreens. mallinckrodt amphetamine/dextroamphetamine shouldn’t even be labeled as amphetamine/dextroamphetamine it should just be sold as a caffeine pill because all it does is wake you up subtlety. It doesn’t help with focus whatsoever. I’ve already filed a complaint with the FDA and recommend everyone else do the same	1	February 25, 2021	20
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I take the 10 mg amphetamine with dextroamphetamine by Teva and it works great, better than the 15 mg.in my opinion. I see others mentioning generics by Alogen and Mallinckrodt here. Well I take a couple of other medications manufactured by these 2, on and off, most times it's Mallickrodt. Let me tell you, this is the WORST drug manufacturer on the market. The Alogen is junk too. I've been on a few medical chat sites just to see what I can find out about Mallinckrodt and see if others felt the same way and they absolutely do! Literally 100's of people have complained to the co. itself and to the FDA. This has been going on for a solid 5 years at least & the stuff is STILL pure unadulterated JUNK.	7	February 21, 2021	23
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Mydayis (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Switched from Concerta to Mydayis for the longer duration mechanism Mydayis offers. Was started on 25mg of Mydayis. ADD symptoms improved but I experienced dry mouth, dizziness, heart increase, and appetite decrease which subsided after the first week. Second week I felt like the dose was not effective. Doc switched me to 37.5mg of the mydayis and so far symptoms of ADD improved but side effects are rough. Dry mouth, headache, dizziness, lack of appetite, increased anxiety. I’m on day 4 or 5 so hoping the side effects subside when my body adjusts to the higher dose... fingers crossed.	6	February 20, 2021	4
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I am currently on Adderall XR 30MG, and it has changed so many different aspects of my life, including depression.  I was prescribed Adderall because I was about to be terminated from my job. Back to the drug, I take it around 6am everyday, and found that my overall mood has changed. I am not as emotional as I was before, yet I am still able to express my feelings when necessary without the full breakdowns. I have been dealing with Major Depressive Disorder, and this medication has alleviated most of those feelings.  However, the medication has not been a miracle drug, and it contains no magic! For me, ADD has always been there. For me, it took me to be 36 years old to finally realize it was time to visit a psychiatrist, regardless of all the negative stigmas; I was glad I did, because it gave me many suspected answers, rather than self diagnosing situations.	9	February 15, 2021	17
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’ve taken adderall for years. I used to be on Lannett brand and Walgreens recently switched to TEVA. I had my script switched from CVS to Walgreens because it was closer to me. I have been on it for 3 months and the side effects are TERRIBLE.  I clench my teeth so bad my teeth have broken, I am severely depressed, I can’t find happiness in literally anything. I don’t feel motivated at all. If anything I feel less motivated to get out of bed. My skin is dry, my eyes are sinking in and I get terrible migraines. My anxiety is so bad I’m anti social, and I thought I had a stroke because of side effects. I’m 25. Just don’t take it		February 13, 2021	7
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I take two 30 mg pills a day for ADHD and it has really made a huge difference in my life. I am able to focus on one task at a time and complete it. Works great for giving me the motivation I sometimes lack. Only issue is that when I was given the white or peach ones, they did not seem to work as well as the pink ones. Talked to doctor about it and she added to my prescription to only receive the pink ones. Curious if anyone else has had this issue	9	February 10, 2021	34
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	ALVOGEN INC has got me all messed up. I've taken ADHD meds since 1st grade and I'm 32 now so I'm very confident in my ability to distinguish between generics that work & don't and why. For the past 4 years I've used the same CVS location to fill my Adderall tab 30mg generic the past two times though I received a pill that looked different thinking okay whatever this happens from time to time it is just a different manufacturer no big deal. I was wrong. I have had insanely high blood pressure increases, trouble sleeping, hardly any focus, SEVERE anxiety like where is feel like I can't breathe suddenly especially when I try to sleep, shaky hands, VERY noticeable heart palpitations, diarrhea, headaches and  weird emotional ups & downs. I've been vegan for 3 months now at first I was seeing a steady decrease in blood pressure but as soon as I started taking this new generic I'm topping out at 161/111 at the doctor a few days ago which is just absolutely bonkers and terrifying	2	February 9, 2021	9
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’ve taken TEVA adderall 20 mg IR for the past 2+ years. It worked greatly for my ADD & as an anti-depressant. HOWEVER, it has changed! Starting July 2020, the TEVA tablet was completely different. It was no longer sweet, the consistency was harder & the efficacy was compromised. I can take it & fall asleep hours later & there is ZERO anti-depressant effect. In fact, it deepens my depression.  I will submit a report to the FDA & I encourage everyone else to. Also, please research the complaints of TEVAs other generics. I’m not sure what to try next. I tried the Sandoz and it was actually worse. I received the hideous Zydus once-which gave me a migraine & intensely aching back.I believe it’s manufactured out of this country.  This experience has made me question ALL generic medications.   Please start researching yours & refuse to take these.  I tried switching to name brands but my ins. refuses to pay.	2	February 8, 2021	11
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Have used a generic for about 6 years now worked for me except it has turned me into a teeth grinder I do it all the time and now my teeth are worn to the point they are ruined.  My doctor said he never heard of that side effect but a recent visit to a dentist to try to fix my teeth I was told they see this all the time and this grinding may never go away. I need to find something that works without these side effects	6	February 4, 2021	9
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine)	My cardiologist who diagnosed me with dysautonomia prescribed me adderall in high school because my symptoms included extreme fatigue, brain fog, and *bad* orthostatic hypotension. He did not warn me about all the side effects I would experience (due partly to the fact that I do not have ADHD), and I was given a high dose to start. It did help with my fatigue and immensely improved my focus (can’t complain there, I was *hyper* focused), brain fog, and hypotension, but there were some questionable side effects I experienced for the almost 2 years I took it: complete lack of appetite, significant weight loss, resting tachycardia and angina (my dysautonomia makes my HR very high to begin with) Overall it definitely improved my quality of life for a time but it seems like a questionable Rx for people with this condition who are hyper adrenal, already experiencing an overactive sympathetic ANS, and have a high HR due to the cardio effects.	7	January 27, 2021	3
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I’ve been in this medication for almost a year . And it change my life in good way.

ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been taking Teva amphetamine/dextroamphetamine (adderall generic) for quite sometime for ADHD. In the last year, I noticed right away something was off. First was the obvious color. The Teva that has always worked for me with no problems (that was being weaned out in 2019) was as follows..  peach color and sweet, easy to swallow and not gag on. Teva now, is orange. The sweet taste that made it bearable to take has changed completely. My focus, clarity, motivation, and concentration has been/is immensely effected by the new ingredient change. (I don't have it at all)  My overall mental health, has declined quickly. It has caused my mood to completely change, headaches are constant, and upset stomach. All of this, and they don't even work. I struggle everyday now. Less main ingredient and more fillers means more pills can be produced, which means more money in the manufacturer's pocket..... Mental health should be top priority, especially being consistent with and not changing the ingredients.	1	January 17, 2021	50
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	This month is the first time I received sandoz adderall ER and it doesn't seem to work very well for me. Mallinckrodt doesn't seem to work too well for me either. I think Teva seems to work the best for me; even better than the name brand for adderall.	6	January 17, 2021	2
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I have suffered with ADHD since I was a young kid, I got diagnosed at the youngest age possible and I never got any help for it by my old doctor.  With my new doctor, he gave me Adderall XR to start out with 10 and than up it to 20 within a week if not effective.   I am on 20 MG now and it has changed my life, I failed school and life because I couldn't pay attention and now not only can I pay attention but this has also helped as my ADHD had caused Depression/Anxiety also OCD.	10	January 15, 2021	14
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Generic Adderall varies significantly depending on mfg. Reason being, the FDA says the mfg only has to “demonstrate” it “works in the same way “ as the brand-name. i.e. generic ingredients do  Not have to be same which is why so many don’t work and/or make people feel sick. My experience, the only generic that works like the brand-name is Prasco, which acquired Teva’s generic xr in 2016.  Few pharmacies use Prasco as their generic because it’s more expensive!  My Dr specifies “Prasco generic only” on my prescription for D-Amphetamine ER 30MG Salt combo. By law, the pharmacy must comply if Prasco is one of their overall suppliers. My insurance changed so I called Prasco to see if they sell to Costco. They do. Just takes a day or 2 for the pharmacist to order and fill my script. Walgreens used Prasco as their generic until recently. Now it’s Mallinckrodt which just filed for bankruptcy to settle a slew of opioid lawsuits. It’s all about $		January 8, 2021	59
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	The adderall name brand is 2-3 times better than generic adderall XR. The FDA should be inspecting these generic companies and make sure they are getting as high of quality ingredients. I urge anyone in generics to try real adderall for a month then decided for yourself. Decide to report the generics because we should be able to get a cheaper still 90$ for generic compared to $220+ for name brand.	10	January 7, 2021	18
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’m a doctor with ADHD. I’ve been on the generics to cut costs during tough times but I insist on the name brand adderall. No only is it smoother it lasts longer and helps even more than the generics. It’s a shame that cost is a bearing on necessary prescriptions and that generic are so much weaker and poorer quality. Generic adderall needs to step it up they have quality issues and their recipe is somehow flawed.	5	January 7, 2021	25
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for Narcolepsy	I was diagnosed with a severe case of narcolepsy about a year ago. I always thought it was my chronic fatigue that made me feel so sleepy all the time. I was finally referred to a sleep specialist who ordered a night and day time sleep study. When I received the results he told me I was a very sleepy person, his worst case in many years. I have been taking 20MG Adderall 3x a day. It does help but I'm still extremely tired throughout the day. The sleep doctor advised me in September that there's a newer medication that can be added to my Adderall but insurance didn't like to approve it and that in 6 months hopefully it will be easier to prescribe. I've seen somewhere that 60MG a day is the max for treating ADHD but that 90MG is the max for treating narcolepsy. I'm curious if that dose would improve my symptoms. Overall I'm happy with the medication as I never notice any side effects. I just want to feel more awake and less sleepy.	7	January 6, 2021	9

ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Mydayis (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I've only been taking it for 3 days but I can understand now when people say they feel it running in the background. So far no side effects other than appetite loss. I do feel energy from this but not like Adderall there's no anxiety tied to the energy its more like motivation than energy. One thing I've noticed is I like to always be doing something that is productive in some way. It's not the type of energy you get and use to dance or workout you feel driven to get things done.  It last for the whole 16 hours which surprised me I'm an ultra rapid metabolizer. I have no crash on this like I did with Adderall. I'm just waiting for my period now to see how the cramps are and giving the medicine more time to see if I do have any side effects, so far none but no appetite.	10	January 3, 2021	11
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I've been taking dextroamp-amphet ER 15mg once a day for roughly 3 months now and it's helped me greatly until 2 weeks ago and it's as if I cut my dose by 3/4! Is this normal and what dose, frequency, and type of adderall should I change to? I've heard about generic vs name brand, so what do the best ones look like?	6	December 30, 2020	1
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I've been prescribed adderall for 10yrs+ and without it mentally and physically I would be worse. I do have soreness, achy body, etc but have other health problems. Adderall has ROTTED MY TEETH OUT. Being 42 years old, fear ability to retain with out medicine as I age. I have severe withdrawal, to include extreme fatigue, severe constipation. I need the Adderral and helps some as without it life would be more difficult. All and all I would not manage without it very well but it is less effective as been taking for years. Take care and God Bless All. Be Safe!	7	December 24, 2020	10
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Narcolepsy	I take the regular Adderall 20mg in the morning, but do 10mg in the afternoon; along with my other prescribed stimulants since mornings are the hardest for me. I got a new prescription and after a couple days of feeling like complete rubbish and having unscheduled naps each day, I noticed it was different.   After having the name brand and suddenly switching to this generic; it made sense why I suddenly felt like I could never wake up, even on 480mg of stimulants each day. Even as I write this at almost 11pm, I have felt like I can't do anything but lay down and nod off throughout the day.  These generics are different and affect our quality of life. When your treatment works and suddenly you feel like you aren't even taking your medicine because of a sudden switch to a placebo-like generic is a huge problem.  Where is the consistency for these medications!?	1	November 30, 2020	25
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for Narcolepsy	Adderall worked well for a year then it wore off even with medication free holidays. When trying a new medication and stopping I didn’t realize how out of breath it was making me, I thought it was because I was fat.	3	November 25, 2020	7
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Fatigue	I just tried Alvogen brand of amphetamine/dextroamphetamine this month because my pharmacy. It is absolutely awful. I feel like my body is screaming, absolutely doesn’t help with energy or attention. Just increases anxiety. And I’m extremely lethargic. I strongly recommend against them.	1	November 25, 2020	27
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Regarding the post by DrKatz on 11/7/2020:.  I too take the 20 mg salt combo- manufactured by Teva, and have been on that specific brand for two and a half years.  I can definitely concur that something has changed with their product.   I am on a prescription of 80 mg a day and I too noticed a difference in taste, consistency of the pill itself, and it not working as well as it used to.  I am aware of a recall May 22nd by Teva for a few of their doses- the 20mg pill being one of them.   Thinking placebo, I inspected the pill closely: the depression level of the imprint is different, slight change in the oblong shape, the edging* (*like the cut/side profile of floor boards) and thickness + curvature.   The taste difference (bitter) I noticed in August. October back to normal but currently (Nov.) the taste changed again- however this time with a much greater chemical profile- like bactine or rubbing alcohol, more crumbly and not working as well for either my ADHD or narcolepsy.	8	November 15, 2020	29
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I’ve been on Adderall XR 20 mg since October 6th 2020. I have to say this medication is life changing and your psychiatrist, doctor or whatever will try and find the right dosage for you. I’m 22 years old, Male and I noticed the medication working within an hour, I’m about 220 pounds 5’8 and despite that it still kicked in relatively fast. The side affects I notice the most are as follows dry mouth, appetite suppression, some irritability, and insomnia on occasion. Adderall XR for me last anywhere from 8-12 hours, if it wears off the medical professional in most cases will add Adderall IR to take in the afternoon, since upping the dose of XR will not increase duration only the intensity of the medication itself. ADHD medication is all about finding what’s right for YOU, don’t give up if it doesn’t get manageable or fixed after the first try.	9	November 8, 2020	41
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have always used Teva Adderall IR because I have had horrible experiences with other generic, including inconsistency and lack of potency.  Understand that I have taken Teva Adderall 20MG tablets over five years, thus it would less difficult for someone like me to detect subtle changes in its effects.  I have noticed the following, and this started around September 2020.  Teva generic Adderall tablets seem (and this is very subtle) smaller in size. Second: Teva is known for its slight sweet taste. It is almost as if that is completely  gone... I’m certainly not saying that added anything to it, but I’m saying it’s an indicator  of some sort of formula change.  Finally, although the 20MG tablet is small, it used to be easy to half the tablet. Recently they just crumble. To summarize, I have also noted a very marked decrease in efficacy.	7	November 7, 2020	26
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Adderall XR is Life changing (positively). I went from being massively distractable and procrastinate constantly to getting things done. I'm not just referring to school work or office work. I mean just showing up on time to meet up with friends. Not getting instantly bored with family.  I truly love it!   --- Quick warning, take it as your doctor recommends! So much of the bad press comes from people abusing the drug.  Likewise, if you're able, take a day off now and then. Perhaps on days when you don't need to work or do much. It's sort of like coffee/tea/caffeine in that sense. Fine if you do take it everyday, but probably best if you give your mind/body a rest from it now & then.  Just like running or exercise, you need light or rest days each week to really get the most from the workout.	10	November 6, 2020	33
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	My grades instantly went from the 60s and 70s to 90s and 100s and for once I felt like I had control over my life. The side effects were pretty bad and inconsistent though, so I had to go from 20 to 15 mg.	9	November 4, 2020	18
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine)	My son had been on every ADHD meds made by mankind since he was 5. He is 17 now, and because I go read reviews after the doctor changes his meds. I thought it might help someone who has went through all of them also. Adderall was the worst . My son was happy, enteric, easy go lucky and even on daytrana.  Ritalin, foculian, etc. he never lost himself. On adderall he was drowning mentally. Depression set in, moodiness, anger, punching walls, so mad he would black out, etc. Be very careful !!!!! Do not choose this one if you but all help it!	1	October 26, 2020	9
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	The Adderal dose my doctor prescribed didn't seem to work that great(20 mg twice a day)  One day I had it after my oatmeal and it was more effective so after that I just scrunched up the pill like I did with oatmeal, but I didn't put it on anything.  I just took it like that. Works great!  Much more motivation to get tasks done so I can finish more!  Maybe you could try that if it sees not enough to work.  I use Sandoz.	10	October 11, 2020	20
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for Narcolepsy	I was switched to Adderall but after 2 years switched to Ritalin. Adderall seems to open up parts of your brain best left closed. I started to see a 12 year old boy in the yard during the day he would be gone when I went to talk with him. My neighbors told me that in the 1970s he died here. You have to watch the dosage	10	October 10, 2020	26
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for Narcolepsy	I have been soooo sleepy for the past 15 years of my life. I finally found a PA that listened to me about my sleepiness. She has been great. I can not afford the recommended sleep study. I am currently taking 10mg extended release. It has helped but I am still falling asleep at work. My PA will meet with me in after a month on it. I’m not sure if I need an increased dosage or if it’s not working on me. It’s a struggle still. I don’t want to feel hopeless that I can’t find help.	6	October 9, 2020	11
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Adderall XR was originally prescribed to me for ADD, but it worked best as a terrific antidepressant.  However, now that I've been on it for 20 straight years at 40-80 mg. Daily, it has very little antidepressant effect now. It's Adderall burnout -- apparently it strips the brain of dopamine -- the feel-good hormone.        I still have to take it just to do anything at all each day.  The worst effect is insomnia -- no matter how early I take it.  It keeps me up for 24 hours unless I finally have to take Seroquel for sleep.  Seroquel is the only thing that will knock out Adderall XR.  But I hate it because it makes me so damn sluggish in the morning, awful.        I cannot believe it's 2020, and there is still no decent antidep medication available,	8	October 1, 2020	31
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	The last 9 months generic “Zydus” was the only brand of amphetamine/dextroamphetamine available in my area. I noticed pretty nasty side effects beginning 45 minutes after consumption. I’ve never felt depression so severely before taking Zydus. Teva/Barr has returned. Felt a night and day difference the first day. Hope Zydus gets banned for the safety of us all.	1	September 23, 2020	20
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Stressed and depressed and always angry.	7	September 21, 2020	23
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Mydayis (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I switched over to Mydayis in hope of finding something that could last the entire day. My days are usually nonstop for approx 16 hours. I started at the lowest dose and went up to the 50mg after 3 weeks. Gave it a few more weeks in hopes that it would work like how we wanted it to. The negative side effects outweigh the positives. The first thing I noticed was ejaculatory anhedonia. It led to an unplanned pregnancy before I caught it. The rest included falling behind in classes and not being able to keep up at work. Felt lazy and not wanting to do anything. It was like being unmedicated all over again!	4	September 21, 2020	8
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine)	I am so confused but feeling better just knowing I am not alone. I am very sensitive to any changes in medication. I have been on 10 mg twice daily for about 10 months. The pharmacy has switched generic brands multiple times. I did well on one made by Sun Industries but am not doing well on Teva. Apparently they make the name brand which I didn’t know until tonight. I would also like to know how we can change the way generics are approved. The variations are laughable and can really cause problems. I’m hesitant to switch to a different generic because what always happens is they stop making it or the pharmacy can’t get it. I requested name brand so at least it’s consistent. Any suggestions? So frustrated! Best to you all.	7	September 21, 2020	41
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for Narcolepsy	This medicine is god send. I have been suffering with narcolepsy for about 5 years. Had no idea what I was doing wrong that I cannot keep my eye open. I am talking about sleeping for 8-9 hours and then waking up and wanting to go back to sleep. I am a public school teacher and I had no choice but to be at work all day. That was a struggle and I was embarrassed to even tell my coworkers. This summer, so many unpleasant events happened in my life, I decided to talk to my psychiatrist about unable to concentrate and the excessive sleeping pattern. He wanted me to try adderall and bam!! I haven’t taken a nap since August . I do not have any side effects, not glittery, no overworking , nothing. Just ready to start the day and get in with my life. I usually go to bed around 9:30pm and sleeps well. I take 20 mg twice a day. But if you miss a dose, back to square one. I am religiously on a schedule and take them at the same time everyday. I am in my mid 40’s.	10	September 17, 2020	38
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Generic Adderall:  TEVA vs. ALVOGEN “All generic adderall is NOT the same trust me!...... I don’t care what your physician or pharmacist may say.“  I’ve taken Adderall for nearly 25 plus years for ADD.  WHY? it works twice as good ask anyone whose taken different brands before. For the BEST quality and most potent adderall on the market is made by a company called TEVA.  Even pharmacist tell me when they run out of TEVA and must use ALVOGEN their patients complain because the pharmacies cannot keep TEVA in stock because the consumers know it’s the best and most effective for ADD and ADHD.	1	September 15, 2020	131
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have taken both Adderall and its generic(amphetamine/dextroamphetamine) for over 16 years for my Adult Attention Deficit Disorder. I have found that the original Adderall has the best effectiveness and in these last 4 tears Teva [still oval, peach/orange color] working the best for my A.D.D. Pills made by Mallinkrodt I only get by mistake, and still act like a placebo in May 2020. Dose: 20mg. X 2 daily.		August 25, 2020	24
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I do not like this formula. I have been on various generics for years and did not feel like this 10 mg did anything. Unfortunately, I've already filled this prescription and am stuck with this medication.	1	August 24, 2020	7
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been taking Adderall for most of my adult life and Walgreens always carried the generic version that worked best for me but recently they changed who they get it from now and the new amphetamine / dextroamphetamine from Lannett MFG SUCK!  They do not work at all - actually the worst next to the  YELLOW ROUND Mp 447's, PINK ROUND Cor 136's, or OCTAGON WHITE ONES.   The TEVA amphetamine/dextroamphetamine Peach Oval B 974's are the ones that work best for me and now I don' t know how to get them - Help..	10	June 16, 2020	93
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	My concern in taking generic Adderall IR for several years is the effect is has on my heart  When I take it, at the prescribed dose,  I most always have sinus tachycardia  (a heart rate above 100 beats per minute)  I also have noticed that it effects bladder emptying....and my urinary stream seems slower (and I am fairly young) and I am not usually able to completely empty my bladder.	6	June 10, 2020	26
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Since the shortage for about 3 months I've been taking generic Zydus 20mg. How do these drugs pass inspection? I think a couple pixie sticks would work better. I wonder if generic adderall from any manufacturer will ever get better. I think charging over $5.00 for this rubbish should be criminal.	1	June 7, 2020	40
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	This medication amphetamine/dextroamphetamine has made me feel VERY JITTERY and sick to my stomach! I take generic TEVA brand orange tab 30 mg. The pharmacy didn’t have any of the TEVA brand so they gave me generic U31 tablet - Aurolife Pharma, LLC brand. This is horrible! People take time off work to be seen by doctor, get put on meds for a reason, spend money for the appointment and meds, all the time you spend doing this & it can’t be returned back to Walmart to get my right medicine because “it’s against the law” supposedly! Even when I have the entire prescription (minus one) to give them back. Why make people feel like this when they do so much to try and make life easier being on their meds. I don’t have insurance so my doc visit is almost $100 & medicine is around $60 every month. My 7 year old daughters meds were switched as well. I’m scared to even give her medicine! How can Walmart just give you a different brand that you’ve never taken and not tell me before I leave it’s different!?	1	June 5, 2020	67
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Fatigue	I have been through about all anti-depressants, mood stabilizers, and anti-psychotics for my severe treatment-resistant depression and this medicineamphetamine/dextroamphetamine has saved me. Honestly, I have horrible anxiety as well. I have Chronic PTSD and Generalized Anxiety Disorder. This medicine calms my nerves as well. I can actually take naps during the day now when I need to instead of not being able to rest. It helps my impulsiveness from my Bipolar Disorder that is included in my Schizoaffective diagnosis. I may have to deal with the hallucinations but this medicine is the only medicine that works for me in the most positive way. For me, it has way less severe side effects than any medicine I have tried. It mainly helps with my energy levels which helps my depression because I feel more useful I also am more social which helps my confidence. The only thing I struggle with is the lack of appetite and it seems like water goes right through me. But, It is definitely a life saver for me. <3	10	May 3, 2020	32
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I am a male in my thirties. Adderall is the third drug I tried to tread ADHD after doing trials on Vyvanse and Concerta. Vyvanse worked but did not last long enough and I had bad crashing (headache, exhaustion). Concerta did not work for me at all, made me lethargic and even more distracted.  Adderall at 20mg a day gives me energy to focus on work and my kids. It lasts me until sometime in the evening. I have trouble sleeping some nights on it, other than that the side effects are negligible.	8	May 3, 2020	43
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Activist Dextramp-amphet ER (30 mg.) [ generic for Adderall ]  is HORRIBLE. NOT effective. Causes nausea. HORRIBLE. I have taken this drug for over 3 years and I know what it is supposed to do.	1	April 30, 2020	40
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for Narcolepsy	Generic Adderall is not the same. I feel immediately awful when I realize they switched me to generic dextro amp (amp salts works not sure what brand. I heard Teva might have moved distribution centres and have been alternating approved cheaper alternative ingredients. Well guess what they don’t work AT ALL. Check the generic brands when you get your script filled and see how you feel. The old generic brand I took worked just fine. I cannot get out of bed for weeks because whatever “similar” generic cheap alternatives they are using do not make the cut. Welcome back debilitating fatigue!	6	April 12, 2020	129
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Adderall is very useful but recently I was ignorant and thought it would be okay to take a little extra at night to help clean my house. I took a bigger extra dose then I should have and a few hours later I felt pretty awful. I am very productive and more positive on the right dose of this med, so I recommend trying it or Desoxyn, because it is said to have fewer side effects like anxiety and panic and irritability post dose. Like all meds, Adderall is a blessing when dosed right and a curse when dosed incorrectly. I noticed that I paced around a bit when on it but I didn’t feel that anxious. It isn’t fun and enjoyable to take a big dose, don’t do it. God made everything to be used in moderation and it is much better for the whole society when we obey the wise instructions of our doctors and leaders. Be careful, obey your doctor, and may God bless you all to succeed in your treatment plans and in your lives. Amen	8	March 18, 2020	74
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	These batches have to improve. I can't even focus on anything and have narcolepsy.	1	March 10, 2020	35
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Recently changed pharmacies and didn't realize that there can be quite a difference between generics. For 4 years I’ve taken adderall 2x day, 10 mg. Never any problems until I switched pharmacies to save $.  Elite Pharma is who makes this new one and it is NOT GOOD.   I am lethargic, unable to focus, quite sleepy.  It’s as if I haven’t even taken anything.  Incredibly frustrating as I am not even half way through this months supply.	1	March 7, 2020	50
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	The generic manufacturer of amphetamine & dextroamphetamine, Sandoz, is the only one that works for me. This month the manufacturer is Northstar and last month Aurobindo, and they are garbage. They don’t help AT ALL with my focus. Zero.  I am irritable. I am getting nothing done and my anxiety is sky high. I am going to stop taking these brands and ask pharmacy for Sandoz.  I complained to the FDA and urge others to do so as well. This is ridiculous.	1	March 3, 2020	70
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Adderall has worked great for me when taken as needed. When I was in my early 20’s and taking it daily I built up a dependence that lead to terrible withdrawals as it is very addictive. (Learned the hard way and never want to go through that again!)  I will usually only take this when my ADHD symptoms are unbearable and my work/personal life starts to become affected. We are talking maybe 1-4 tablets max per month.  It really does help with focus and energy, and I find that one 10-20mg dose is usually enough and I feel good for several days after the dose without any withdrawals or dependence issues.

ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Laura, CVS in Kansas City and probably elsewhere exclusively carry SANDOZ. With goodrx my 60 tablets of 20mg are 28$	9	February 22, 2020	32
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	If you're taking for ADHD please note there are a lot of side effects, having said this, they are sometimes serious so take note to talk to your doctor. If you get cold fingers or toes, make sure to consult your doctor as it's a syndrome that can be prevented.  It does help with focus, it helps with impulse control, it helps with a general overall euphoric feeling and it can cause you to lose a lot of weight. Be sure to eat, EAT, don't shake your head, you know I'm talking to you. Eat and stay hydrated it causes you to urinate a LOT, make sure to supplement what you are losing. It will cause tremors, shakes, and irritability, again, eat food. Make sure to stick to a 2000 calorie diet AT LEAST. May cause muscle fatigue and extreme soreness, stay hydrated, make sure of this.  Some say it causes better grades in school, well, to an extent. It just makes you write a lot. Eat Eat Hydrate And maybe take melatonin to help promote rest. I warned and entertained you.	7	February 21, 2020	97
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	My daughter developed tardive dyskinesia, a permanent drug-induced movement disorder, while on Adderall. If your kid has ODD, stay away from all stimulates; they are most at-risk.	1	February 19, 2020	26
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I totally agree that the new A 79 generics are no good.  I mean they work a little bit, but I feel taking the same amount of the other oblong orange ones that taste like sweet we’re way better.  These taste like nasty chalk.    I’ve never had adderal brand though so I wouldn’t that difference.	3	February 19, 2020	25
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I have been on  adderal 15mg 2×daily  for 7 yrs it has completely change my life.  I  was always down, depressed, unmotivated, impulsive, always day dreaming, short attention span, no focus and couldn't sitting still. Adderal has given me a new happy life that I can enjoy and appreciate. Starting to think I need to go up to 20mg. I can feel I'm getting used to them. But without them I wouldn't get out of bed and would waste my life.I  think adderal is my miracle drug I have never been so grateful for a prescription drug	10	February 17, 2020	111
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I was diagnosed with ADHD combined type and have tried Ritalin and Focalin. Both weren't that great for me so my doctor prescribed me 10 mg of Adderall XR. Adderall has made me have better multitasking skills and helped me pay attention. It hasn't really helped with being hyper or being impulsive and has given me bad twitching eyes. It also has made my sleep schedule weird so watch out for that.	6	February 6, 2020	23
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Picked up amphetamine with dextroamphetamine medicine 1/24/20, bottle said Barr brand? But Teva tabs were inside. Teva bought Barr in 07. Before Teva bought out multiple companies and started using their ingredients within the last 2-3 years, they were great. Sandoz and Corepharma have been the only other decent makers, before they were bought out. I haven’t noticed a thing from picking these up 1/24. The worst medicine I’ve had from Teva in 8 years.	1	February 4, 2020	36
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	On 1/24/2020 I received Teva generic IR Adderall like I usually have for the last 7 years off and on (used to be good.) Except Barr was labeled on the bottle for the first time ever. Not sure why since Teva bought Barr in 07. Regardless it isn’t any better, by far the worst I’ve had of Teva. But every other company is pathetic. Brand works 10X better but 10X pricier. If the FDA enforced the rule of not less than 80% and no more than 125% concentrated effectiveness, that would be a first! The right MG of each dose might be regulated, but the fillers/inactive ingredients added is the big issue. 1-3 used to be in the old Barr/ Shire/ Sandoz/ Core and those worked fantastic. Every generic now has 5-8 fillers that make it less effective but also cause severe side effects. FDA could care less about small market drugs.	1	February 3, 2020	50
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Game changer. First DX by A pdoc: ADHD. What, no?  Yes.  I felt like I was only working with one puzzle piece and finding out about ADHD was like being given the other 999 pieces. At first Adderall IR didn’t seem to do much but I slowly realized it was like putting emotional and mental blinders on where I could see the rest of the world but mainly focus on the task at hand. Job saver for sure.  Since I have a high tolerance to meds XR saved me from constantly trying to remember to take next dose when I started crashing. Tops.	10	February 3, 2020	30
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I have found the generic brand for Adderall is not effective as the brand name. The Epic brand caused me to have severe depression, blurred vision, headaches, very tired and no focus at all.  I’m trying to find a brand that is much like the name brand. Looking for suggestions if anyone can share please. Thanks	1	January 29, 2020	95
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I went to pharmacy to pick up my Adderall generic brand Zydus. I was told they was out of my brand. I was given the Epic brand. The Epic brand caused me to have severe depression and I stayed in bed, I’ve always been very energetic. I stopped taking it. I called the Pharmacist and reported the side effects I had. Pharmacist didn’t act surprised at all, stated we are out of your regular brand and probably won’t get it back in.	1	January 28, 2020	18
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Generics make me feel ill, sometimes headache, sometimes itching or hives.  Google where generics are made.	1	January 24, 2020	45
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	"I was so glad to see these posts.  Pharmacies are so rude to me. I switched to so many brands, but they say they are all alike, and say it doesn't matter which generic I get, because they're all the same.  My doctor, unfortunately, thinks the same.  I finally said to the pharmacy tech one day, ""I'm sure I'm not the only one, who would like certain generics."" She said, no, I'm the only one. I know this sounds crazy, but the blue 10mg of teva, don't seem to work like the 15mg of the peach teva, even if I cut one of the blue in half to make it 15mg."	8	January 23, 2020	90
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I was taking 15mg of generic Adderall  amphetamine / dextroamphetamine  for 3 months and by the end of the 3rd month I had 3 separate people tell me I didn't seem myself. I'm a regularly joyful and excited person but every emotion I had felt muted or stunted while on amphetamine/dextroamphetamine. I stopped talking it and 3 days later felt so much better. I was joyful again! Back to pinging all over the place but at least I'm happy doing it lol. I'm trying Concerta next.	4	January 21, 2020	3
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Ok so I have Both Narcolepsy/Extreme Fatigue & ADD. The generic forms of Adderall (amphetamine and dextroamphetamine) seem to be getting worse and worse. They are making them with obviously cheaper so-called similar ingredients but the new generic amphetamine and dextroamphetamine drugs just have bad side effects and don’t work for me at all or are far less effective. I don’t know if it is Teva brand that is making these cheap ineffective knock-offs that cause migraines & other side effects but they are definitely not working or decent. The generic form Amphetamine Salts works just fine for me but again I think when Teva took over and apparently used far cheaper Ingres there is definitely a disconnect because I don’t think Dextroamp-Amphetamin is a worthy generic form of Adderall but maybe just because Teva brand seems to be using incredibly cheap ingredients,	10	January 20, 2020	21
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Mydayis (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I've had ONE DOSE.  Let me be clear.  I took one 25mg pill 6 hours ago and I'm so sleepy I can't see straight.  I slept 7.5 hours last night so I don't understand the drowsiness.	5	January 9, 2020	33
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’ve been on adderall for a few years now and it was life changing. I’ve always been prescribed a generic and have never had a problem until recently. I noticed that I was not getting the same benefit as I was previously and for months, tried to convince myself that it was in my head and then one month, I noticed everyday that I felt great! Looked at the pill imprint and what do you know - it was a different manufacture (Amneal) than the one I was taking. I started googling it and saw a lot of complaints for generic Adderall from Global Pharmaceutical. I’m talking to pharmacist today about it and requesting the generic by Amneal Pharmaceuticals. I thought they were all the same and it’s a shame that global can make these any less effective than what they should be. Is it so people go to their dr, say they don’t feel the effects of it and get an increase? Sounds like a big pharma thing to do. Trust your gut instinct because you’re the person who knows you best.	1	January 8, 2020	17
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for Narcolepsy	I have #IdiopathicHypersomnia & #narcolepsy. Not all generics are equal  1. #Corepharma works 2. Oval, peach #Teva does not  3. Teva started carrying same dark pink, round IR as #Corepharma  4. In 2018 Teva selling the oval, peach again 5. I filled the Rx with #Sandoz (round, peach) worked almost as well 6. Corepharma was purchased by #Epic.  7. I have been relying on Sandoz since 2018  Every month I have to call pharmacies see if Sandoz is in stock. Usually they don't have it & can't to order it. #JewelOsco is the ONLY pharmacy that places orders for me.   Today (01/05/2020), JewelOsco does not have any &  unable to place an order; the supplier is out & the date available is TBD  Has anyone tried #Northstar? How does it compare to Sandoz?  How is the pharmaceutical industry allowed to do this? If anyone reading this can point me in the direction to hold pharmaceutical companies legally accountable, please comment  *Aurobino does not work for me  #NarcolepsyDiscrimination	9	January 5, 2020	71
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	"I recently was given this new form of adderall from the pharmacy which was circular with just an ""A"" on one side... I did not like this new form of Adderall at all!! I assumed it would have the same effect as the typical oval shaped and it was completely different which is a little scary. It was very bitter and gross tasting unlike the football shaped one has a sweet note. It also disintegrated turning to powder immediately, as I attempted to break it in half (waste of product). I did not get any focus from it nor did I feel any different at all?? It did nothing! Then the next day got a horrible headache! I was talking with a friend who also mentioned getting the same thing recently. He mentioned having an extremely bad headache too the following day, so we now know it's from this form of adderall. I DO NOT LIKE IT. It should be pulled from the market honestly I don't know what the heck this rubbish  is but it is not adderall."	2	January 2, 2020	79
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Was first diagnosed with ADD(inattentive type) by multiple doctors at 18 years old. Out of the gate they prescribed me 60mg IR amphetamine with dextroamphetamine. I am now 26, taking 80mg/day, and have learned a substantial amount about this drug. No it won't make you any smarter or develop hidden talents, most believe this. The generic (dextroamphetamine-amphetamine IR) is cheaper than its brand (Adderall xr.) Obviously brand is set to higher standards of quality than generics, so yes brand name anything works better than generics, it's common sense. If you use it correctly and find the right manufacturer like Teva, you most likely won't find as many negatives as most people.	8	December 30, 2019	9
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I’ve been taking the generic version of Adderall for about 2 years now. I was tired all the time and couldn’t focus. I felt like a slug and when I had energy I still had brain fog, and had a hard time studying. In class, I would fidget in my chair, doodle, and listen to lectures, but nothing would stick in my head. No matter how long I studied.  I was prescribed the 7.5 mg tablet once a day and just the small dose did wonders for my energy levels and let me focus and actually get things done. It helped me talk in social situations and gave me a mood boost.  That being said, The generics changed a couple times. And I’m not sure, but I think I can tell a difference between them. After the pill wears off, my head aches, my legs throb, my body aches, and I’m nauseous and feel sick. I have flu like symptoms, which are miserable. It’s sad because it’s a really small dose and helps me so much but some of the side effects suck. You just gotta see what’s worth it to you.	8	December 24, 2019	61
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Fatigue	"This drug has absolutely saved my life. I have been diagnosed with severe CFS and depression approximately 14 years ago.  In 2015, I had my thyroid removed due to cancer, so I am on artificial thyroid. I could have slept for 20 hours a day and it wouldn't have been enough. I tend not to take it on weekends, as I don't need to be as ""awake"" as when I'm at work. I typically end up sleeping 12-14 hours straight on the days I don't take it. I would not be able to work full-time without Adderall. I have taken 30 mg for several years now and it has worked well for me; I have a hunch that it's because I don't generally take it on weekends, so my body gets that ""mini detox"" from it every week.   Really. This drug has saved my life. I can function again!"	10	December 5, 2019	24
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	This medication does not work at all now.	1	December 2, 2019	49
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for Narcolepsy	I was diagnosed with a sleep disorder/excessive daytime sleepiness and my physician prescribed me Adderall. After I found the dose that worked best for me (30mg in the morning and 10-20mg in the afternoon) I felt like a new person. I usually sleep anywhere from 12-18 hours a day when I don’t have classes or work (I don’t have to force myself up on these days with 2 alarms). I can still nap but they are not nearly as long as they used to be (3-8 hours). My grades have improved and most importantly, my attendance of class has improved! I used to sleep through class, but now I can go because my body isn’t begging for sleep. Overall it is an extremely helpful drug to treat narcolepsy/excessive daytime sleepiness. I finally feel like I have my life back! My only complaint is the dry mouth I experience every so often. I also still feel rather tired some days but it is not as NEAR as torturous as it used to be. Overall, it is extremely helpful and it has changed my life for the better.	10	November 20, 2019	54
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Not very effective; I took a  double dose which cause headaches and made me generally feel ill.  There are  better generics. Company should not be allowed to sell this medication.	1	November 17, 2019	13
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been on Adderal 10 mg for three months now. I have found it helps me so much in the morning. I need to talk to my doctor and see if I can get something for the afternoon. It's been a godsend but I don't have any anger issues just a lot of anxiety. I'm on Xanax as well three times a day and Ambien for sleep which really helps bed by 5 clock I'm wore out. And then my symptoms seem to return. I would recommend this to anyone that has concentration issues. I'm 41 years old and when I went to school they always called you slow. Which always made you look bad. I think my doctor he's wonderful and I'm going to get my Xanax upped and see if I can get something for the afternoon due to that I work many hours a day and I have to be on my toes.	9	November 2, 2019	6
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I got diagnosed with ADHD at the beginning of this school year, being my senior year of high school. Since 8th grade, I've struggled in school, been incredibly impulsive, had very strange eating habits, over-thought everything, and could never contain my anger or anxiety. Once prescribed, my life has changed. My grades went up, and in 3 months I've lost almost 30 pounds (I am still in the normal BMI range). I can control myself. I finally believe in myself because of Adderall.	9	October 29, 2019	79
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Well been on and off Adderall or Ritalin since I was 5. I'm 62 now, and take 60mg XR morning and two 30mg IR in the afternoon. For me it's a Godsend. I can pay attention now,  I'm more sociable, I'm just.......me.	8	October 23, 2019	22
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I’m 48 yo woman that was diagnosed with ADHD in elementary.  When I began (on holiday) taking it I’m extremely fatigue/zombie the first 3 days, I am not nearly as engaged with anyone/anything around me (I talk 97% less when I’m on Adderall) and it makes me feel less cognitive.  I feel like it dumbs me down.  After the 3rd day I start to feel better and those “tranquilizer effects” go away. Adderall is an emotional regulator for me. It works wonders for my impulsivity, racing thoughts, fidgeting, feeling overwhelmed, anger, anxiety, zoning out, and my mouth. Yes, my mouth has always been my biggest challenge and has caused me tremendous social/professional problems.  While in a perfect world I’d be on no medication, I have to recommend Adderall for anyone whose suffering from ADHD, because  it has changed my overall quality of life for the best.  Sparkle on beautiful people! 	9	October 23, 2019	81
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I was diagnosed with both bipolar and ADHD. After trying multiple combinations, we finally tried adderall on top of Wellbutrin, Lamictal, and Fluvoxamine for OCD. At first, the adderall did wonders. Completely made me enjoy life again. However, as my tolerance increased, the adderall crash was very intense. It resulted in a bipolar low almost everyday around the same time. I recently just switched to Stratetta and is my second day taking it. Anxious to see how this works.	9	October 22, 2019	29
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Mydayis (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I’ve been taking meds for ADHD/ADD close to 8 years now.  Tried Adderall at many dosages, types and amount of times per day over a period of many years.  My biggest issue. I forgot to take them.  Tried Vyvanse. It helped but I got nauseous, dizzy every day.  Tried Adderall again and forgot to take them.  One day my doctor mentioned Mydayis. I wouldn’t have to remember taking more than one in the AM.  After a week I could tell that it was helpful but wasn’t able to tell if a BIG difference.  I ran out due to scheduling once & my brain went into hyper drive. I hadn’t felt that chaotic for awhile.  WHILE talking to my doctor she legit wrote out the prescription, handed it to me. ‘go fill it NOW.’ Even had others asking how long I would be without it.  It was clear it helped at that point.  I don’t notice any side effects.  My results with Mydayis are pretty good. No worries of forgetting it, which was the major factor in my switch.	8	October 20, 2019	11
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Mydayis (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I'm making this review one year after trying Mydayis for only a week. I switched to this drug from Adderall IR 20's BID to the 37mg capsule, you don't really think your buzzing, but you indeed are, and more so than with Adderall for the same dose. What prompted me to write this review was that I noticed someone else who reviewed this mentioned that they would be returning the bottle to the pharmacy because they didn't want insurance to think they were keeping it. This is an effect of the drug, I too, even though I bought it on the $5 coupon, did not want the pharmacy (who does not care) to think that I wanted to keep this drug so I returned the remaining 23 capsules to them. It works well, puts you in a different state of mind, and doesn't provide the sense well being of some other ADHD products offer, but it does work better than some generics. Perhaps give this a try if you're on generics that don't work. It is pretty strong, but doesn't feel like it. if that makes sense.	7	October 14, 2019	12
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I was on 10MG XR for 3 months and it worked amazingly. This is a very good medication if you have trouble functioning like a normal person, although be prepared for really dark thoughts if you decide to stop taking it. Withdrawal from this drug is no joke, it can make you want to die...but if you keep taking it or taper off slowly you should be fine.		October 12, 2019	22
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I was diagnosed with ADD in 2005 after experiencing horrible distractibility in class while at college and not being able to focus on a single thought in my head.  I was prescribed Adderall IR and I remember feeling like I had drunk 5 Red Bulls or something!  My heart was pounding and I had horrible anxiety the whole day.  I only took it one time.  I decided to get off it immediately.  Soon after, I was prescribed Strattera, which didn't do ANYTHING.  I've gone for about 13 years without actual ADD medications because I really hated the idea of stimulants.  That all changed when I realized my ADD was getting out of control.  I saw my current psychiatrist last week who re-diagnosed me and we discussed my experiences.  I had read reviews from people here who say that Dexedrine works for them if Adderall made them too wired, so I asked if I could try that.  I just tried it today and I had no horrible side effects - no anxiety, no heart palpitations, no edginess, etc.  It is wonderful!	1	October 9, 2019	21
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for Narcolepsy	I was recently diagnosed with Narcolepsy in early 2019. I was started on Adderrall, but it took about 6 months to get the regimen that worked for me. I was quite sick at the stomach for about 3 months with nausea, and headaches. I take 30 mg at 9 am, and 10 mg at 1 pm. Finally, it's working well to a certain degree.  I still need at least two naps during the day and have most of my energy in the morning and early afternoon. Come 7-8 pm, I'm literally exhausted. I realized how well the medication worked after I missed a dose. I wondered why I was yawning all day and barely able to stay awake. It was because I had forgotten to take my Adderrall. Despite how well it works, I still seem to yawn almost constantly. I would not be able to get through the day without it. It's not 100 percent fix, but I can function for most of the day using it. So, that's a plus for me.	9	October 8, 2019	17
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for Narcolepsy	I was originally prescribed for adult ADD. I took it for several weeks with some results, but I soon learned that it was great for a sleep disorder as well. Recently, I stopped taking it, but soon afterward, all I could do was sleep all day. I was extremely fatigued. I had a blood test for hypothyroidism but it was negative. The only side effect for me was hypertension which I take medication for, but lately, it has been elevated. Nothing the doctor can't fix by increasing the dosage of my blood pressure med. I don't plan to stop this mediation unless I need a larger dosage to work. Currently taking Adderall XR 20mg in the morning and regular Adderall  20mg at noon. Moreover, it helps ease my craving for carbs. It works better than any antidepressant.		October 5, 2019	22
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Mydayis (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I have suffered my entire life with ADD.  For a while Adderal helped. Then as I turned 49 it seemed to make me more anxious, irritable,  short tempered, and I had No patience for stupidity! Upon trying the Mydayis,  I was immediately impressed. I was finishing projects.  Getting things done right! Able to focus for longer durations of time. Long enough to complete tasks at hand. I feel so much better.	10	October 3, 2019	30
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I will never give this to my child again!, I know all children are different but I'm sticking with Dyanavel XR. While he was on Adderall he was acting angry and violent, like he was on some kind of illegal drug, his facial expressions were intense, and he could not sit still, and was very emotional. so I have to give this a 1 star on my personal experience and my son's	1	October 2, 2019	35
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I've had a prescription for amphetamine with dextroamphetamine for  four years, and Teva used to work fairly well for me. Over the last year or so, it's become awful. I know it isn't me, because I still have old (2-3 years) pills laying around; I tried some of them and they work just fine.   Teva changed something in the manufacturing process. The new pills do almost nothing beneficial (I feel sleepy all day), but they have a ton of side effects. I feel very jittery, my stomach hurts, and I've been experiencing bloating.	1	September 30, 2019	23
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Overall, 20 mg Adderall XR for ADHD helps me to focus. The problem with adderall is it makes me sweat something awful. Anyone else annoyed with sweating while taking adderall?	9	September 28, 2019	62
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Well first off. Adderall is an Amphetamine  which assist with the production of dopamine. Very close  relation to meth. I am 21 years old and I started Adderall again. Previously I was on Adderall from age 8-13 and it worked great. Some say ADHD is not real and it just a symptom of bad health etc... I have been very very healthy and unhealthy which produced no changed in brain fog. Now that engineering is my main task in like I seem to have a hefty amount of brain fog. Adderall does in fact help with focus but the downside is the extreme crashes that happen when you stop taking it.	8	September 26, 2019	20
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been on Adderall for quite sometime. It has helped me focus and also being proactive. I recently got a new script and diff manufacturing teva  I noticed since I have taken it I'm extremely tired. Cannot focus at all I feel like a scatter brain..I had to call my dr to have him rewrite a new script and surrender the Teva (amphetamine with dextroamphetamine) Did anyone get the same reaction?	1	September 26, 2019	20
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I shared my experience recently on here and was going back over and reading others as well.  I believe we should all state the laboratory that producing the specific generic we are each taking. Doing so may help us all narrow down which ones to stay away from and which ones are truly therapeutic.  Eon lab  brand of amphetamine/dextroamphetamine was good until 9 months ago, now they are horrible (no therapeutic value and bad side effects).  I then I switched to Teva and they were decent for about 2 months and now they are giving me side effects.  Plus the pharmacy ran out of them and I had to wait for a new batch and when the new batch came in is when the bad side effect started.  I KNOW the drug manufacturer has changed something.  Hope that helps someone.	2	September 24, 2019	121
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Narcolepsy	I have been on generic Adderall (dextroamphetamine -amphetamine) for about a year and a half. I have always got the Teva brand with no issues. But in the last couple months I have noticed it not working as well. I just filled my script last week and they are even worse! I keep dozing off at work and back to taking naps in my car on lunch again. It's very frustrating! I take 30mg twice a day for narcolepsy. Last month during to the shortage on 30mg my script was shorted by 9 pills. This time the manufacturer was Alvogen and they were amazing! Only time I came across this manufacturer. I wish my insurance would cover the brand name. They denied me even with my doctor's appeal.	1	September 23, 2019	9
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for Narcolepsy	I have been on D-Amphetamine Salt Combo, 30mg a day for a few months for narcolepsy and actually did great. But I recently picked up another prescription and noticed this brand is called Teva generic brand. I have noticed for 2 weeks I have became irritated, forgetting easily in what I was looking for or talking about, aggressive outbursts, stomach pain, migraines, generalist not feeling good on this brand. I will be complaining over this!	1	September 15, 2019	50
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	So, I have had ADHD since I was like young. I never liked the pills they gave me when I was younger because I was already a thin kid and then taking Adderall I would eat even less. So I stopped taking the medication. When I was taking this medication I got most improved student! I went without the drug for years, until just about 2 years ago I started taking it again and It has helped me so much! I am very thankful for this drug. I suffer from fatigue , and many, many other problems. This drug is one of many I NEED, To Think Straight and to not get outta control.  It also helps me BIG TIME with my anger issues. Hope this helps someone! Star Kid Is OUT!	9	September 11, 2019	47
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	This drug is one of the greatest formulas of all time.

ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I cannot believe that the FDA allows AUROBINDO or TEVA to sale their lousy drugs through pharmacies in the US.  Neither of these generics have any affect on me at all!!  WASTE of money!   They are playing with people's minds and well being!!!!	2	September 6, 2019	109
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Have taken Adderall on and off for around 13 years for ADD and CFS. I was lucky enough to have tried the “real” brand Adderall by Barr laboratories. I’ve never taken over 20mg a day. This medicine has gone to TRASH.The only negative side affect from the Barr version was occasional jaw clinching.   I think Teva must’ve burned the patent formula or something because it has never worked liked the Barr, not even close.  So many negative side effects (migraine headaches, heartburn, nausea)! I keep hoping at some point they might magically start producing a decent version that actually helps instead of hurts.  The original Barr had true therapeutic value.  Eon labs produced a decent generic for a while, but BAM, it suddenly went to garbage at the end of 2018.  So switched back to Teva a couple months back and it started ok( not as good as Eon but better than everything else out there), then last months refill is feeling like they’re changing to something bad too.  Bring back real Adderall!	3	September 4, 2019	78
ACT Amphetamine XR -  30MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I had taken Adderall for many years and was slowly on the decline.  I was deeply depressed and had an absolute hopeless and helpless outlook on life with no relief. I had psychosis, delusions and impulsive behavior which I never had. I began having issues with memory, thinking, reasoning, decision making, tasks, and  concentration.  I would become very agitated if being interrupted. I was very aggressive and agitated constantly, it was at least 98% of the time in 10 years.  I read horror stories about stimulants, namely the Amphetamine line of them. I subsequently tapered off of them and feel 100% better than before. I have no depressive symptoms, delusions, memory problems, agitation or aggressiveness. I was not happy with life and my personal relationships were very toxic. I wasted almost 10 years of my life feeling like this and have other personal complications that resulted from the use of these toxic drugs.	1	August 28, 2019	29
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I have taken Adderall XR and short acting for 25 years and I got this new XR 30MG the other day Lannett and it made me tired, heart racing, BP accelerated and did NOTHING to help me focus. I contacted the pharmacy and my Dr and he's trying to switch me to another brand because this is a joke. awful..	1	April 26, 2021	3
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Just started taking adderall XR 10mg after learning I had been mis-diagnosed for 15+ years as either bi-polar, major depressive disorder and social anxiety. I finally found a psychiatrist that really dug deep and concluded I was not bi polar but I suffered from adult ADHD (33 year old male). It makes total sense as I read more about ADHD. I had been on every possible anti-depressant, anti psychotic MDD etc and was just done with meds. I was diagnosed as a child and teen but thought “ I’d grow out of it” and apparently never did it just got worse. I feel that so many people are mis-diagnosed it’s almost unbelievable. My theory and the doctor also said that if you take the medication and it calms you and your racing thoughts that that’s a tell tail sign that you do indeed suffer from ADHD, it’s not just a childhood/school era problem, it disrupts your life, marriage everything. I’m on day 2 and it’s like a light switch has been turned on and I can relax and not be manic.	9	April 25, 2021	3
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been on and off generic Adderall for many years. Currently, I have been prescribed 30 mg twice a day. For the last couple of months, it's been a nightmare. It's been on backorder and then changed the generic name from amphetamine salts combo to amphetamine/ dextroamphetamine combo. This is only because I have had severe headaches, extreme fatigue, and a loss of motivation. My ADHD has been out of the roof. It's frustrating because I feel like I did before taking any generic Adderall. I have even been concerned that maybe I was receiving a placebo rather than the actual medication. That's probably far-fetched, but it's been such a decline for me. There is something missing from this generic form and it is the essential thing that is needed to control my ADHD. I have even gained a lot of weight over the past two months. Hopefully, something will give, I can't imagine it affecting people like this and nothing changing.	3	April 19, 2021	8
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	This pill does not work like any Adderall that I have experienced. There is neither the focus or the energy bump that is typically associated with the two most therapeutic aspects of the formulation. The vast majority of time I feel equally as sleepy and unfocused as I did when I took it.    I am an experienced user of this positive life-changing medication. The patients that us this medication are in a bad position when company’s that make inferior generic medications are allowed distribution rights through equally as corrupt retail pharmaceutical outlets seeking to make a few pennies extra per script, on the back of patients whose experienced opinion is rarely considered.	2	April 17, 2021	2
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I have taken ADHD meds many years. Adderall XR is the ADHD med that works the best for me. I am taking a generic manufactured by Lannett. It by far has worked the best for me with the reason(s) being is the smoothness, the come up is very quick, and it does it's job perfectly.   To reiterate, Lannett is very smooth with a quick come up, and last long enough most days.	9	April 15, 2021	4
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	If anyone else is having a terrible time with the new Lannett generic adderall you can report this to the FDA.  I have been having crippling headaches, stomach aches, and the medication doesn’t even feel like it works!!! I get tired after I take it and then can’t sleep all night because of it. HORRIBLE. Google fda medwatch online reporting to fill in the form	1	April 9, 2021	33
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Right now I take 50mg Lamictal for my Bipolar and 7.5mg twice a day Adderall for ADHD. At first I wasn't sure Adderall was going to work for me, I was initially prescribed 20mg twice a day.  That dose ended up being way too high for me, It made be become manic and I felt really wired all the time.  I now take 7.5mg twice a day and have found it to be much better. I feel alert and focused throughout the day.  Some of the side effects I have had are weight loss, jaw clenching, and mild insomnia (I usually just take melatonin). Overall, Adderall has helped me a lot, I just had to find the right dosage.	8	April 8, 2021	0
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been on Adderall for several years and the Sandoz brand is TOXIC and HORRIBLE! At first it is like a sugar pill no effect and then dizziness, headache, feeling more confused, spaced out and mind blank, extreme fatigue. I can't believe this is on the market. FDA honestly needs to step up their game and monitor the generics. It is a up and down roller coaster with different manufactures each month. This is insane. They are robbing us blind in the pharmaceutical business. They give us something toxic or a placebo. What is happening to the medications now. Please do not take the Sandoz. Read the court documents about reviews on them and they came from the company. Making themselves sound great as a pretend customer!! I can not believe how bad this medication from this manufacture is.	1	April 6, 2021	10
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Worked really well for the first week or so, but then really made me more irritable and gave me uncontrollable suicidal urges that ultimately sent me to the hospital. The suicidal urges stopped after dropping the medication.  I wouldn't recommend against the medication, I would just proceed with caution as the side effects can vary in intensity from person to person.	1	April 3, 2021	3
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I have been prescribed Amphetamine Salt Combo which has worked well(I have ADD and narcolepsy). Today I was given from RX, Amphetamine Aspertate, it make me fell kinda sickness. Was I given the wrong medicine. The prescription has not changed ?	7	April 1, 2021	3
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I’ve been on Adderrall immediate release for at least 8 years, probably more. At first Adderrall gave me an intense high and made me very talkative. Very talkative. That lasted for a few days and after that each morning when I took it it gave me a euphoric feeling for about have the day. I wasn’t making impulsive decisions like I had in the past and my focus was razor sharp. I really enjoyed this drug for sometime but the last 3-5 years it’s just been the same old same old. I take it in the morning and have somewhat of a boost in energy and focus but after around 11am the effects of the medication just wears off. I wind up feeling irritable, decent level of focus if I’m busy at work, and just downright not very social with people. This week I’m going to see my P.A. and hopefully get on Vyvanse which I was encouraged by many to try before jumping on Adderrall. Vyvanse is more expensive but I’m ready to feel more focused and more myself.	5	March 28, 2021	4
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	This review is for generic Adderall XR - amphetamine/dextroamphetamine. I've experienced wildly different effects from different manufacturers. Some days it didn't work. Some days it worked great. But I got severe debilitating headaches that lasted 24/7 and didn't go away using ibuprofen. Went to neurologist and got an MRI. If I could push past the side effects it did work well but for only about 4-5 hours after kicking in (which took about an hour). Needed a booster of IR in the afternoon, so eventually I couldn't deal with the headaches and switched to IR completely. Headaches gone almost immediately. I still get them with IR but not anywhere near as often or as bad.	6	March 23, 2021	1
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Mydayis (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	"I've tried several ADHD meds and Mydayis has definitely been the best for me. I'm on the lowest dose and it starts working 20-30 minutes after I take it. I'm then able to be productive and direct my focus easily, compared to other meds (eg-Adderall) which gave me a burst of intense focus that I had no control over. The transitions are barely noticeable and it really helps maintain consistent energy levels. After wearing off, it's a very natural ""I've worked all day and now I'm ready to relax before bed"" feeling (no crash). I also noticed it significantly helps manage my depression-something no other ADHD med has done. The only downsides: (1) it does reduce my appetite a lot and (2) it only lasts about 9-10 hours on my current dose (12.5mg), but higher doses (25mg+) give me headaches. It's not perfect, but the positives definitely outweigh the negatives for me. Lastly-you don't know how it'll affect you, so don't let reviews scare you away if you/your doc think it might help."	9	March 21, 2021	4
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I was diagnosed with ADHD at age 17 and only really started taking stimulant medication after I had turned 20 last year. I was originally trying out varying doses of IR but started trying XR in the past few months.  Overall: Hit or miss for me. It does help with my focus, but the side effects and how much it helps varies pretty drastically depending on the day. Biggest side effects are dehydration, lack of appetite, potentially crashing at night (normal). I also feel a bit uncomfortable sometimes (anxiety-ish twitchy feeling) but that's not very common.  The mallinckrodt brand I was switched to recently seems maybe a bit more hit or miss honestly I can't really tell that much of a difference (unlike people on opioids who swear that mallinckrodt is awful). I'm on 25mg for now and I'm gonna keep seeing how I feel in the coming weeks. Helps with ADHD no doubt, but do be weary of the side effects.	7	March 16, 2021	2
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Mydayis (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I took Mydayis 37.5 mg for 2 years. I just recently ran out and decided to wait a week to refill. I cannot believe the change in myself! While on it I became withdrawn and too focused on 1 specific thing. I cut out people and ruined my small business. I didn't feel human! I can't explain the feeling but now that I haven't taken it in a week I feel like myself again! I was just flesh living day by day on mydayis! I will NEVER touch it again! Please tell me there's others out there with similar experiences	1	March 12, 2021	5
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	"I have been taking teva 20mg adderall from 06-19 when they disappeared. I had already suffered from side effects from other generics due to CVS giving me a different generic a few times without consent or being informed. I did the whole google wormhole for a few months before finally seeing a random comment about ""INACTIVE"" ingredients and how this person suffered terrible side effects across multiple generic medications with this same ""INACTIVE"" ingredient. Being on multiple meds myself and having autoimmune and neuro disorders it affected my mental health knowing something wasn't right and just not grasping why & not understanding. That random comment changed everything for me ""INACTIVE"" does not equal no effect.  Teva not being an option then and now not at all I use Mallinckrodt and Arubindo 20 mg. I find it helps to switch them every couple months or I take M in the morning and A in the afternoon depending on how my body is functioning. I tried SAndoz that was terrible side effects."	8	March 6, 2021	2
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Narcolepsy	I've been on adderall 20 mg 3× a day for over 10 years from secondary narcolepsy due to a TBI. I will only take Teva there plenty of generics that don't work and are less than a 10% out of 100% I got these I think Mallinckrodt U30 on it I tried returning it after taking 3 and falling asleep they wouldn't return so I took about 7 more just to get home from the pharmacy 1hour drive without passing out it did nothing. If I took 4 Teva I'd bounce off the walls won't sleep for at least 1 day. I will never again take anything besides the Teva after sleeping for the remainder of the month. I wish I could afford the brand name. Don't listen to any pharmacist generic aren't close I can't believe they get away with saying there same as brand lol body doesn't lie. Scumbags looking for profit due not caring who suffers	9	March 5, 2021	5
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	My 7 year old son is a first grader and was recently diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. He has been recommended Adderall for this but I am a bit reluctant to initiate its usage. I have a few reservations about how long it lasts in our system which I have heard can prove to be dangerous for a young kid. I have read multiple articles like these, but I am still not so sure. Seeing the number of experienced people here, please tell me if I should continue with it.		March 4, 2021	4
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	First time taking Alvogen generic amphetamine with dextroamphetamine 30mg. Been taking adderall for 2 years but always Teva generic. Oh my God, the Alvogen brand has made me feel so sick. All over severe headache, nauseous, vomiting, diarrhea. I feel awful. No focus, no energy, can't keep anything down, running to the bathroom.	1	February 27, 2021	8
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Been taking adderall for years. Until the had me try a white stop sign shaped one by mallinckrodt since there was an adderall shortage at my Walgreens. mallinckrodt amphetamine/dextroamphetamine shouldn’t even be labeled as amphetamine/dextroamphetamine it should just be sold as a caffeine pill because all it does is wake you up subtlety. It doesn’t help with focus whatsoever. I’ve already filed a complaint with the FDA and recommend everyone else do the same	1	February 25, 2021	20
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I take the 10 mg amphetamine with dextroamphetamine by Teva and it works great, better than the 15 mg.in my opinion. I see others mentioning generics by Alogen and Mallinckrodt here. Well I take a couple of other medications manufactured by these 2, on and off, most times it's Mallickrodt. Let me tell you, this is the WORST drug manufacturer on the market. The Alogen is junk too. I've been on a few medical chat sites just to see what I can find out about Mallinckrodt and see if others felt the same way and they absolutely do! Literally 100's of people have complained to the co. itself and to the FDA. This has been going on for a solid 5 years at least & the stuff is STILL pure unadulterated JUNK.	7	February 21, 2021	23
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Mydayis (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Switched from Concerta to Mydayis for the longer duration mechanism Mydayis offers. Was started on 25mg of Mydayis. ADD symptoms improved but I experienced dry mouth, dizziness, heart increase, and appetite decrease which subsided after the first week. Second week I felt like the dose was not effective. Doc switched me to 37.5mg of the mydayis and so far symptoms of ADD improved but side effects are rough. Dry mouth, headache, dizziness, lack of appetite, increased anxiety. I’m on day 4 or 5 so hoping the side effects subside when my body adjusts to the higher dose... fingers crossed.	6	February 20, 2021	4
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I am currently on Adderall XR 30MG, and it has changed so many different aspects of my life, including depression.  I was prescribed Adderall because I was about to be terminated from my job. Back to the drug, I take it around 6am everyday, and found that my overall mood has changed. I am not as emotional as I was before, yet I am still able to express my feelings when necessary without the full breakdowns. I have been dealing with Major Depressive Disorder, and this medication has alleviated most of those feelings.  However, the medication has not been a miracle drug, and it contains no magic! For me, ADD has always been there. For me, it took me to be 36 years old to finally realize it was time to visit a psychiatrist, regardless of all the negative stigmas; I was glad I did, because it gave me many suspected answers, rather than self diagnosing situations.	9	February 15, 2021	17
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’ve taken adderall for years. I used to be on Lannett brand and Walgreens recently switched to TEVA. I had my script switched from CVS to Walgreens because it was closer to me. I have been on it for 3 months and the side effects are TERRIBLE.  I clench my teeth so bad my teeth have broken, I am severely depressed, I can’t find happiness in literally anything. I don’t feel motivated at all. If anything I feel less motivated to get out of bed. My skin is dry, my eyes are sinking in and I get terrible migraines. My anxiety is so bad I’m anti social, and I thought I had a stroke because of side effects. I’m 25. Just don’t take it		February 13, 2021	7
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I take two 30 mg pills a day for ADHD and it has really made a huge difference in my life. I am able to focus on one task at a time and complete it. Works great for giving me the motivation I sometimes lack. Only issue is that when I was given the white or peach ones, they did not seem to work as well as the pink ones. Talked to doctor about it and she added to my prescription to only receive the pink ones. Curious if anyone else has had this issue	9	February 10, 2021	34
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	ALVOGEN INC has got me all messed up. I've taken ADHD meds since 1st grade and I'm 32 now so I'm very confident in my ability to distinguish between generics that work & don't and why. For the past 4 years I've used the same CVS location to fill my Adderall tab 30mg generic the past two times though I received a pill that looked different thinking okay whatever this happens from time to time it is just a different manufacturer no big deal. I was wrong. I have had insanely high blood pressure increases, trouble sleeping, hardly any focus, SEVERE anxiety like where is feel like I can't breathe suddenly especially when I try to sleep, shaky hands, VERY noticeable heart palpitations, diarrhea, headaches and  weird emotional ups & downs. I've been vegan for 3 months now at first I was seeing a steady decrease in blood pressure but as soon as I started taking this new generic I'm topping out at 161/111 at the doctor a few days ago which is just absolutely bonkers and terrifying	2	February 9, 2021	9
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’ve taken TEVA adderall 20 mg IR for the past 2+ years. It worked greatly for my ADD & as an anti-depressant. HOWEVER, it has changed! Starting July 2020, the TEVA tablet was completely different. It was no longer sweet, the consistency was harder & the efficacy was compromised. I can take it & fall asleep hours later & there is ZERO anti-depressant effect. In fact, it deepens my depression.  I will submit a report to the FDA & I encourage everyone else to. Also, please research the complaints of TEVAs other generics. I’m not sure what to try next. I tried the Sandoz and it was actually worse. I received the hideous Zydus once-which gave me a migraine & intensely aching back.I believe it’s manufactured out of this country.  This experience has made me question ALL generic medications.   Please start researching yours & refuse to take these.  I tried switching to name brands but my ins. refuses to pay.	2	February 8, 2021	11
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Have used a generic for about 6 years now worked for me except it has turned me into a teeth grinder I do it all the time and now my teeth are worn to the point they are ruined.  My doctor said he never heard of that side effect but a recent visit to a dentist to try to fix my teeth I was told they see this all the time and this grinding may never go away. I need to find something that works without these side effects	6	February 4, 2021	9
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine)	My cardiologist who diagnosed me with dysautonomia prescribed me adderall in high school because my symptoms included extreme fatigue, brain fog, and *bad* orthostatic hypotension. He did not warn me about all the side effects I would experience (due partly to the fact that I do not have ADHD), and I was given a high dose to start. It did help with my fatigue and immensely improved my focus (can’t complain there, I was *hyper* focused), brain fog, and hypotension, but there were some questionable side effects I experienced for the almost 2 years I took it: complete lack of appetite, significant weight loss, resting tachycardia and angina (my dysautonomia makes my HR very high to begin with) Overall it definitely improved my quality of life for a time but it seems like a questionable Rx for people with this condition who are hyper adrenal, already experiencing an overactive sympathetic ANS, and have a high HR due to the cardio effects.	7	January 27, 2021	3
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I’ve been in this medication for almost a year . And it change my life in good way. Made me focus on my goals and I want to achieve and increased my motivation to become better person also balance my mood and decreased my depression.	9	January 19, 2021	14
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been taking Teva amphetamine/dextroamphetamine (adderall generic) for quite sometime for ADHD. In the last year, I noticed right away something was off. First was the obvious color. The Teva that has always worked for me with no problems (that was being weaned out in 2019) was as follows..  peach color and sweet, easy to swallow and not gag on. Teva now, is orange. The sweet taste that made it bearable to take has changed completely. My focus, clarity, motivation, and concentration has been/is immensely effected by the new ingredient change. (I don't have it at all)  My overall mental health, has declined quickly. It has caused my mood to completely change, headaches are constant, and upset stomach. All of this, and they don't even work. I struggle everyday now. Less main ingredient and more fillers means more pills can be produced, which means more money in the manufacturer's pocket..... Mental health should be top priority, especially being consistent with and not changing the ingredients.	1	January 17, 2021	50
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	This month is the first time I received sandoz adderall ER and it doesn't seem to work very well for me. Mallinckrodt doesn't seem to work too well for me either. I think Teva seems to work the best for me; even better than the name brand for adderall.	6	January 17, 2021	2
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I have suffered with ADHD since I was a young kid, I got diagnosed at the youngest age possible and I never got any help for it by my old doctor.  With my new doctor, he gave me Adderall XR to start out with 10 and than up it to 20 within a week if not effective.   I am on 20 MG now and it has changed my life, I failed school and life because I couldn't pay attention and now not only can I pay attention but this has also helped as my ADHD had caused Depression/Anxiety also OCD.	10	January 15, 2021	14
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Generic Adderall varies significantly depending on mfg. Reason being, the FDA says the mfg only has to “demonstrate” it “works in the same way “ as the brand-name. i.e. generic ingredients do  Not have to be same which is why so many don’t work and/or make people feel sick. My experience, the only generic that works like the brand-name is Prasco, which acquired Teva’s generic xr in 2016.  Few pharmacies use Prasco as their generic because it’s more expensive!  My Dr specifies “Prasco generic only” on my prescription for D-Amphetamine ER 30MG Salt combo. By law, the pharmacy must comply if Prasco is one of their overall suppliers. My insurance changed so I called Prasco to see if they sell to Costco. They do. Just takes a day or 2 for the pharmacist to order and fill my script. Walgreens used Prasco as their generic until recently. Now it’s Mallinckrodt which just filed for bankruptcy to settle a slew of opioid lawsuits. It’s all about $		January 8, 2021	59
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	The adderall name brand is 2-3 times better than generic adderall XR. The FDA should be inspecting these generic companies and make sure they are getting as high of quality ingredients. I urge anyone in generics to try real adderall for a month then decided for yourself. Decide to report the generics because we should be able to get a cheaper still 90$ for generic compared to $220+ for name brand.	10	January 7, 2021	18
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’m a doctor with ADHD. I’ve been on the generics to cut costs during tough times but I insist on the name brand adderall. No only is it smoother it lasts longer and helps even more than the generics. It’s a shame that cost is a bearing on necessary prescriptions and that generic are so much weaker and poorer quality. Generic adderall needs to step it up they have quality issues and their recipe is somehow flawed.	5	January 7, 2021	25
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for Narcolepsy	I was diagnosed with a severe case of narcolepsy about a year ago. I always thought it was my chronic fatigue that made me feel so sleepy all the time. I was finally referred to a sleep specialist who ordered a night and day time sleep study. When I received the results he told me I was a very sleepy person, his worst case in many years. I have been taking 20MG Adderall 3x a day. It does help but I'm still extremely tired throughout the day. The sleep doctor advised me in September that there's a newer medication that can be added to my Adderall but insurance didn't like to approve it and that in 6 months hopefully it will be easier to prescribe. I've seen somewhere that 60MG a day is the max for treating ADHD but that 90MG is the max for treating narcolepsy. I'm curious if that dose would improve my symptoms. Overall I'm happy with the medication as I never notice any side effects. I just want to feel more awake and less sleepy.	7	January 6, 2021	9
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)		Alvo Adderall sucks. It doesn’t work at all. I'm so annoyed that  my month will suck while taking this brand	1	January 4, 2021	4
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Mydayis (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I've only been taking it for 3 days but I can understand now when people say they feel it running in the background. So far no side effects other than appetite loss. I do feel energy from this but not like Adderall there's no anxiety tied to the energy its more like motivation than energy. One thing I've noticed is I like to always be doing something that is productive in some way. It's not the type of energy you get and use to dance or workout you feel driven to get things done.  It last for the whole 16 hours which surprised me I'm an ultra rapid metabolizer. I have no crash on this like I did with Adderall. I'm just waiting for my period now to see how the cramps are and giving the medicine more time to see if I do have any side effects, so far none but no appetite.	10	January 3, 2021	11
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I've been taking dextroamp-amphet ER 15mg once a day for roughly 3 months now and it's helped me greatly until 2 weeks ago and it's as if I cut my dose by 3/4! Is this normal and what dose, frequency, and type of adderall should I change to? I've heard about generic vs name brand, so what do the best ones look like?	6	December 30, 2020	1
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I've been prescribed adderall for 10yrs+ and without it mentally and physically I would be worse. I do have soreness, achy body, etc but have other health problems. Adderall has ROTTED MY TEETH OUT. Being 42 years old, fear ability to retain with out medicine as I age. I have severe withdrawal, to include extreme fatigue, severe constipation. I need the Adderral and helps some as without it life would be more difficult. All and all I would not manage without it very well but it is less effective as been taking for years. Take care and God Bless All. Be Safe!	7	December 24, 2020	10
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Narcolepsy	I take the regular Adderall 20mg in the morning, but do 10mg in the afternoon; along with my other prescribed stimulants since mornings are the hardest for me. I got a new prescription and after a couple days of feeling like complete rubbish and having unscheduled naps each day, I noticed it was different.   After having the name brand and suddenly switching to this generic; it made sense why I suddenly felt like I could never wake up, even on 480mg of stimulants each day. Even as I write this at almost 11pm, I have felt like I can't do anything but lay down and nod off throughout the day.  These generics are different and affect our quality of life. When your treatment works and suddenly you feel like you aren't even taking your medicine because of a sudden switch to a placebo-like generic is a huge problem.  Where is the consistency for these medications!?	1	November 30, 2020	25
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for Narcolepsy	Adderall worked well for a year then it wore off even with medication free holidays.

ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Fatigue	I just tried Alvogen brand of amphetamine/dextroamphetamine this month because my pharmacy. It is absolutely awful.

ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Regarding the post by DrKatz on 11/7/2020:.  I too take the 20 mg salt combo- manufactured by Teva, and have been on that specific brand for two and a half years.  I can definitely concur that something has changed with their product.   I am on a prescription of 80 mg a day and I too noticed a difference in taste, consistency of the pill itself, and it not working as well as it used to.  I am aware of a recall May 22nd by Teva for a few of their doses- the 20mg pill being one of them.   Thinking placebo, I inspected the pill closely: the depression level of the imprint is different, slight change in the oblong shape, the edging* (*like the cut/side profile of floor boards) and thickness + curvature.   The taste difference (bitter) I noticed in August. October back to normal but currently (Nov.) the taste changed again- however this time with a much greater chemical profile- like bactine or rubbing alcohol, more crumbly and not working as well for either my ADHD or narcolepsy.	8	November 15, 2020	29
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I’ve been on Adderall XR 20 mg since October 6th 2020. I have to say this medication is life changing and your psychiatrist, doctor or whatever will try and find the right dosage for you. I’m 22 years old, Male and I noticed the medication working within an hour, I’m about 220 pounds 5’8 and despite that it still kicked in relatively fast. The side affects I notice the most are as follows dry mouth, appetite suppression, some irritability, and insomnia on occasion. Adderall XR for me last anywhere from 8-12 hours, if it wears off the medical professional in most cases will add Adderall IR to take in the afternoon, since upping the dose of XR will not increase duration only the intensity of the medication itself. ADHD medication is all about finding what’s right for YOU, don’t give up if it doesn’t get manageable or fixed after the first try.	9	November 8, 2020	41
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have always used Teva Adderall IR because I have had horrible experiences with other generic, including inconsistency and lack of potency.  Understand that I have taken Teva Adderall 20MG tablets over five years, thus it would less difficult for someone like me to detect subtle changes in its effects.  I have noticed the following, and this started around September 2020.  Teva generic Adderall tablets seem (and this is very subtle) smaller in size. Second: Teva is known for its slight sweet taste. It is almost as if that is completely  gone... I’m certainly not saying that added anything to it, but I’m saying it’s an indicator  of some sort of formula change.  Finally, although the 20MG tablet is small, it used to be easy to half the tablet. Recently they just crumble. To summarize, I have also noted a very marked decrease in efficacy.	7	November 7, 2020	26
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Adderall XR is Life changing (positively). I went from being massively distractable and procrastinate constantly to getting things done. I'm not just referring to school work or office work. I mean just showing up on time to meet up with friends. Not getting instantly bored with family.  I truly love it!   --- Quick warning, take it as your doctor recommends! So much of the bad press comes from people abusing the drug.  Likewise, if you're able, take a day off now and then. Perhaps on days when you don't need to work or do much. It's sort of like coffee/tea/caffeine in that sense. Fine if you do take it everyday, but probably best if you give your mind/body a rest from it now & then.  Just like running or exercise, you need light or rest days each week to really get the most from the workout.	10	November 6, 2020	33
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	My grades instantly went from the 60s and 70s to 90s and 100s and for once I felt like I had control over my life. The side effects were pretty bad and inconsistent though, so I had to go from 20 to 15 mg.	9	November 4, 2020	18
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine)	My son had been on every ADHD meds made by mankind since he was 5. He is 17 now, and because I go read reviews after the doctor changes his meds. I thought it might help someone who has went through all of them also. Adderall was the worst . My son was happy, enteric, easy go lucky and even on daytrana.  Ritalin, foculian, etc. he never lost himself. On adderall he was drowning mentally. Depression set in, moodiness, anger, punching walls, so mad he would black out, etc. Be very careful !!!!! Do not choose this one if you but all help it!	1	October 26, 2020	9
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	The Adderal dose my doctor prescribed didn't seem to work that great(20 mg twice a day)  One day I had it after my oatmeal and it was more effective so after that I just scrunched up the pill like I did with oatmeal, but I didn't put it on anything.  I just took it like that. Works great!  Much more motivation to get tasks done so I can finish more!  Maybe you could try that if it sees not enough to work.  I use Sandoz.	10	October 11, 2020	20
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for Narcolepsy	I was switched to Adderall but after 2 years switched to Ritalin. Adderall seems to open up parts of your brain best left closed. I started to see a 12 year old boy in the yard during the day he would be gone when I went to talk with him. My neighbors told me that in the 1970s he died here. You have to watch the dosage	10	October 10, 2020	26
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for Narcolepsy	I have been soooo sleepy for the past 15 years of my life. I finally found a PA that listened to me about my sleepiness. She has been great. I can not afford the recommended sleep study. I am currently taking 10mg extended release. It has helped but I am still falling asleep at work. My PA will meet with me in after a month on it. I’m not sure if I need an increased dosage or if it’s not working on me. It’s a struggle still. I don’t want to feel hopeless that I can’t find help.	6	October 9, 2020	11
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Adderall XR was originally prescribed to me for ADD, but it worked best as a terrific antidepressant.  However, now that I've been on it for 20 straight years at 40-80 mg. Daily, it has very little antidepressant effect now. It's Adderall burnout -- apparently it strips the brain of dopamine -- the feel-good hormone.        I still have to take it just to do anything at all each day.  The worst effect is insomnia -- no matter how early I take it.  It keeps me up for 24 hours unless I finally have to take Seroquel for sleep.  Seroquel is the only thing that will knock out Adderall XR.  But I hate it because it makes me so damn sluggish in the morning, awful.        I cannot believe it's 2020, and there is still no decent antidep medication available,	8	October 1, 2020	31
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	The last 9 months generic “Zydus” was the only brand of amphetamine/dextroamphetamine available in my area. I noticed pretty nasty side effects beginning 45 minutes after consumption. I’ve never felt depression so severely before taking Zydus. Teva/Barr has returned. Felt a night and day difference the first day. Hope Zydus gets banned for the safety of us all.	1	September 23, 2020	20
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Stressed and depressed and always angry.	7	September 21, 2020	23
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Mydayis (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I switched over to Mydayis in hope of finding something that could last the entire day. My days are usually nonstop for approx 16 hours. I started at the lowest dose and went up to the 50mg after 3 weeks. Gave it a few more weeks in hopes that it would work like how we wanted it to. The negative side effects outweigh the positives. The first thing I noticed was ejaculatory anhedonia. It led to an unplanned pregnancy before I caught it. The rest included falling behind in classes and not being able to keep up at work. Felt lazy and not wanting to do anything. It was like being unmedicated all over again!	4	September 21, 2020	8
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine)	I am so confused but feeling better just knowing I am not alone. I am very sensitive to any changes in medication. I have been on 10 mg twice daily for about 10 months. The pharmacy has switched generic brands multiple times. I did well on one made by Sun Industries but am not doing well on Teva. Apparently they make the name brand which I didn’t know until tonight. I would also like to know how we can change the way generics are approved. The variations are laughable and can really cause problems. I’m hesitant to switch to a different generic because what always happens is they stop making it or the pharmacy can’t get it. I requested name brand so at least it’s consistent. Any suggestions? So frustrated! Best to you all.	7	September 21, 2020	41
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for Narcolepsy	This medicine is god send. I have been suffering with narcolepsy for about 5 years. Had no idea what I was doing wrong that I cannot keep my eye open. I am talking about sleeping for 8-9 hours and then waking up and wanting to go back to sleep. I am a public school teacher and I had no choice but to be at work all day. That was a struggle and I was embarrassed to even tell my coworkers. This summer, so many unpleasant events happened in my life, I decided to talk to my psychiatrist about unable to concentrate and the excessive sleeping pattern. He wanted me to try adderall and bam!! I haven’t taken a nap since August . I do not have any side effects, not glittery, no overworking , nothing. Just ready to start the day and get in with my life. I usually go to bed around 9:30pm and sleeps well. I take 20 mg twice a day. But if you miss a dose, back to square one. I am religiously on a schedule and take them at the same time everyday. I am in my mid 40’s.	10	September 17, 2020	38
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Generic Adderall:  TEVA vs. ALVOGEN “All generic adderall is NOT the same trust me!...... I don’t care what your physician or pharmacist may say.“  I’ve taken Adderall for nearly 25 plus years for ADD.  WHY? it works twice as good ask anyone whose taken different brands before. For the BEST quality and most potent adderall on the market is made by a company called TEVA.  Even pharmacist tell me when they run out of TEVA and must use ALVOGEN their patients complain because the pharmacies cannot keep TEVA in stock because the consumers know it’s the best and most effective for ADD and ADHD.	1	September 15, 2020	131
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have taken both Adderall and its generic(amphetamine/dextroamphetamine) for over 16 years for my Adult Attention Deficit Disorder. I have found that the original Adderall has the best effectiveness and in these last 4 tears Teva [still oval, peach/orange color] working the best for my A.D.D. Pills made by Mallinkrodt I only get by mistake, and still act like a placebo in May 2020. Dose: 20mg. X 2 daily.		August 25, 2020	24
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I do not like this formula. I have been on various generics for years and did not feel like this 10 mg did anything. Unfortunately, I've already filled this prescription and am stuck with this medication.	1	August 24, 2020	7
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been taking Adderall for most of my adult life and Walgreens always carried the generic version that worked best for me but recently they changed who they get it from now and the new amphetamine / dextroamphetamine from Lannett MFG SUCK!  They do not work at all - actually the worst next to the  YELLOW ROUND Mp 447's, PINK ROUND Cor 136's, or OCTAGON WHITE ONES.   The TEVA amphetamine/dextroamphetamine Peach Oval B 974's are the ones that work best for me and now I don' t know how to get them - Help..	10	June 16, 2020	93
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	My concern in taking generic Adderall IR for several years is the effect is has on my heart  When I take it, at the prescribed dose,  I most always have sinus tachycardia  (a heart rate above 100 beats per minute)  I also have noticed that it effects bladder emptying....and my urinary stream seems slower (and I am fairly young) and I am not usually able to completely empty my bladder.	6	June 10, 2020	26
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Since the shortage for about 3 months I've been taking generic Zydus 20mg. How do these drugs pass inspection? I think a couple pixie sticks would work better. I wonder if generic adderall from any manufacturer will ever get better. I think charging over $5.00 for this rubbish should be criminal.	1	June 7, 2020	40
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	This medication amphetamine/dextroamphetamine has made me feel VERY JITTERY and sick to my stomach! I take generic TEVA brand orange tab 30 mg. The pharmacy didn’t have any of the TEVA brand so they gave me generic U31 tablet - Aurolife Pharma, LLC brand. This is horrible! People take time off work to be seen by doctor, get put on meds for a reason, spend money for the appointment and meds, all the time you spend doing this & it can’t be returned back to Walmart to get my right medicine because “it’s against the law” supposedly! Even when I have the entire prescription (minus one) to give them back. Why make people feel like this when they do so much to try and make life easier being on their meds. I don’t have insurance so my doc visit is almost $100 & medicine is around $60 every month. My 7 year old daughters meds were switched as well. I’m scared to even give her medicine! How can Walmart just give you a different brand that you’ve never taken and not tell me before I leave it’s different!?	1	June 5, 2020	67
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Fatigue	I have been through about all anti-depressants, mood stabilizers, and anti-psychotics for my severe treatment-resistant depression and this medicineamphetamine/dextroamphetamine has saved me. Honestly, I have horrible anxiety as well. I have Chronic PTSD and Generalized Anxiety Disorder. This medicine calms my nerves as well. I can actually take naps during the day now when I need to instead of not being able to rest. It helps my impulsiveness from my Bipolar Disorder that is included in my Schizoaffective diagnosis. I may have to deal with the hallucinations but this medicine is the only medicine that works for me in the most positive way. For me, it has way less severe side effects than any medicine I have tried. It mainly helps with my energy levels which helps my depression because I feel more useful I also am more social which helps my confidence. The only thing I struggle with is the lack of appetite and it seems like water goes right through me. But, It is definitely a life saver for me. <3	10	May 3, 2020	32
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I am a male in my thirties. Adderall is the third drug I tried to tread ADHD after doing trials on Vyvanse and Concerta. Vyvanse worked but did not last long enough and I had bad crashing (headache, exhaustion). Concerta did not work for me at all, made me lethargic and even more distracted.  Adderall at 20mg a day gives me energy to focus on work and my kids. It lasts me until sometime in the evening. I have trouble sleeping some nights on it, other than that the side effects are negligible.	8	May 3, 2020	43
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Activist Dextramp-amphet ER (30 mg.) [ generic for Adderall ]  is HORRIBLE. NOT effective.

ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for Narcolepsy	Generic Adderall is not the same. I feel immediately awful when I realize they switched me to generic dextro amp (amp salts works not sure what brand. I heard Teva might have moved distribution centres and have been alternating approved cheaper alternative ingredients. Well guess what they don’t work AT ALL. Check the generic brands when you get your script filled and see how you feel. The old generic brand I took worked just fine. I cannot get out of bed for weeks because whatever “similar” generic cheap alternatives they are using do not make the cut. Welcome back debilitating fatigue!	6	April 12, 2020	129
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Adderall is very useful but recently I was ignorant and thought it would be okay to take a little extra at night to help clean my house. I took a bigger extra dose then I should have and a few hours later I felt pretty awful. I am very productive and more positive on the right dose of this med, so I recommend trying it or Desoxyn, because it is said to have fewer side effects like anxiety and panic and irritability post dose. Like all meds, Adderall is a blessing when dosed right and a curse when dosed incorrectly. I noticed that I paced around a bit when on it but I didn’t feel that anxious. It isn’t fun and enjoyable to take a big dose, don’t do it. God made everything to be used in moderation and it is much better for the whole society when we obey the wise instructions of our doctors and leaders. Be careful, obey your doctor, and may God bless you all to succeed in your treatment plans and in your lives. Amen	8	March 18, 2020	74

ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Recently changed pharmacies and didn't realize that there can be quite a difference between generics. For 4 years I’ve taken adderall 2x day, 10 mg. Never any problems until I switched pharmacies to save $.  Elite Pharma is who makes this new one and it is NOT GOOD.   I am lethargic, unable to focus, quite sleepy.  It’s as if I haven’t even taken anything.  Incredibly frustrating as I am not even half way through this months supply.	1	March 7, 2020	50
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	The generic manufacturer of amphetamine & dextroamphetamine, Sandoz, is the only one that works for me. This month the manufacturer is Northstar and last month Aurobindo, and they are garbage. They don’t help AT ALL with my focus. Zero.  I am irritable. I am getting nothing done and my anxiety is sky high. I am going to stop taking these brands and ask pharmacy for Sandoz.  I complained to the FDA and urge others to do so as well. This is ridiculous.	1	March 3, 2020	70
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Adderall has worked great for me when taken as needed. When I was in my early 20’s and taking it daily I built up a dependence that lead to terrible withdrawals as it is very addictive. (Learned the hard way and never want to go through that again!)  I will usually only take this when my ADHD symptoms are unbearable and my work/personal life starts to become affected. We are talking maybe 1-4 tablets max per month.  It really does help with focus and energy, and I find that one 10-20mg dose is usually enough and I feel good for several days after the dose without any withdrawals or dependence issues.

ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	If you're taking for ADHD please note there are a lot of side effects, having said this, they are sometimes serious so take note to talk to your doctor. If you get cold fingers or toes, make sure to consult your doctor as it's a syndrome that can be prevented.  It does help with focus, it helps with impulse control, it helps with a general overall euphoric feeling and it can cause you to lose a lot of weight. Be sure to eat, EAT, don't shake your head, you know I'm talking to you. Eat and stay hydrated it causes you to urinate a LOT, make sure to supplement what you are losing. It will cause tremors, shakes, and irritability, again, eat food. Make sure to stick to a 2000 calorie diet AT LEAST. May cause muscle fatigue and extreme soreness, stay hydrated, make sure of this.  Some say it causes better grades in school, well, to an extent. It just makes you write a lot. Eat Eat Hydrate And maybe take melatonin to help promote rest. I warned and entertained you.	7	February 21, 2020	97
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	My daughter developed tardive dyskinesia, a permanent drug-induced movement disorder, while on Adderall. If your kid has ODD, stay away from all stimulates; they are most at-risk.	1	February 19, 2020	26
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I totally agree that the new A 79 generics are no good.

I  was always down, depressed, unmotivated, impulsive, always day dreaming, short attention span, no focus and couldn't sitting still. Adderal has given me a new happy life that I can enjoy and appreciate. Starting to think I need to go up to 20mg. I can feel I'm getting used to them. But without them I wouldn't get out of bed and would waste my life.I  think adderal is my miracle drug I have never been so grateful for a prescription drug	10	February 17, 2020	111
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I was diagnosed with ADHD combined type and have tried Ritalin and Focalin. Both weren't that great for me so my doctor prescribed me 10 mg of Adderall XR. Adderall has made me have better multitasking skills and helped me pay attention. It hasn't really helped with being hyper or being impulsive and has given me bad twitching eyes. It also has made my sleep schedule weird so watch out for that.	6	February 6, 2020	23
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Picked up amphetamine with dextroamphetamine medicine 1/24/20, bottle said Barr brand? But Teva tabs were inside. Teva bought Barr in 07. Before Teva bought out multiple companies and started using their ingredients within the last 2-3 years, they were great. Sandoz and Corepharma have been the only other decent makers, before they were bought out. I haven’t noticed a thing from picking these up 1/24. The worst medicine I’ve had from Teva in 8 years.	1	February 4, 2020	36
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	On 1/24/2020 I received Teva generic IR Adderall like I usually have for the last 7 years off and on (used to be good.) Except Barr was labeled on the bottle for the first time ever. Not sure why since Teva bought Barr in 07. Regardless it isn’t any better, by far the worst I’ve had of Teva. But every other company is pathetic. Brand works 10X better but 10X pricier. If the FDA enforced the rule of not less than 80% and no more than 125% concentrated effectiveness, that would be a first! The right MG of each dose might be regulated, but the fillers/inactive ingredients added is the big issue. 1-3 used to be in the old Barr/ Shire/ Sandoz/ Core and those worked fantastic. Every generic now has 5-8 fillers that make it less effective but also cause severe side effects. FDA could care less about small market drugs.	1	February 3, 2020	50
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Game changer. First DX by A pdoc: ADHD. What, no?  Yes.  I felt like I was only working with one puzzle piece and finding out about ADHD was like being given the other 999 pieces. At first Adderall IR didn’t seem to do much but I slowly realized it was like putting emotional and mental blinders on where I could see the rest of the world but mainly focus on the task at hand. Job saver for sure.  Since I have a high tolerance to meds XR saved me from constantly trying to remember to take next dose when I started crashing. Tops.	10	February 3, 2020	30
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I have found the generic brand for Adderall is not effective as the brand name. The Epic brand caused me to have severe depression, blurred vision, headaches, very tired and no focus at all.  I’m trying to find a brand that is much like the name brand.

ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I went to pharmacy to pick up my Adderall generic brand Zydus. I was told they was out of my brand. I was given the Epic brand. The Epic brand caused me to have severe depression and I stayed in bed, I’ve always been very energetic. I stopped taking it. I called the Pharmacist and reported the side effects I had. Pharmacist didn’t act surprised at all, stated we are out of your regular brand and probably won’t get it back in.	1	January 28, 2020	18

ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	"I was so glad to see these posts.  Pharmacies are so rude to me. I switched to so many brands, but they say they are all alike, and say it doesn't matter which generic I get, because they're all the same.  My doctor, unfortunately, thinks the same.  I finally said to the pharmacy tech one day, ""I'm sure I'm not the only one, who would like certain generics."" She said, no, I'm the only one. I know this sounds crazy, but the blue 10mg of teva, don't seem to work like the 15mg of the peach teva, even if I cut one of the blue in half to make it 15mg."	8	January 23, 2020	90
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I was taking 15mg of generic Adderall  amphetamine / dextroamphetamine  for 3 months and by the end of the 3rd month I had 3 separate people tell me I didn't seem myself. I'm a regularly joyful and excited person but every emotion I had felt muted or stunted while on amphetamine/dextroamphetamine. I stopped talking it and 3 days later felt so much better. I was joyful again! Back to pinging all over the place but at least I'm happy doing it lol. I'm trying Concerta next.	4	January 21, 2020	3
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Ok so I have Both Narcolepsy/Extreme Fatigue & ADD. The generic forms of Adderall (amphetamine and dextroamphetamine) seem to be getting worse and worse. They are making them with obviously cheaper so-called similar ingredients but the new generic amphetamine and dextroamphetamine drugs just have bad side effects and don’t work for me at all or are far less effective. I don’t know if it is Teva brand that is making these cheap ineffective knock-offs that cause migraines & other side effects but they are definitely not working or decent. The generic form Amphetamine Salts works just fine for me but again I think when Teva took over and apparently used far cheaper Ingres there is definitely a disconnect because I don’t think Dextroamp-Amphetamin is a worthy generic form of Adderall but maybe just because Teva brand seems to be using incredibly cheap ingredients,	10	January 20, 2020	21

ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I’ve been on adderall for a few years now and it was life changing. I’ve always been prescribed a generic and have never had a problem until recently. I noticed that I was not getting the same benefit as I was previously and for months, tried to convince myself that it was in my head and then one month, I noticed everyday that I felt great! Looked at the pill imprint and what do you know - it was a different manufacture (Amneal) than the one I was taking. I started googling it and saw a lot of complaints for generic Adderall from Global Pharmaceutical. I’m talking to pharmacist today about it and requesting the generic by Amneal Pharmaceuticals. I thought they were all the same and it’s a shame that global can make these any less effective than what they should be. Is it so people go to their dr, say they don’t feel the effects of it and get an increase? Sounds like a big pharma thing to do. Trust your gut instinct because you’re the person who knows you best.	1	January 8, 2020	17
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for Narcolepsy	I have #IdiopathicHypersomnia & #narcolepsy. Not all generics are equal  1. #Corepharma works 2. Oval, peach #Teva does not  3. Teva started carrying same dark pink, round IR as #Corepharma  4. In 2018 Teva selling the oval, peach again 5. I filled the Rx with #Sandoz (round, peach) worked almost as well 6. Corepharma was purchased by #Epic.  7. I have been relying on Sandoz since 2018  Every month I have to call pharmacies see if Sandoz is in stock. Usually they don't have it & can't to order it. #JewelOsco is the ONLY pharmacy that places orders for me.   Today (01/05/2020), JewelOsco does not have any &  unable to place an order; the supplier is out & the date available is TBD  Has anyone tried #Northstar? How does it compare to Sandoz?  How is the pharmaceutical industry allowed to do this? If anyone reading this can point me in the direction to hold pharmaceutical companies legally accountable, please comment  *Aurobino does not work for me  #NarcolepsyDiscrimination	9	January 5, 2020	71
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	"I recently was given this new form of adderall from the pharmacy which was circular with just an ""A"" on one side... I did not like this new form of Adderall at all!! I assumed it would have the same effect as the typical oval shaped and it was completely different which is a little scary. It was very bitter and gross tasting unlike the football shaped one has a sweet note. It also disintegrated turning to powder immediately, as I attempted to break it in half (waste of product). I did not get any focus from it nor did I feel any different at all?? It did nothing! Then the next day got a horrible headache! I was talking with a friend who also mentioned getting the same thing recently. He mentioned having an extremely bad headache too the following day, so we now know it's from this form of adderall. I DO NOT LIKE IT. It should be pulled from the market honestly I don't know what the heck this rubbish  is but it is not adderall."	2	January 2, 2020	79
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Was first diagnosed with ADD(inattentive type) by multiple doctors at 18 years old. Out of the gate they prescribed me 60mg IR amphetamine with dextroamphetamine. I am now 26, taking 80mg/day, and have learned a substantial amount about this drug. No it won't make you any smarter or develop hidden talents, most believe this. The generic (dextroamphetamine-amphetamine IR) is cheaper than its brand (Adderall xr.) Obviously brand is set to higher standards of quality than generics, so yes brand name anything works better than generics, it's common sense. If you use it correctly and find the right manufacturer like Teva, you most likely won't find as many negatives as most people.	8	December 30, 2019	9
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I’ve been taking the generic version of Adderall for about 2 years now. I was tired all the time and couldn’t focus. I felt like a slug and when I had energy I still had brain fog, and had a hard time studying. In class, I would fidget in my chair, doodle, and listen to lectures, but nothing would stick in my head. No matter how long I studied.  I was prescribed the 7.5 mg tablet once a day and just the small dose did wonders for my energy levels and let me focus and actually get things done. It helped me talk in social situations and gave me a mood boost.  That being said, The generics changed a couple times. And I’m not sure, but I think I can tell a difference between them. After the pill wears off, my head aches, my legs throb, my body aches, and I’m nauseous and feel sick. I have flu like symptoms, which are miserable. It’s sad because it’s a really small dose and helps me so much but some of the side effects suck. You just gotta see what’s worth it to you.	8	December 24, 2019	61
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Fatigue	"This drug has absolutely saved my life. I have been diagnosed with severe CFS and depression approximately 14 years ago.  In 2015, I had my thyroid removed due to cancer, so I am on artificial thyroid. I could have slept for 20 hours a day and it wouldn't have been enough. I tend not to take it on weekends, as I don't need to be as ""awake"" as when I'm at work. I typically end up sleeping 12-14 hours straight on the days I don't take it. I would not be able to work full-time without Adderall. I have taken 30 mg for several years now and it has worked well for me; I have a hunch that it's because I don't generally take it on weekends, so my body gets that ""mini detox"" from it every week.   Really. This drug has saved my life. I can function again!"	10	December 5, 2019	24
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	This medication does not work at all now.	1	December 2, 2019	49
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for Narcolepsy	I was diagnosed with a sleep disorder/excessive daytime sleepiness and my physician prescribed me Adderall. After I found the dose that worked best for me (30mg in the morning and 10-20mg in the afternoon) I felt like a new person. I usually sleep anywhere from 12-18 hours a day when I don’t have classes or work (I don’t have to force myself up on these days with 2 alarms). I can still nap but they are not nearly as long as they used to be (3-8 hours). My grades have improved and most importantly, my attendance of class has improved! I used to sleep through class, but now I can go because my body isn’t begging for sleep. Overall it is an extremely helpful drug to treat narcolepsy/excessive daytime sleepiness. I finally feel like I have my life back! My only complaint is the dry mouth I experience every so often. I also still feel rather tired some days but it is not as NEAR as torturous as it used to be. Overall, it is extremely helpful and it has changed my life for the better.	10	November 20, 2019	54
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Not very effective; I took a  double dose which cause headaches and made me generally feel ill.  There are  better generics. Company should not be allowed to sell this medication.	1	November 17, 2019	13
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been on Adderal 10 mg for three months now. I have found it helps me so much in the morning. I need to talk to my doctor and see if I can get something for the afternoon. It's been a godsend but I don't have any anger issues just a lot of anxiety. I'm on Xanax as well three times a day and Ambien for sleep which really helps bed by 5 clock I'm wore out. And then my symptoms seem to return. I would recommend this to anyone that has concentration issues. I'm 41 years old and when I went to school they always called you slow. Which always made you look bad. I think my doctor he's wonderful and I'm going to get my Xanax upped and see if I can get something for the afternoon due to that I work many hours a day and I have to be on my toes.	9	November 2, 2019	6
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I got diagnosed with ADHD at the beginning of this school year, being my senior year of high school. Since 8th grade, I've struggled in school, been incredibly impulsive, had very strange eating habits, over-thought everything, and could never contain my anger or anxiety. Once prescribed, my life has changed. My grades went up, and in 3 months I've lost almost 30 pounds (I am still in the normal BMI range). I can control myself. I finally believe in myself because of Adderall.	9	October 29, 2019	79
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	Well been on and off Adderall or Ritalin since I was 5. I'm 62 now, and take 60mg XR morning and two 30mg IR in the afternoon. For me it's a Godsend. I can pay attention now,  I'm more sociable, I'm just.......me.	8	October 23, 2019	22
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I’m 48 yo woman that was diagnosed with ADHD in elementary.  When I began (on holiday) taking it I’m extremely fatigue/zombie the first 3 days, I am not nearly as engaged with anyone/anything around me (I talk 97% less when I’m on Adderall) and it makes me feel less cognitive.  I feel like it dumbs me down.  After the 3rd day I start to feel better and those “tranquilizer effects” go away. Adderall is an emotional regulator for me. It works wonders for my impulsivity, racing thoughts, fidgeting, feeling overwhelmed, anger, anxiety, zoning out, and my mouth. Yes, my mouth has always been my biggest challenge and has caused me tremendous social/professional problems.  While in a perfect world I’d be on no medication, I have to recommend Adderall for anyone whose suffering from ADHD, because  it has changed my overall quality of life for the best.  Sparkle on beautiful people! 	9	October 23, 2019	81
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I was diagnosed with both bipolar and ADHD. After trying multiple combinations, we finally tried adderall on top of Wellbutrin, Lamictal, and Fluvoxamine for OCD. At first, the adderall did wonders. Completely made me enjoy life again. However, as my tolerance increased, the adderall crash was very intense. It resulted in a bipolar low almost everyday around the same time. I recently just switched to Stratetta and is my second day taking it. Anxious to see how this works.	9	October 22, 2019	29
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Mydayis (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I’ve been taking meds for ADHD/ADD close to 8 years now.  Tried Adderall at many dosages, types and amount of times per day over a period of many years.  My biggest issue. I forgot to take them.  Tried Vyvanse. It helped but I got nauseous, dizzy every day.  Tried Adderall again and forgot to take them.  One day my doctor mentioned Mydayis. I wouldn’t have to remember taking more than one in the AM.  After a week I could tell that it was helpful but wasn’t able to tell if a BIG difference.  I ran out due to scheduling once & my brain went into hyper drive. I hadn’t felt that chaotic for awhile.  WHILE talking to my doctor she legit wrote out the prescription, handed it to me. ‘go fill it NOW.’ Even had others asking how long I would be without it.  It was clear it helped at that point.  I don’t notice any side effects.  My results with Mydayis are pretty good. No worries of forgetting it, which was the major factor in my switch.	8	October 20, 2019	11
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Mydayis (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I'm making this review one year after trying Mydayis for only a week. I switched to this drug from Adderall IR 20's BID to the 37mg capsule, you don't really think your buzzing, but you indeed are, and more so than with Adderall for the same dose. What prompted me to write this review was that I noticed someone else who reviewed this mentioned that they would be returning the bottle to the pharmacy because they didn't want insurance to think they were keeping it. This is an effect of the drug, I too, even though I bought it on the $5 coupon, did not want the pharmacy (who does not care) to think that I wanted to keep this drug so I returned the remaining 23 capsules to them. It works well, puts you in a different state of mind, and doesn't provide the sense well being of some other ADHD products offer, but it does work better than some generics. Perhaps give this a try if you're on generics that don't work. It is pretty strong, but doesn't feel like it. if that makes sense.	7	October 14, 2019	12
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I was on 10MG XR for 3 months and it worked amazingly. This is a very good medication if you have trouble functioning like a normal person, although be prepared for really dark thoughts if you decide to stop taking it. Withdrawal from this drug is no joke, it can make you want to die...but if you keep taking it or taper off slowly you should be fine.		October 12, 2019	22
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I was diagnosed with ADD in 2005 after experiencing horrible distractibility in class while at college and not being able to focus on a single thought in my head.  I was prescribed Adderall IR and I remember feeling like I had drunk 5 Red Bulls or something!  My heart was pounding and I had horrible anxiety the whole day.  I only took it one time.  I decided to get off it immediately.  Soon after, I was prescribed Strattera, which didn't do ANYTHING.  I've gone for about 13 years without actual ADD medications because I really hated the idea of stimulants.  That all changed when I realized my ADD was getting out of control.  I saw my current psychiatrist last week who re-diagnosed me and we discussed my experiences.  I had read reviews from people here who say that Dexedrine works for them if Adderall made them too wired, so I asked if I could try that.  I just tried it today and I had no horrible side effects - no anxiety, no heart palpitations, no edginess, etc.  It is wonderful!	1	October 9, 2019	21
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for Narcolepsy	I was recently diagnosed with Narcolepsy in early 2019. I was started on Adderrall, but it took about 6 months to get the regimen that worked for me. I was quite sick at the stomach for about 3 months with nausea, and headaches. I take 30 mg at 9 am, and 10 mg at 1 pm. Finally, it's working well to a certain degree.  I still need at least two naps during the day and have most of my energy in the morning and early afternoon. Come 7-8 pm, I'm literally exhausted. I realized how well the medication worked after I missed a dose. I wondered why I was yawning all day and barely able to stay awake. It was because I had forgotten to take my Adderrall. Despite how well it works, I still seem to yawn almost constantly. I would not be able to get through the day without it. It's not 100 percent fix, but I can function for most of the day using it. So, that's a plus for me.	9	October 8, 2019	17
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for Narcolepsy	I was originally prescribed for adult ADD. I took it for several weeks with some results, but I soon learned that it was great for a sleep disorder as well. Recently, I stopped taking it, but soon afterward, all I could do was sleep all day. I was extremely fatigued. I had a blood test for hypothyroidism but it was negative. The only side effect for me was hypertension which I take medication for, but lately, it has been elevated. Nothing the doctor can't fix by increasing the dosage of my blood pressure med. I don't plan to stop this mediation unless I need a larger dosage to work. Currently taking Adderall XR 20mg in the morning and regular Adderall  20mg at noon. Moreover, it helps ease my craving for carbs. It works better than any antidepressant.		October 5, 2019	22
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Mydayis (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I have suffered my entire life with ADD.  For a while Adderal helped. Then as I turned 49 it seemed to make me more anxious, irritable,  short tempered, and I had No patience for stupidity! Upon trying the Mydayis,  I was immediately impressed. I was finishing projects.  Getting things done right! Able to focus for longer durations of time. Long enough to complete tasks at hand. I feel so much better.	10	October 3, 2019	30
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I will never give this to my child again!, I know all children are different but I'm sticking with Dyanavel XR. While he was on Adderall he was acting angry and violent, like he was on some kind of illegal drug, his facial expressions were intense, and he could not sit still, and was very emotional. so I have to give this a 1 star on my personal experience and my son's	1	October 2, 2019	35
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I've had a prescription for amphetamine with dextroamphetamine for  four years, and Teva used to work fairly well for me. Over the last year or so, it's become awful. I know it isn't me, because I still have old (2-3 years) pills laying around; I tried some of them and they work just fine.   Teva changed something in the manufacturing process. The new pills do almost nothing beneficial (I feel sleepy all day), but they have a ton of side effects. I feel very jittery, my stomach hurts, and I've been experiencing bloating.	1	September 30, 2019	23
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Overall, 20 mg Adderall XR for ADHD helps me to focus. The problem with adderall is it makes me sweat something awful. Anyone else annoyed with sweating while taking adderall?	9	September 28, 2019	62
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall XR (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Well first off. Adderall is an Amphetamine  which assist with the production of dopamine. Very close  relation to meth. I am 21 years old and I started Adderall again. Previously I was on Adderall from age 8-13 and it worked great. Some say ADHD is not real and it just a symptom of bad health etc... I have been very very healthy and unhealthy which produced no changed in brain fog. Now that engineering is my main task in like I seem to have a hefty amount of brain fog. Adderall does in fact help with focus but the downside is the extreme crashes that happen when you stop taking it.	8	September 26, 2019	20
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	ADHD	I have been on Adderall for quite sometime. It has helped me focus and also being proactive. I recently got a new script and diff manufacturing teva  I noticed since I have taken it I'm extremely tired. Cannot focus at all I feel like a scatter brain..I had to call my dr to have him rewrite a new script and surrender the Teva (amphetamine with dextroamphetamine) Did anyone get the same reaction?	1	September 26, 2019	20
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I shared my experience recently on here and was going back over and reading others as well.  I believe we should all state the laboratory that producing the specific generic we are each taking. Doing so may help us all narrow down which ones to stay away from and which ones are truly therapeutic.  Eon lab  brand of amphetamine/dextroamphetamine was good until 9 months ago, now they are horrible (no therapeutic value and bad side effects).  I then I switched to Teva and they were decent for about 2 months and now they are giving me side effects.  Plus the pharmacy ran out of them and I had to wait for a new batch and when the new batch came in is when the bad side effect started.  I KNOW the drug manufacturer has changed something.  Hope that helps someone.	2	September 24, 2019	121
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Narcolepsy	I have been on generic Adderall (dextroamphetamine -amphetamine) for about a year and a half. I have always got the Teva brand with no issues. But in the last couple months I have noticed it not working as well. I just filled my script last week and they are even worse! I keep dozing off at work and back to taking naps in my car on lunch again. It's very frustrating! I take 30mg twice a day for narcolepsy. Last month during to the shortage on 30mg my script was shorted by 9 pills. This time the manufacturer was Alvogen and they were amazing! Only time I came across this manufacturer. I wish my insurance would cover the brand name. They denied me even with my doctor's appeal.	1	September 23, 2019	9
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for Narcolepsy	I have been on D-Amphetamine Salt Combo, 30mg a day for a few months for narcolepsy and actually did great. But I recently picked up another prescription and noticed this brand is called Teva generic brand. I have noticed for 2 weeks I have became irritated, forgetting easily in what I was looking for or talking about, aggressive outbursts, stomach pain, migraines, generalist not feeling good on this brand. I will be complaining over this!	1	September 15, 2019	50
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	So, I have had ADHD since I was like young. I never liked the pills they gave me when I was younger because I was already a thin kid and then taking Adderall I would eat even less. So I stopped taking the medication. When I was taking this medication I got most improved student! I went without the drug for years, until just about 2 years ago I started taking it again and It has helped me so much! I am very thankful for this drug. I suffer from fatigue , and many, many other problems. This drug is one of many I NEED, To Think Straight and to not get outta control.  It also helps me BIG TIME with my anger issues. Hope this helps someone! Star Kid Is OUT!	9	September 11, 2019	47
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	This drug is one of the greatest formulas of all time. I went from down and depressed and unmotivated to organized and focused. Also from relatively poor to rich due the effect it had on me with my enthusiasm for work	10	September 11, 2019	57
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I cannot believe that the FDA allows AUROBINDO or TEVA to sale their lousy drugs through pharmacies in the US.  Neither of these generics have any affect on me at all!!  WASTE of money!   They are playing with people's minds and well being!!!!	2	September 6, 2019	109
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	Have taken Adderall on and off for around 13 years for ADD and CFS. I was lucky enough to have tried the “real” brand Adderall by Barr laboratories. I’ve never taken over 20mg a day. This medicine has gone to TRASH.The only negative side affect from the Barr version was occasional jaw clinching.   I think Teva must’ve burned the patent formula or something because it has never worked liked the Barr, not even close.  So many negative side effects (migraine headaches, heartburn, nausea)! I keep hoping at some point they might magically start producing a decent version that actually helps instead of hurts.  The original Barr had true therapeutic value.  Eon labs produced a decent generic for a while, but BAM, it suddenly went to garbage at the end of 2018.  So switched back to Teva a couple months back and it started ok( not as good as Eon but better than everything else out there), then last months refill is feeling like they’re changing to something bad too.  Bring back real Adderall!	3	September 4, 2019	78
ACT Amphetamine XR -  5MG Tablet (Oral)	Adderall (amphetamine / dextroamphetamine) for ADHD	I had taken Adderall for many years and was slowly on the decline.  I was deeply depressed and had an absolute hopeless and helpless outlook on life with no relief. I had psychosis, delusions and impulsive behavior which I never had. I began having issues with memory, thinking, reasoning, decision making, tasks, and  concentration.  I would become very agitated if being interrupted. I was very aggressive and agitated constantly, it was at least 98% of the time in 10 years.  I read horror stories about stimulants, namely the Amphetamine line of them. I subsequently tapered off of them and feel 100% better than before. I have no depressive symptoms, delusions, memory problems, agitation or aggressiveness. I was not happy with life and my personal relationships were very toxic. I wasted almost 10 years of my life feeling like this and have other personal complications that resulted from the use of these toxic drugs.	1	August 28, 2019	29
ACT Nabilone (Oral)		I was prescribed this medication by my Psychiatrist last month for PTSD & Anxiety. It took approximately 2 weeks for the side effects (mostly drowsiness) to go away. I have been sleeping better which is amazing. However I’ve gone without it for a couple of days because the pharmacy is having trouble getting it. I am not 100% sure, but I feel terrible (upset stomach, shakiness), and I wonder if it’s withdrawal. I am going to see how I feel tomorrow. I want to continue taking it, but if it’s hard to get I am unsure if it’s worth it.	5	January 3, 2020	8
ACT Nabilone (Oral)	Fibromyalgia	Great medicine for my chronic knee pain. Recommend all the way	10	June 3, 2019	9
ACT Nabilone (Oral)	Fibromyalgia	I got my doctor to prescribe this after I tried medical Cannabis because I can't afford Cannabis. In a dosage of 0.5mg twice daily it is perfect. It helps diminish pain and treat my anxiety and gives me the ability to be less serious and laugh sometimes which is nice because my illnesses have left me feeling depressed and awful. In higher dosages I see no benefit. Use the lowest dose possible or bad side effects like dizziness and paranoia can occur at higher doses. For me it is identical to edible Cannabis in effect except it lasts longer. There is no addictive quality that I have noticed. It is helpful for sleep as well. The only complaint I have is there is always a shortage of the drug and it has been on back order for months in Canada. Luckily I have a supply from a little pharmacy that had lots left. Its worth a try and feels like edible cannabis but less psychedelic and more sedating.	9	September 3, 2018	31
ACT Nabilone (Oral)	Fibromyalgia	II have chronic pain, arthritis, osteo arthritis, sciatica nerve pain. I  have been very happy with my nabilone and use it mostly before bedtime for a good painless nights sleep.  I did have a bit of a headache a few times but not all the time or from nabilone.   Have used it for about 8 months and no side effects or complaints.  I have gluacoma and macular degeneration in my eyes, but vision is the same as before use of nabilone.	9	February 18, 2018	22
ACT Nabilone (Oral)	Fibromyalgia	I have tried and am presently using other pain medicine but have been able to reduce the dosages after taking Nabilone for only one week.	8	March 31, 2017	19
ACT Nabilone (Oral)	Nausea/Vomiting, Chemotherapy Induced	I was taking this to see whether it would help me with my migraines,  I still get migraines they are not as severe but my stomach is always upset I don't want to eat I am having too many  days I don't want to eat, not sure what to do now.	6	March 20, 2017	2
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Insulin Resistance Syndrome	I have been on Metformin 500mg twice a day . I have taken it for almost 2 years now. I am also a 5 bypass heart patient with 4 Stents. I have high Cholesterol and I am a Diabetic with Psoriatic Arthritis. I started off at 170lbs dieting, exercising every day. Since I started the Metformin , I have gained all my weight back. I am miserable and now I’m at 193lbs.I am getting depressed. I don’t know what to do now.	5	April 20, 2021	1
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Polycystic Ovary Syndrome	I started taking Metformin for PCOS, I first got a headache, then muscle cramps and aches, I didn’t think anything of it until they started getting worse and then I got shortness of breath and drowsiness. I ended up going to the ER for possible lactic acidosis, they say it wasn’t the case but I honestly don’t believe it. I quit Metformin 3 days ago and I’m still having muscle cramps, aches and then a burning and numb sensation in my thighs. I can’t believe taking this drug for only a week did all of these things.	1	April 15, 2021	1
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	Worked ok but horrible GI side effects and weight gain.  Hours after taking it in the morning I had the feeling of a bowling ball in my stomach, sometimes accompanied by cramping.  In the 3 months I took it I gained 20 Lbs which came off when discontinued. I know this is the most popular med for type 2 but the side effects are worse than the symptoms.	5	April 12, 2021	5
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	No issues with metaformin at all no side effects. On 500mg twice daily for t2 diabetes  it is lowering my blood sugar it does work.  It will only give you a boost with weight loss if your diet is clean and are exercising also. It is no miracle drug I'm losing 4lb a week but I exercise hard and eat no junk or sugar. I have 6 stone to lose but certain il get there.	9	April 11, 2021	3
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Insulin Resistance Syndrome	I’ve been on this medication for a small period of time. I’m taking 1000 mg of IR per day and so far none of those scary side effects many people have mentioned. I’ve had mild stomach cramps and nausea that lasts maybe 10 minutes of the day. Definitely a reduce in appetite however. I also am having less mood swings, thank goodness. I’m really hoping this will help with weight loss! I will update this review in a month or two.	9	March 14, 2021	22
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Female Infertility	If you take the medication with food you'll avoid an upset stomach, avoid processed sugar (metformin basically just makes you expell it) and you'll avoid the worst diarrhea of your life, I started taking metformin in January 2019 for infertility and PCOS symptoms.  It helped regulate my period. Within 2 months of taking it (coupled with a dietary change of no processed sugars I lost 40lbs in 4 months and I was pregnant by April 2019. Started taking metformin again to help with POS symptoms for ovulation in October 2020 (between then and March total weight loss 50lbs) pregnant positive March 2021 my doctor believes it's a combination of the metformin for ovulation and weight loss making it easier to get pregnant hope this helps you on your journey	10	March 7, 2021	28
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	I have been on metformin 500mg once a day for 3 mo.  At first it was great I even lost a little weight.  My A1C went up recently and I gained the weight back.  I believe that was due to extreme stress.  My doc increased my dosage to twice a day now.  I have not had many side effects just headaches no stomach issues.  I hope it helps me as I am afraid to go too high on the dosage because of the recall issues.  I am hoping the benefits outweigh the risk.	8	March 6, 2021	9
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Polycystic Ovary Syndrome	I'm 27 and me and and my husband have been trying to conceive for years with no luck , although I got pregnant about 3 years back but didn't make it past 4 weeks (miscarried). I only have one ovary due to a dermoid cyst that cause one ovary and tube to be removed when I was 16 years old. So I figured that was the issue. But went to the doc this week and turns out I have PCOS in the one ovary I have. I'm a little over weight 170lb I would like to get back to 130 but my weight has fluctuated all over the place since I got my first period, despite not hardly eating at all. So my doc put me on metformin 500mg 1x a day and recommend a low carb whole foods diet and protein shakes during the day (since I don't usually eat until 5 or 7 at night) and to workout for 30 mins a day. Then I take clomid on day 3 of my cycle. So far no side effects really a little gas but I feel a lot better I sleep a lot better at least. I still crave carbs and sweets but it's only day 4 of taking metformin.	9	March 4, 2021	3
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Insulin Resistance Syndrome	After a year-long weight loss plateau, I saw my doctor and she prescribed me metformin, saying that it's sometimes used off-label for weight loss. I don't have any conditions that would warrant metformin such as PCOS, diabetes or insulin resistance.  I've been on 500mg once daily for 1 month and while I believe it has taken effect, it hasn't helped me lose weight. I notice a significant difference in my appetite, which is helping me to remain within my daily calorie budget. And I'm thankful I did not get the severe digestive upset many people report (I got the extended release one).  However, in spite of calorie cutting, 30 minutes of exercise a day, making healthy food choices (fruits, vegetables, whole grains, less meat, more protein) and the metformin, I have lost nothing. In fact, I seem to have gained weight because all my clothes fit tighter now  I'll give it some more time, but aside from appetite reduction, it has been unsuccessful in regard to weight loss for me.	3	March 2, 2021	8
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Female Infertility	I started taking Metformin at the end of January because I was diagnosed with PCOS. My period has so far gone back to normal. The next step is to see if it fixes my ovulation problems so me and my husband can try for our first baby :) Wish me luck! So far so good other than small tolerable side effects.	8	February 18, 2021	9
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Female Infertility	I’ve been told to take two 500mg tablets daily, I’m due to start IVF in a few weeks. I’ve taken it for two days and I’m struggling, I’ve had loss of appetite and severe nausea	7	February 17, 2021	2
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	I was taken metformin for 5 months now and am losing a bit of my weight but one thing my concerned is I'm having diarrhoea all time and the worst part is if I'm going out like for walking or groceries middle of this situations I really need to go toilet straight away otherwise I will be poop on my jeans. This is really disturbing for me because some part of my daily life activities is gone. I need to stay home or if I need to go somewhere it should be near in the restroom. I don't  know if some people with diabetes type 2 is having experience same with me...thanks	1	February 17, 2021	26
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Polycystic Ovary Syndrome	I was diagnosed with PCOS when I was 16 years old I am now 26 I used to use a pill which made me have regular periods, when coming off the pill 2 years ago I only had 4 periods a year. After me and my partner decided we wanted a baby we tried for one and a half years before contacting a doctor who started me on metformin, 500mg 2x daily. Side effects lasted about a week, like stomach pain and feeling sick. I have been on it about five months now and had four periods about 38-42day cycles. Which has been great, no signs of pregnancy yet but hopefully soon.	8	February 14, 2021	6
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	I'm new to metformin 500mg twice daily, just diagnosed with type 2 diabetes, only 1 annoying side effect which is insomnia I can't get a wink sleep. Find it easy to tolerate so far anyway, I find it appetite suppressing as I don't eat as much now, which is a good thing as I'm also dieting and exercising to get my very high blood sugar levels down asap. Hopefully it is as good as people say for weight loss as I need help I'm 130kg now.	8	February 14, 2021	5
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	2 1/2 years ago my fasting glucose was 134. I didn't watch myself and it shot up to 284. My dr. told me, 'YOU HAVE DIABETES!!!' two weeks ago. She gave me metformin 500mg, 2x daily. Previous to taking this med, I was urinating 6-12x each night. I felt so awful, it was impossible to function the next day. During the day, I was urinating 2-3x/hour. My friends thought I was crazy. I was drinking nonstop because of the diabetes, probably trying to flush out all of the excess sugar.   All that has stopped. I get up 1-2 x in the night. I urinate during the day once every 3-4 hours, maybe. the metformin has really helped me, I hate pills with a passion but I must give credit where it's due. I will stay on this drug until I lose weight and bring my sugar under control.	10	February 4, 2021	3
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	Took Metformin for 2 years and lowered A1C and lost weight! Loved it! Then started getting forgetful, brain fog and very poor memory! Decided to go off metformin to see if it was the cause and it all cleared up!!!	5	February 4, 2021	5
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	My doctor just put me on Metformin extended release 500mg twice a day and I'm getting a lot of brain fog I've been on it for 6 months and I'm getting very forgetful I wanted to know does anybody else experience this it's very hard to concentrate	1	January 30, 2021	26
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Polycystic Ovary Syndrome	I have been on Metformin for 2 years and the first 6 months of taking it I lost about 30 to 40 lbs which definitely reduced my A1c but unfortunately it seems to not be working anymore. I'm 42 yrs old and am going thru many hormonal changes which could be why it has stopped being effective. Otherwise I thought it was an amazing drug.	9	January 14, 2021	5
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Female Infertility	I was prescribed the extended release metformin - can’t recommend it enough for femal infertility! After hearing so much about the bad side effects I don’t feel like I’m really having any/much on this? I hadn’t had a period for 6 months prior to starting & 2 months after I’ve had a period! I’m taking it in addition to aldactone for my PCOS. I’m considered “thin PCOS” I guess. So far with these my excess hair growth has slowed, acne has improved. Once in a while I have mild nausea or bloating but I feel full a lot faster and I don’t think I’m eating as much anymore. We’ll see if this is enough to get pregnant or if we have to add clomid!	8	January 4, 2021	8
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Female Infertility	I had hypothyroidism and ..I was extremely overweight..I lost 4 stone and took my metformin and became pregnant in April 2011 I think had a child every 2 years.

ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Polycystic Ovary Syndrome	I've been on 500mg once a day metformin for 70 days. I went a year and a half without menstruation, after stopping birth control. I've dropped 2 pants sizes, lost approx 22lbs, and today I got my first period in what feels like forever. I am so extremely happy with this medication. I only experienced the gastro symptoms for 2 days in the beginning and then my body got used to it. I accompanied the medication with trying to eat a little healthier.  However, I didn't astronomically change my diet. Cutting out sugary drinks was the big one. I just drink water now. This drug has been making big changes for me personally and I'm extremely satisfied.	10	December 12, 2020	4

ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 3c	My long time pumper here that got burnt out under the COVID craziness. Was not in a good place. Doctor checked my C-peptide and told me that I was okay to switch to orals. Been on Januvia and Metformin since April 2020 and my numbers have been nearly just as good as when using my Tandem/Dexcom combo! Some people complain about diarrhea or the pill having a fishy smell, but I have chronic constipation and lost my sense of smell after my last sinus surgery, so I haven't had any problems.	10	November 17, 2020	3
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Insulin Resistance Syndrome	Been on metformin 5 days for insulin resistance, no side effects so far. Except I am extremely happy, is this a happy pill? My SSRI never came close to this when I was on it. Seriously good mood and no anxiety.	10	November 9, 2020	29
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	Metformin was recently added to my Type 2 Diabetes Meds . I take 2000 mgs a day in divided doses with each meal. It's rough on the Stomach for sure . I'm 62. Seems to keep my sugar levels well controlled and it helps you loose weight.  Get some Zofran from your Doctor to help with the nausea . Will update my experience in a few months. God Bless .	7	October 24, 2020	22

ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	Metformin has worked great for me with zero side effects for over 5 years.   I also take 300 mg Invokana each day with about 2000 mg metformin but the Invokana does not seem to actually help that much, but at least I have no side effects from it either.  Have taken Invokana for about one year now.	10	October 12, 2020	6
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	Metformin is not for me. It tears up my stomach big time.  I have asked the doctor for a slow release but it does not work.	1	October 3, 2020	11
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	I was taking Metformin for a lot of years. The doctor slowly increased me until I was taking 3200 MG a day (800mg X 4 a day, 2 in am 2 in pm)which I was told was the Max. Next thing I knew my kidneys shut down and I ended up on Dialysis. The Hospital informed me I was taking way to much Metformin and took me off of it.  I now only Take Glipizide but my sugar is out of control, between 2 & 300 daily reading. I am here trying to find something else I can take.	2	October 2, 2020	31
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Riomet (metformin) for Diabetes, Type 2	OMG, completely and utterly dreadful. If you have a strong gag reflex you will never get it down. It tastes disgusting..nauseating, do yourself a favor and take regular Metformin (Not extended release) and chop that baby up, add applesauce, and it's a quick, pleasant swallow, just slightly bitter...can't compare to the horrid taste of this stuff. Side effects are another story...	1	October 2, 2020	12
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Female Infertility	I am 29 years old. I started metformin after having a large cyst rupture on my right ovary. I got a proper diagnosis of PCOS after that. I was on metformin for 10 months at 1000mg daily. My cycles became regulated. They still weren't the typical 28 days, but I got one every month at least. I tested positive with a pregnancy test after 10 months and am currently 10 weeks pregnant! We didn't take anything else. I only took the metformin.  I hope this helps!	10	September 28, 2020	69
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Female Infertility	Partner and I were trying for a baby for (at the time) 3 years and no luck, got diagnosed with PCOS. Doctor prescribed me Metformin and Clomid. Took it for about a year/year and a half. My periods were more regular, but then for a good month I had bad stomach cramps, diarrhea, nausea, and headaches. Luckily the side effects went away at the second month, but it (metformin and clomid) never did any good in getting pregnant. Going on 5 years with zero luck.	1	September 25, 2020	8

ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Female Infertility	I am currently on Metformin, my husband and I have been trying for 3 years to no avail. So far I am having all the pregnancy symptoms and do not want to get my hopes up as its been a roller-coaster ride for the both of us. I have nausea, heartburn, sore/tender breast (only left one), and other symptoms. I am not due for a period for another week, but my last one was longer and lighter. Hopefully I can get a positive but at this time I am thinking it is the metformin side effects. Wish me luck!		September 18, 2020	27
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Female Infertility	I took metformin 500mg sometime 2017 for 6-8months my period came out few weeks after I started it, thinking my period is stable then I stopped after a while  and my period stopped (off and on).

ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Glucophage (metformin) for Diabetes, Type 2	Before glucophage was a known to help for fertility, I took it for type 2 diabetes and got pregnant 1 & 1/2 weeks after last period.

ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	My doctor put me on Meformin after telling him I am very sensitive to all RX  Long story short I wound up hospitalized for Pancreatitis  ,be weary of these medical doctors they don't listen or care PS his next recommendation was a diabetic drug that has a propensity to cause UTI  I am managing with diet and exercise	1	August 27, 2020	28
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Polycystic Ovary Syndrome	I have PCOS and was prescribed Glucophage 500mg daily and for the first 14 days I only experienced stomach pains and slight headache. Today is the 15th day and I suddenly started vomiting about 8 times. I am not sure why the sudden change in side effects. I thought I could be pregnant but the dates don't add up.	7	August 25, 2020	10
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	I took metformin 1000mg in a combo for several years with no problems. 45 days ago a new doctor started me on a new medication plan. I started Rybelsus with Farxiga and  1000mg metformin. I had an immediate reaction of headaches, nausea & extreme hunger and my blood sugar skyrocketed. Doctor had me stop the metformin & the side effects stopped, but my blood sugar remained very high. After a few weeks she had me add metformin back in at 500mg twice a day. My side effects returned and now include constipation, but I'm trying to tough it out. I have been nauseous randomly for several days. I can't enjoy a meal or activities. Doctor keeps telling me I'll get used to it but I'm not seeing it yet. My blood sugar has gone down but not to normal ranges. I sure hope things settle down soon. So far the benefits are not outweighing the side effects.		August 22, 2020	16
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	I was put on metformin ER 500 mg once a day. My doctor told me to raise it to 1000mg (two) in the morning and two in the evening I told her about my stomach issues so decided to do 500mg in morning and 500mg in evening.  The other day I started to have very bad stomach pain woke up at 2 in the morning very bad cramping and stomach pain felt like I wanted to throw up even when I took it had a bad after taste plus made my nose bleed again.  This medicine is not good at all	1	August 22, 2020	15

ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Insulin Resistance Syndrome	Had a miscarriage and went up 5 to 7kg in a matter of days. Then would diet and exercise to extreme and come down a 1 or 2 kg after many weeks then suddenly I'd balloon again 5 to 7kg. So just kept getting bigger. Docs kept saying diet exercise. Also had very hard stomach and bloating. Swelling in hands and feet. So bad couldn't wear shoes. Got put on Metformin. Didn't really change diet or exercise and dropped 4.4kg in 12 days. Am told miscarriage caused insulin spike. I am overweight and prior to this incident had slow and steady lost over 60kg but found it a huge slog. Lots of work minimal reward. I am not diabetic. My sugars are normal. All very odd. Any thoughts?	10	July 26, 2020	21
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Insulin Resistance Syndrome	Hello I'd like to share my experience. I have a mental illness and the meds I'm on caused me to gain a little extra weight. There was no way I wanted to change my mental health meds as I didn't want to fall  back into hospital again. Anyway cut the story short I was prescribed metformin months ago. I was 98.2kg I am now 93.5kg I am happy I am losing the weight I have cut down on all the junk foods and added more fruit and salads to my diet. It also has helped me with waking up during the night and wanting to eat. I hope to lose more but time will tell.	5	June 4, 2020	61
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	I have been taking Metformin ER for 10 years. It was working fine.  Recently supplier was switched from Teva to Amneal. I found Amneal to cause high blood sugar and I discontinued. Switched to another supplier and BS is normal. I found out today Amneal is recalling Metformin ER 7 lots. I was taking a recalled lot. Recall is for higher level of carcinogenic contamination in these lots. Please  report any adverse effects	3	June 3, 2020	52
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Insulin Resistance Syndrome	I have low testosterone, high blood pressure , and over-weight {291lbs}) for the past 20 years.    I started Metformin in mid-January and worked my way up to a dose of 2000mg per day.  As of today (May 27, 2020), I have lost a total of 53 pounds and it has reduced my appetite by more than half.  My blood pressure is starting to drop to the point of needing to have my meds adjusted.  I am mountain biking again.  I am feeling great.        I have some of the side effects, but they are minimal.    All my issues seem to have a connection to insulin resistance.  I suggest doing your own research and talking to your doctor.  Based on my research online, It seems this amount of weight loss is highly unusual.	10	May 27, 2020	54
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Female Infertility	I have had a miscarriage 12 years ago then twins. Now another miscarriage and PCOS diagnosis.

ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	So far Metformin has been a wonder drug for me. I'm dropping weight, not hungry at all, and my energy levels are up.  I'm taking one with each meal.  I'm losing 5+ lbs a week and it's all from my stomach fat.  I've had one bout of diarrhea but that was in the first 3 days of use and when I took 2 in the AM versus 1 with each meal.  I do think I need to drink more water with this prescription as it seems to slow bowel movements down.  No other issues.  I'm taking a blood pressure medication and B-12 supplements with it. And a multivitamin.	10	May 5, 2020	76

ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Insulin Resistance Syndrome	OK so I am prediabetic  and on Day 4 of metformine.  So far so good. My energy level's increased. Slight reduction in appetite. I hope this keeps up, I'd like to loose weight and found it a challenge with my insulin spiking throughout the day. I'd get hungry, craving starchy foods in the later part of my days which made it difficult to keep up with my diets. With metformin, I don't think of food as much. I am more mindful of my food intakes.	9	March 13, 2020	44
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Polycystic Ovary Syndrome	I am 27 and I have PCOS and endometriosis.I was told to lose 20kg before I could be operated to remove the endo. My doctor prescribed me Metformin 500mg for the first week and thereafter increase it to 1000mg a day. It's my 9th day of being on Metformin and I have lost 2.25kg in this time. My goal is to get to 55kg and I'm currently 71kg. I haven't really experienced the awful diarrhoea however I have been getting crazy heart palpitations. Also,when I increased the dosage I found that within the day I would experience some bad stomach cramps but that's about it. Hoping to achieve my weight loss.	8	March 1, 2020	32
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	Very disappointed with this metformin product. When I removed the safety seal there was an obvious defect- about a third of the tablets were stuck together and deformed. I don't know if they sealed moisture in the container or not but I don't trust the deformed ones to be safe.	1	February 28, 2020	11
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Insulin Resistance Syndrome	Found out I was insulin resistant after a 2 hour glucose test. My Dr prescribed Glucophage which I was very apprehensive of taking. I happen to suffer from severe anxiety and bouts of depression. After taking this drug, my life changed. No depression, no anxiety and no brain fog. I didn't experience any negative side effects. This has literally changed my life. No psychiatrist has ever been able to cure my anxiety. Happy to say I am cured.

I feel like it was working at first since I did get my period 6 days after taking my first pill. My doctor had me take 1 pill for the first week and then 2 pills the second week and so on. I missed my period and I am not pregnant ? Has this happened to anyone else? Did metformin only give you a period the first month?	6	February 5, 2020	44
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)		Hi all just want to share my experience.... I'm taking apo-metformin 500mg, I'm taking it due to being a little over weight. I take two tables twice a day one in the morning with food and one at night with food. I was origanally taking just one at night but my doctor changed it. My weight was 98.20kg and now I'm 95.4kg. But I've been taking the one tablets at night for couple months only 2 moths ago did I change yo two tables twice a day. It  has stop my munchies as I'm on other meds that make me have a crazy appetite I have notice I'm not craving all sorts of foods and I rarely get up during the night to eat as before I was getting up nearly every night. I guess this medication is working as  I haven't gone up in weight and I'm slowly seeing changes in my weight.	7	February 5, 2020	18
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Polycystic Ovary Syndrome	I have been prescribed Metformin XR 1000mg per day and increasing to 1500mg next week. It has reduced my appetite but every time I eat I get stomach cramps and need to run to the toilet. I have a sensitive bowel anyway so my body takes a while to adjust to medication, therefore I am prepared to endure the tummy upsets for a couple more weeks. I am normally always hungry and need to eat a fair amount of food, however when on Metformin I am rarely hungry and it doesn't take much to fill me up. With the combination of reduced appetite and frequent visits to the toilet, it's no wonder people lose weight. Short term pain for long term gain yeah?	8	February 3, 2020	17
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	I tried regular Metformin and the extended release and my stomach just cannot handle it.  I had severe stomach cramping and uncontrollable diarrhea...meaning when it hit, there was no warning and no time to get to the bathroom.  I tried with meals, with milk, without meals and nothing could allow me to tolerate it.	5	January 31, 2020	64
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	I'm this for T2 diabetes and PCOS. Yay me? -__-  I've been on Metformin since I was about 10 years old. I'm 27 now, it always worked well for me. But I had been off it for a long time due to insurance and income issues. It never caused this explosive diarrhea back in the early 2000s! Thankfully that side effect has subsided.   I learned from some Cysters' (pcos sisters) to take Metformin late at night, in the middle of a full meal and drink a full glass of water. Imodium also helps, but I hardly even have to take that now.   So it lowers my A1C, aided in weight loss, gave me my cycle back and helped with the facial hair some. I take the 1000mg once a day.   Fellow Cysters taking this for PCOS, I recommend you join a PCOS support group. It's blessed me greatly. :)	10	January 24, 2020	24
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Polycystic Ovary Syndrome	Guys don’t give up. I took Metformin 4 and half years ago for my PCSO as I was trying to conceive.  I did one round of clomid and fell pregnant but had an ectopic pregnancy and had my right side tube removed. Then a year later we went for IVF round and that was unsuccessful.  I gave my self some time to recover from the heart ache. My doctor recommended me to take Metformin to regulate my period.  I started  with 3 tables a day 1500mg, I experienced nausea for first 2/3 week I did lose few pounds but was never overweight (BMI 24). I started taking tablets in January and period starts to regulate after two months.  Me and husband had appointment for second round of IVF in June 15 and I decide to do a pregnancy test in June 2015  as I was feeling very tried and to my surprise it came out positive.  I took Metformin for 5 months to give me a miracle baby after one test tube baby.  My baby was born on time and healthy. He is turning 4 years old next month.	10	January 21, 2020	115
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Polycystic Ovary Syndrome	Like most of you, diagnosed with PCOS. Gained lots of weight that can't seem to be able to  shed. Bad acne on around my chin and jawline. Also a few thick facial hair. I am also 28 and want to start a family. Been on birth control pills and honestly was going no where with it. Crazy heavy periods that last to a year or so. Been off BC and no period guess its better the long heavy ones. Seeing everyone reviews gives me hope to loose unwanted facial hair, acne & weight and also go get my cycle ready to conceive. 2nd day on metformin so crazy side effects yet just loose stool.	9	January 11, 2020	18
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	I still have high blood sugar.  Now I get to wake up at 3am and spend an hour dealing with diarrhea. I have been late to work, and missed important meetings dealing with these side effects. I honestly rather back to un treated diabetes than to continue on with meformin.	1	December 28, 2019	37
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Polycystic Ovary Syndrome	I started metformin when I had tried to conceive with no luck. I had had extremely irregular periods (9 months with no period, bleeding for months when I did get it) and within 3 months  on metformin my cycle was perfect and I conceived on month 4. I stayed on it through my pregnancy and only gained 6lbs (I am very overweight). I had stomach side effects but I am so glad I stuck through them.. they went away completely	10	December 26, 2019	56
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Polycystic Ovary Syndrome	Metformin made me sick.  Metformin made it possible for me to conceive, twice.  Both of my kids were born very healthy.  The gross feeling for a few months was worth my family. :)	10	December 25, 2019	57
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 3c	I have surgically induced Type 3c DM, and Metformin made me go hypoglycemic for hours. Yes, it helps with insulin sensitivity, but since glucagon production is also compromised (not equally I may add), it isn't always possible to autocorrect for the lows.		December 23, 2019	3
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Glumetza (metformin) for Diabetes, Type 2	For the past 22 years I have been taking a different metformin brand.  For the past 3 months I switched to glumetza noticing a significant difference. Not only did it help lower my level of glucose, but also contributed to reduce my hypertension to almost normal range	10	December 20, 2019	39
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Female Infertility	"I'm 34-years old and my DH and I have been TTC on and off for 10 years. I was diagnosed with ""unexplained"" infertility.  I switched doctors, she diagnosed me with PCOS and prescribed me metformin.    I took for a month (my dose of metformin was one 500 milligram tablet  daily for 2 weeks/ then 2 a day) & took a pregnancy test.  For the first time in my life, I recieved a positive!!    At my first appointment, it was determined that I had an ectopic pregnancy.  It was devastating.  I had to wait 3 months after that to start trying again; however, I'm convinced the metformin worked!  Good luck to you all!!  I'll update when/if we get our miracle.  Keep the faith ladies! Lots of prayers to those struggling to conceive. May God bless u all."	10	December 15, 2019	90
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Polycystic Ovary Syndrome	I’ve been working out and eating right for a long time and weight would not fall off, when I got on Metformin I was not only able to lose the weight but maintain it too! It’s done wonders for my insulin resistance and I’ve had little to no issues with it. I experienced some nausea and hair loss when I initially started it, but I started taking a B-12 a day and the hair loss went away. The nausea went away over time.	9	December 12, 2019	32
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Female Infertility	I have PCOS and had a successful pregnancy with clomid 2 years ago at 150mg after taking clomid for 5 months.  I started clomid again 150mg for 9 months with no success this time. I did ovulate every month though. My obgyn referred me to a fertility specialist and after doing more lab work decided to put me on a dose of metformin 850mg 2 tabs per day of metformin. I took 1 tab for 1 week and  the 2 tabs on the second week.  The first week I had diarrhea , nausea , headache but was tolerable . I also got my period 6 days after starting metformin after not having one for almost 6 months .. so that’s a plus. On the second week of metformin dosage of 1700mg my side effects got worse I still have diarrhea, light headed , stomach pain and also vomiting . I take it at dinner time. Once I get home since I work in the day time.  Hope this works with all these side effects lol . When I was on  clomid I did not have any side effects. I’ll update You ladies and see if I ovulate :)	10	December 12, 2019	11
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	"I've lost ten lbs in a little over a month taking metformin for type II diabetes combined with giving up sugary sodas and watching carbs, however passing gas has become a gamble too risky to take if you get my drift. The intestinal ""discomforts"" are real, folks. They're not kidding about that."	6	December 8, 2019	44
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Polycystic Ovary Syndrome	I love metformin. I've been on only two weeks and I literally have had no symptoms. Eat with it, don't ignore that. Also, up your water intake. You will get sick if you don't eat enough. I was scared for NO reason. My best friend refused to take it and developed diabetes by age 30( diagnosed at 19). I was just diagnosed with PCOS 2 weeks ago at age 30. She begged me to listen to my doctor and take the medicine. I'm excited to change my lifestyle and with this medicine lose some weight.	10	December 4, 2019	22
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Polycystic Ovary Syndrome	Started taking Metformin 2 weeks ago 1500mg daily to treat PCOS. Periods have improved significantly. Leg and back pain has completely disappeared and I have lost 10kg since starting Metformin, I didn't even manage to lose 1kg in 3 months while on a low calorie diet so that's great. My mood is much better and my facial hair and acne seems to have also disappeared. Feel like a completely different person on this medication.	10	November 30, 2019	49
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Female Infertility	My endocrinologist recommended metformin for a few reason, to reduce hair and acne on my back and chest to help with fertility. Speaking of fertility, me and SO had been trying for 2 years. We took the step to go through IVF.  We went to see the specialist did all the tests and was going back to see him when my period was 2 days late, however my cycle is on time every month so it seemed a bit odd. Took a pregnancy test came back positive, it was pure shock as the following week had my appointment with IVF. We were ecstatic, which was short lived as I had a miscarriage.  It has now been 4 weeks and I'm late again for my period but I've taken 3 pregnancy tests and all came back negative. So I'm confused as to whats going on.  I started metformin yesterday and the specialist said it will not affect my pregnancy  (if I am pregnant) or conceiving. Any chance my cycle has changed due to me miscarrying or could they be false readings? Just would like to hear everyone else experiences if similar to mine.	1	November 23, 2019	10
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Polycystic Ovary Syndrome	I have PCOS and was put on metformin last Friday so one week now. I have noticed my mouth feels funny and I not so angry. Not looking to get pregnant have two kids 13 yrs apart. Have had PCOS for 18 yrs. Is the numbness in mouth a side effect?	6	November 22, 2019	8
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	Has anyone had a problem when they switch brands of metformin?	10	November 21, 2019	19
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	My husband was diagnosed with type 2 diabetes over 10 years ago. Started with  metformin but the numbers were jumping high so the doctor added another one but numbers were still out of range, so another pill, then another was added and talk of insulin the next option. A blood pressure pill was added to protect the kidneys. The past summer my husband joined me on the keto lifestyle as well as intermittent fasting. He  went off all med ( the doctor knew). His glucose readings were great. But the doctor told him that he wanted him to get back on metformin because the latest research showed that it can extend one's life and is good for the heart. My husband did not want to do this but I pushed and he started back on it. Well almost immediately his blood sugar spiked into the low 200's then mid 200's. He went off it and within 48 hours his numbers were down. He is in the 80's to low 100's doing keto & fasting.	1	November 21, 2019	65
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	When I was first diagnosed, my doctor gave me Metformin. After I took the very first pill, I had SEVERE stomach pain, nausea, and vomiting. I spent hours curled up in the fetal position balling my eyes out. I didn't care if it took time to adjust to the side effects. I tried one day's worth of the medicine and tossed the rest. My doctor went on to prescribe Amaryl.  I'm sure Metformin is a great drug for some people, as it works well for other family members, but the stomach pain and vomiting was too much to handle. No thanks.	1	November 17, 2019	27
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	I was prescribed Metformin for prediabetes 4 months ago. Month 1 I experienced awful gastro intestinal issues, to the point of opting to eat only at night, when I was home because 20 minutes after eating, required me to be in the bathroom for an hour. Months 2-4 I took Metformin extended release, (which was not covered by our drug plan), no changes whatsoever other than worsening bloating/stomach pain and liquid diarrhea, then my hair began falling out by the handful. Even my husband was noticing my hair all over the bathroom floor when I brushed. This is an awful medication and all the alternatives seem to have terrible side effects too.	1	November 14, 2019	24
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	I took metformin for two weeks - changing from IR tabs 500 mg twice a day, because my A1C was down to 5.5 - mostly due to gall bladder trouble and not being able to eat. This medication caused SO MUCH INTESTINAL DISTRESS I was forced to switch back to IR tabs. Stomach pain, severe bloating and gas, and diarrhea. This may not be the case for others. I also must take ox bile and other digestive supplements because I no longer have a gall bladder.	1	November 13, 2019	13
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	Been on different brands of metformin for over 10 years.  This one feels like you have just ingested acid.	1	November 7, 2019	10
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	Metformin causes my husband to have yeast infections. Yes, even though he's a man it causes yeast infections		November 6, 2019	15
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	I have been taking metformin 500 twice a day for 4 years with no side effect and with consistent blood sugar level. Eating whole foods, exercise, drinking plenty of water, and drinking light tea will help me avoid some of the side effects.	9	November 3, 2019	26
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Polycystic Ovary Syndrome	I was prescribed metformin twice. The first time was for pre-diabetes and also to help lose weight. I didn't follow through with it because of the smell of your urine the medicine makes you have (maybe it's just me). Anyway, the second time, I was older and diagnosed with PCOS because I had been TTC (trying to conceive) for years. My doctor advised me to lose weight to better my chances. It was a rough start with the loose stools and nausea, but once your body gets use to it, you will see! In 2 months I lost 20 pounds. I thought my scale was broken, but I noticed that clothes I was about to give to good will started to fit! Anyway, whatever your reason, hang in there. It definitely works wonders for your health. I'll let you decide.	9	November 2, 2019	46
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Insulin Resistance Syndrome	I've had type 1 diabetes for 35 years, since age 5, but developed insulin resistance after being on steroids and subsequently gaining weight. My endocrinologist decided we could try metformin off-label to see if it would reduce my insulin requirements and help me lose weight after I lost nothing on a 1200 calorie low carb diet in four months of strict compliance. I was having blood sugar spikes during the night from 100 to nearly 400, likely due to my liver releasing glucose. That disappeared after my first dose and I woke up at 102. I'm reducing insulin daily so I should lose some weight finally. I'm only taking half a dose right now but will increase it soon. Stomachache is pretty much constant since I started this medication.	5	October 26, 2019	19
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Polycystic Ovary Syndrome	I’m 34 and I go months without a cycle. I had a cyst on one of my ovaries. After I had what I thought was a normal cycle. I started using the diva cup during this cycle. It was fading when on the last day, my diva cup almost got stuck but I was able to get out. Since August 1st, I had a cycle until October 9th. It started again on the last 11th...mainly spotting when I wipe. My PCM said my cyst popped & that’s why I was bleeding. As of yesterday, it seems like I’m having a cycle in between the constant spotting. My PCM prescribed me metformin to regulate my hormones, so I hope this helps. I’m going to begin taking it tonight. I am SO tired of bleeding. If you ladies have any recommendations as far as to stop bleeding, please share so I can let my PCM know. A friend of mine said she had a uterine artery embolization(UAE) procedure done to stop/regulate her cycle. I’m going to ask my PCM about this tomorrow.		October 24, 2019	3
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Polycystic Ovary Syndrome	I was diagnosed with PCOS when I was 16. I was over weight, no period, cysts in my armpits, my body went into pregnancy mode and I craved foods and started lactating and my thyroid was damaged. I was put on metformin 500mg 3 times a day  and thyroid meds. I’ve been on them for 10 years. A few years ago a doctor upped it to 1000mg 2 times a day . Haven’t seen a huge difference .  Immediately when I was 16 and started taking it I lost weight and got my period . All the symptoms went away over time as well. It’s known to cause sickness and stomach problems for a while and anytime you are irregular with taking your medicine. I experienced that for a few weeks but didn’t come off of it because it’s suppose to go away, and it did . I take mine when I wake up and when I go to bed . I haven’t had any problems with my periods for 10 years , until recently. I’m 26 and my periods have stopped the last 2 months so my medicine will be adjusted this week most likely by my doctor	9	October 23, 2019	10
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Polycystic Ovary Syndrome	I am currently taking Metformin. I was prescribed it in June for PCOS. I am 23 years old. I can honestly say, I didn't get consistent with taking until September to now. I am currently on day 29 of bleeding (menstrual). I am kind of a mess emotionally and just want to stop bleeding. I take 1000mg a day metformin. Considering upping to 2000mg as the doctor recommended in the first place, it just took time to get my body to stop having the side effects. IDK at this point how I feel about Metformin. My acne has gotten wayyy better. That's one benefit. I just really need to lose weight. I also just want to stop bleeding. I'm just over it. It's starting to depress me. Thanks for letting me vent. I need friends who are going through PCOS. I could really use some support.

ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	I was prescribed metformin 500mg twice a day. After a week I looked nine months pregnant from bloating. Also experienced flu like symptoms: lower intestinal cramping, low backache, stomach pain, fatigue,  generally feeling bad, low energy. I  quit and went on to try other drugs but could only tolerate Januvia, with moderate success; now insurance won't  cover it and I'm on Basaglar insulin  with the only side effect of  weight retention/almost impossible  to  lose.   I'm so annoyed  that doctors, nurse practicioners and pharmacists pump up all these drugs and how great they are without  telling you  about  side effects, then show no empathy to your when you tell them you're having them. One provider even asked if I  was imagining side  effects!	1	October 18, 2019	29

ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Polycystic Ovary Syndrome	Tried metformin a few years back (a pink packet) for polycystic ovaries and my periods returned. Though I stupidly stopped taking the medication. Then tried to concieve ..nothing. No periods for a further 4 years. Then I was prescribed metformin (brown packet) for 6 months. No period. Then, this month I was given a pink packet. 4 weeks in and today I started my period! I have lost a stone being on metformin overall happy. Hopefully I will conceive now.	7	October 13, 2019	9

ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	I've been taking metformin for diabetes for several years. I had a really hard time being compliant with it, especially when I had to take it twice a day. Thankfully at some point my doctor told me about extended release, so I only have to take it once a day. (4 large 500mg pills)  I don't notice any kind of side effects with it. It is mildly okay at lowering my blood sugar, but it can't get it to the normal range by itself. I also take insulin and Victoza, and the three together are sufficient. Without the Victoza it's also mostly successful, but just insulin or just metformin aren't enough.  I also have PCOS, although it's very mild. I'm not sure if it's mild because of the metformin or because I just don't experience many symptoms.	8	October 10, 2019	6
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Polycystic Ovary Syndrome	Hey ladies, I was so relieved when I found this site with all of you woman speaking out on your experience. Today was my second time a doctor prescribed me Metformin for my PCOS .  I'm 22 years old and was diagnosed around age 19 , at 19 my periods just STOPPED after being regular since like age 12 . Currently I haven't had a cycle since  April 1st, today is October 7th. The acne and weight gain is stressing me out !!! BUT I'm so scared to take this medication I never picked it up from the pharmacy . My mom makes me even more scared about it . I wish we could all chat about this BATTLE .Well today I think I will pick it up and give it a try after reading all of these reviews !! Wish me luck , better yet keep me in your prayers that this may help turn my condition around, before I get older and have to stress about even just having a baby .	1	October 7, 2019	16
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Polycystic Ovary Syndrome	Hello everyone  I was just after a little bit of advice really regarding Metformin and PCOS. I was diagnosed with PCOS a couple of weeks ago after trying to figure out what was going on for so long. I have very very irregular periods in the last year. I also notice that I tend to spot a lot, almost every time I wipe there is blood on the tissue, is this normal with PCOS? I started taking 500mg Metformin and have experienced a few side effects but nothing too severe. I was wondering whether you can ovulate without a period on these as I've been taking them a week and no period but I am hoping to conceive? Any info would be greatly appreciated. Good luck to you all :)		October 7, 2019	25
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	The Metformin ER bearing 184 in one batch I'm taking stinks like rotten fish! Everything I've read says that the immediate release is the one that smells. So did something get messed up?	3	October 7, 2019	3
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Insulin Resistance Syndrome	Been taking the max dose of Metformin for almost two years now despite being non-diabetic and a young female within a “normal” BMI range. Diagnosed with “prediabetes” by my endo and has never officially crossed threshold for diabetes since being on Metformin. There’s definitely an adjustment curve when beginning this medication; it’s been a while but I remember the first few weeks were full of INTENSE cramping, nausea, gas, loose stools, and strangely enough, back pain. The loose stools don’t really go away but all the other symptoms have pretty much subsided. Despite its unattractive side effects it has really helped me stabilize my weight (I was randomly gaining exponentially) and even curbed cravings. Thinking about talking with my doc to lower the dosage though because I’ve noticed that it’s starting to make me intolerant to alcohol and certain other medications.	7	October 6, 2019	25
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Polycystic Ovary Syndrome	"I went to my OBGYN and got diagnosed with PCOS. She didn't do blood work but she did do a vaginal ultrasound and we got to see all my little cysts on both ovaries. I had so many on both of them that we couldn't count all of them. Since my husband and I have been trying to conceive for 9 years, my Doctor put me on a ""combo"" medication, as she calls it. She put me on Metformin 850mg a day and on Radiance20, which is Drospirenone-Ethinyl Estradio, for 1 tablet a day. I'm suppose to take it for 3 months then do Clomid for 3 months, if nothing happens then I have to repeat everything again for the same amount of time. I started my treatment 2 weeks ago and I still haven't gotten my period and I'm getting concerned. As for my symptoms, I've had mild diarrhea, less hungry, lower abdominal cramping, breast tenderness and lost 3 pounds. I'll update when I can! Thank you everyone."		September 25, 2019	18
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Polycystic Ovary Syndrome	9 years marriage, PCOS since 14, Period comes 2/3 times in a year, acne, weight 143lbs, height 5'.2'', TTC  (trying to conceive) for 2 years, tube open, After failing 3 cycles of Clomid, now I am taking metformin XR 500mg/twice a day with letrozole 5mg. At first, I didn't understand the process of taking the med, doctors said to take with a meal, quite confusing. So I took it usually after finishing my meal, also folate. Then I noticed stomach ache and uncomfortable. So I changed the shift, took it in the middle of my food. Then the pain is gone, and now it suits me well.  After 10 days I got my period 15/8 seems happy that not actually happen without Provera. Today 19/9, still didn't get my period. Feeling tensed and can't share these to anyone, cause don't want to upset my family with false hope. I haven't tested yet, want to wait for a few days, actually afraid of going through the heartbreaking single line. Does metformin regulates period every month like clockwise or is it messed up by delaying?	10	September 18, 2019	15
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Insulin Resistance Syndrome	Feeling energized, my skin, hair and nails look flawless, my mood has improved tremendously, I feel prettier and somehow sexier. I'm even turning some heads at the stop lights lol Not carving for sweets and not feeling hungry at night. Eating half of my usual portions because I feel plenty after a few bites. No headaches or dizziness just a little stomach looseness. I'm always thirsty which is good because I'm drinking 1.5 lit of  water when I was used to 500 ml only.My belly looks definitely less bloated.  I love you metformin <3	8	September 12, 2019	82

ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Polycystic Ovary Syndrome	Update (Idid a review on 2019-06-13): I have been on Metformin for about 3 months. I went from non existent periods and I have had two since being on Metformin. They are very light, but hey it's a sign that it must be doing something. My acne has calmed down and I'm down 4 lbs. Take this medication consistently or it will not work as well, obviously. Eating healthier along with exercise helps a lot. I've had no side affects.	7	September 3, 2019	12
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	This brand does not stink like some of the others (you know that sewage smell).  It won't make you want to vomit like some of them. Highly recommend.	10	August 23, 2019	16
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Polycystic Ovary Syndrome	Starting metformin again for polycystic ovary syndrome after being off for 15 years. It is time. Wanted to share that if you have bad side effects, ask for the time release version. Makes a big difference. Also, eating non-processed, whole foods will lessen them. I was successful with infertility twice, 9 years apart using metformin, clomid and progesterone. Prayers for those trying! ❤	10	August 8, 2019	12
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Polycystic Ovary Syndrome	I've taken metformin to treat my PCOS for nearly 2 years now (I can't take any kind of birth control, they make my blood pressure dangerously high). At first it was a challenge because of the side effects (nausea, cramping and diarrhea) but I figured out that taking one pill with breakfast and the other right before bed seriously reduced the side effects.  However, even if the side effects had continued I would still recommend taking it for PCOS. Feeling a little gross for an hr or two every day is MUCH better then ending up in the hospital again from a massive cyst rupture.	9	August 1, 2019	8
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Insulin Resistance Syndrome	I take this to control my glucose tolerance. I take 500mg three times a day. It has been effective in controlling my blood sugar and I feel better now. Glucose used to make my arthritis worse but that has changed for the better now.  As for the side effects, I used to feel shivers and lightheaded at times but the intensity of the side effects has reduced over the one month I have been using it. I don't know how long I will be taking this drug but I will keep updating you on my future progress.	7	August 1, 2019	26
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Polycystic Ovary Syndrome	"Metformin definitely works. Me and my husband been trying for almost a year before seeking for doctor help. Find out that I have PCOS. My OB doctor immediately put me on metformin 500mg for the first two weeks and increased it to 1000mg on the third week. I started on 6/28 and by 7/28 (the date that I will never forget in my entire life), I got a positive pregnancy test. That mean I got pregnant after 2 weeks by using Metformin along with eating healthy and working out 40 minutes per day. Ladies, don't ever give up and always keep your hope up. And most important thing is prayers. ""Just ask, and you will received. Just knock, and the door will be opened."""		July 30, 2019	119
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Polycystic Ovary Syndrome	(Update)  I started using this drugs for PCOS about a week ago. It made me feel dizzy and weak at first and also gave me diarrhea. I realized that I only get diarrhea from it when I don't have a good meal before taking it. Also I don't feel weak or dizzy from it anymore and I got my period 5 days after I started to use it. I think it works good if you take it like you are supposed to. I'm currently not experiencing any side effects.		July 30, 2019	12
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	Only side effect I have from metformin is a dry mouth.  Other than that, no side effects.  Lost 25LBS since I started.	7	July 29, 2019	33
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Polycystic Ovary Syndrome	I was extremely scared to start this metformin medication after reading all of the horrible experiences people had. My doctor prescribed me 500 mg a day to start with, but for a week I cut it in half to try to lesson the side effects. Seems to have worked, because I am now up to the dose she prescribed with absolutely no side effects. I had a ton of anxiety for no reason. I eat a normal meal and then take the pill. For me I take it after dinner since I tend to skip breakfast. If you were prescribed this for PCOS, don’t be scared. Just try it. Cut your does in half if you’re like me and worry about everything. I haven’t been on it long enough to know how much it’s going to help me. I will update after I give it enough time.	10	July 22, 2019	29
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Polycystic Ovary Syndrome	I am all for Metformin for PCOS! Even with the side effects. I had awful acne, was quite overweight and was trying to get pregnant for almost 2 years. I started Metformin and 1) acne disappeared 2) got pregnant 2 months after starting 3) lost quite a bit of weight.	10	July 14, 2019	60
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Insulin Resistance Syndrome	Started taking Metformin ER 2 years ago for Insulin Resistance but found out later I also had PCOS. First time taking Metformin I had severe diarrhea that was uncontrollable. Now I always take with dinner and this seems to have resolved that issue. To be honest, not sure if I physically feel any different. My numbers look better from blood tests but I don't feel a difference when taking it.	5	July 10, 2019	16
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	I was diagnosed with as pre-diabetic I'm on metformin 1000mg twice a day, but the diarrhea is so bad I take the full 2000mg at once at night with food and I am up at least four times in the AM going to the bathroom. So I can't take it early because it keeps me going to the bathroom and I wouldn't be able to work. It's been about a month I get my blood levels checked again in two more months. I hope I am able to keep taking it that long. I wonder if the diarrhea is why people lose weight on this, because during the day while at work I am afraid to eat.	7	July 4, 2019	24
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Female Infertility	Tried the metformin three times to help me get pregnant. I apparently get a very odd side effect  where I become like a zombie. I can't work, can't think, can't do anything. Just very fuzzy-headed. Someone would tell me something and I'd forget it before the whole sentence was out of their mouth. It did give me diarrhea but the inability to function made this impossible for me to take more than three days.	2	June 27, 2019	10
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Polycystic Ovary Syndrome	Only been on Metformin for a month for PCOS. I've tried to take it a few times in the past but felt too sick to continue. But this time they prescribed extended release tabs which have been much better. My cycle has already seemed to be getting back in track. My appetite has lessened as well, which is a nice side benefit. Been trying to get pregnant for 4 1/2 years. I don't expect a lot but you never know!	9	June 25, 2019	9
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Polycystic Ovary Syndrome	"Hi, I've had PCOS since I was 17. Now I'm 32 and I've been on metformin for 3 months. I get really bad stomach aches and cramps to the point that i feel like I'm going to be ill. I also get heart burn almost every day and bad diarrhea several times a day. The side effects never seem to improve. I'm on about 1000mg to 1500mg a day. I don""t get my periods at all. Been prescribed clomid to ovulate but haven't started yet as I'm a bit nervous."	7	June 20, 2019	7
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Diabetes, Type 2	Been taking Metformin 750 extended once a day ! Diet exercise  for 6 months by now  My a1c was 13 now is 6 ! With supervision of my Dr and keeping strict life time changes this drop was possible !  Side effects sometimes  creates Gas  ! I feel tired  but I try my best to stick to my exercise program some  back discomfort! Mentally I want to eventually not take the medication anymore but I am not a dr I need to wait for her directions ! People need to check their blood sugars levels daily so they know if treatments are working ! Most important research what you put in your mouth when it comes to your diet it makes all the difference !!!!	8	June 17, 2019	29
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Polycystic Ovary Syndrome	I was diagnosed with PCOS when I was 20 years old. I am now 23. My periods have been non existent ever since I hit puberty. The only time I have a period is if I am on birth control. I really got sick of being on birth control and my hormones being so on and off. I got prescribed Metformin about 8 months ago. I never took it when first prescribed because I was so afraid of all of side effects everyone has experienced. Well, I finally decided to take Metformin because I really want a regular cycle. I am not trying to conceive. I just want my body to be normal. And let me say I have no got no side effects what so ever. Everyone reacts differently to medication, so don't let it discourage you. I have not had a real period in two years. I have been taking Metformin 500 mg a week to this exact day and my period has come. I am very happy with this.	8	June 13, 2019	27
ACT metFORMIN (Oral)	Glucophage (metformin) for Diabetes, Type 2	I was taking Glucopgage for a number of years and the only side effects was diarrhea at least 1 to 2 times daily.  It kept my blood sugar in the low 100’s.  I finally lost about 60lbs and I no longer have diabetes even though my grandmother and mother had type 2 on insulin and my brother now has it.	10	June 2, 2019	43
ACT-traMADol/ACET (Oral)	Ultracet (acetaminophen / tramadol) for Pain	I used Ultracet 0.4 mg for my abdominal pain. But it's not very useful to me. I took one Ultracet before the pain worsened but still not provided a good relief to me. I went to the hospital after 4 hours as my pain increased gradually.	3	November 18, 2020	2
ACT-traMADol/ACET (Oral)	Pain	I’ve had an extracted tooth before but this was the first time I’d been given Tramadol/Acetaminophen for pain afterward. I literally called the pharmacist crying my head off asking what else could I take for the pain!   I don’t remember what if been given in the past; (T-3) maybe, but THIS doesn’t work at all like whatever I’d had before! I counted on this medicine to get me through the healing peacefully. It has not.	2	May 16, 2020	6
ACT-traMADol/ACET (Oral)	Pain	I have taken tramadol off an on for years. Everybody is different and everybody has different pain and different tolerances. Tramadol will help minor pain. For me it 50mg did nothing so had to take it 3 times a day I felt some relief not pain medicine for me though! But it is better than nothing everybody has their own pain levels & tramadol can treat those with minor pains & for some people who can’t handle the stronger pain pills.	4	September 29, 2019	7
ACT-traMADol/ACET (Oral)	Ultracet (acetaminophen / tramadol) for Pain	Was given this after a tooth extraction. Yeah it works for mild pains (level 4 pain and lower ). It makes me extremely groggy, but I can't seem to really sleep very long while on it. It also dehydrates me really quickly.	5	June 21, 2019	10
ACT-traMADol/ACET (Oral)	Pain	Having shoulder pain for many months went to the doctor the insurance company deny the test that he ordered and they put me on the Tramadol 35.7mg acetaminophen 325mg and it's barely touching it. I'm not sleeping so we're waiting to see what can be done	1	June 6, 2019	6
ACT-traMADol/ACET (Oral)	Ultracet (acetaminophen / tramadol) for Pain	Have been given them for hand pain, and a broken foot. It does nothing for at all.	1	November 1, 2018	13
ACT-traMADol/ACET (Oral)	Pain	I have taken it for 2 issues over last 2 years. First was a lower disc, second was a pinched nerve in neck so upper disc. Without it I could not function.   First time was 6 pills a day for 2 months. Second was 3 pills a day for 4 weeks as the pinched nerve needed less. Nothing else allowed me to  move, work, sleep. Without it with the disc issue I could not stand.   I must say coming off was hard. I went slowly down to 1 and stopped but could not sleep for 4 to 6 weeks. Feels like you drank 10 coffees before bed. Pulse in the 90s, I am  norm of 65 pulse. It is worth it for allowing me to function but I wish there was some way to avoid the withdrawral as In fear I will need again someday.  Sleeping pills and other things did not help.	8	September 30, 2018	8
ACT-traMADol/ACET (Oral)	Pain	I have been taking Tramadol for a period of ten years. A starting dosage of 300 mg daily. (100 mg 3 times daily) I have chronic pain in my shoulders, Doctors, Specialist and therapist have both told me, I have severe nerve damage in both shoulders that is not repairable, even though I am having corrective surgery to repair all the tendons, muscles, ligaments and rotator cuff that are torn and partially disconnected. I've never had an upset stomach, or an adverse reaction to the drug, fact is it immediately relieved the pain I was having and allowed me to resume a normal day's work. Addiction/Dependence? Yes I would say I was addicted to this medication. My reason as to Why? Cause it relieves the constant pain I experience 24 hrs a day. Yes I worry about all the side effects, but I AM a responsible adult and follow my doctor's direction.	10	September 11, 2018	14
ACT-traMADol/ACET (Oral)	Ultracet (acetaminophen / tramadol) for Pain	"I've been taking Ultracet 37.5mg/325mg for 12 years.  I am 74 years old.  I have arthritis in my joints and degenerative disc disorder in my lower back.  I usually take one pill early am to take the edge off my pain for most of my daily activities.  If I have ""over done it"" throughout the day, I sometime have to take a second pill at bedtime to get pain relief and sleep."	9	July 12, 2018	50
ACT-traMADol/ACET (Oral)	Ultracet (acetaminophen / tramadol) for Pain	very good I was taking 37.5mg/325mg x 2 x 4 times a day and it was very effective	9	June 25, 2018	20
ACT-traMADol/ACET (Oral)	Ultracet (acetaminophen / tramadol) for Pain	It works very fast	10	April 13, 2018	13
ACT-traMADol/ACET (Oral)	Ultracet (acetaminophen / tramadol) for Pain	I have several back and joint issues that have stemmed from degenerative joint and disc.  I take 3-4 pills daily to continue reasonable function.  I have 4 boys at home and pets.  Recently, our health insurance cut me down in coverage to 1 pill a day.  I'm in agony, level 4-5 pain now after 3 weeks of 1-1.5 pills.  Sad situation.  What do we do now? Medical procedure so expensive	8	March 22, 2018	16
ACT-traMADol/ACET (Oral)	Ultracet (acetaminophen / tramadol) for Pain	I have arthritis and I am waiting for a hip replacement. The cartilage has gone in my hip. I am walking on bone on bone with terrible pain.  I take 4 - 8 tablets a day depending on the severity of the pain. Ultracet controls the pain perfectly and I can walk almost normally. I have been on the medication for about 4 months now with no side effects. It's brilliant and I would recommend Ultracet for pain relief. It is the only painkiller that works for me.	10	December 5, 2017	28
ACT-traMADol/ACET (Oral)	Rheumatoid Arthritis	"I was originally prescribed this medication (it's called zaldiar where I live but is the same as Ultracet) when I got shingles and it helped a lot.  I've since continued to take it since I was also diagnosed with RA as it works incredibly well for me. It means the difference between controlling my pain sufficiently I can keep working, and being almost unable to function. It helps with both the pain and fatigue I feel -- when I first started to take it the effect was so profound I felt as though I was back to ""normal me"". I'm now taking 2 tablets twice a day and that's sufficient to keep everything under control most days. If I need to I can take them 3-4 times a day but that's rare for me unless I'm having a major RA flare."	9	November 12, 2017	12
ACT-traMADol/ACET (Oral)	Pain	I've been using the red capsules for several years with good results.  Recently I was given the beige capsules by amneal and they make me sick and do not reduce my pain.  There were a few white ones mixed in with the others which also worked.  I now have a bottle of beige ones which are worthless unless you want to feel worse.  And, I am unable to get any others because they're controlled and the pharmacy says beige is all they can get from their supplier..	1	November 8, 2017	3
ACT-traMADol/ACET (Oral)	Pain	This medication did not help me with my pain,  peroid. I took up to 400mg at once and still no relief but it did make me feel nauseated and gave me a headache. It's synthetic and really more like a weak antidepressant. I was prescribed it to alternate with my Hydrocodone 10mg tabs. I stopped my Norco for a 2 week period to give Tramadol a chance but it never worked. This stuff is rubish! No it's not equal to Codeine. I have taken Codeine and Tramadol is entirely different in effect. Sorry I'll stick to true Morphine based pain meds like Codeine, Hydrocodone, Oxycodone, etc. Even synthetic Darvocet worked better than this stuff!	1	May 26, 2017	9
ACT-traMADol/ACET (Oral)	Pain	Was given this for the shingles. Works great. Tends to not work as well if taken too much. Dizzy and nauseated when I move but can tolerate.	9	May 24, 2017	5
ACT-traMADol/ACET (Oral)	Pain	I was taking Norco 10-325 for back pain, after 6 years my Dr Changed to tramadol 50mg. Side effects are killing me, Now I do have a lot pain in my liver and my kidneys, nausea black stools and I wonder if I should take a attorney and sue him. 	4	April 14, 2017	12
ACT-traMADol/ACET (Oral)	Ultracet (acetaminophen / tramadol) for Pain	Take this when taking a triptan for headache pain, this is to bring baseline pain level down a few notches if I was late taking my regular abortive it usually won't work unless I can get a control on the pain, Ultracet is mildly okay at this, just a trial for headache pain as I've tried many others, but not too bad to have sometimes, can be somewhat effective.	5	April 11, 2017	8
Acalabrutinib	Calquence (acalabrutinib) for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia	Have had CLL for 10 years.  Joined early MDAnderson ACP196 trial for previously untreated 6  years ago, after having great build up of fluid around lungs.  All problems went away within a couple of months after starting treatment.  Life is normal with no side effects.  Have traveled the world since.  Still a trial participant.	10	November 7, 2020	6
Acamprosate		I am 11 days sober now after doing a 10 day community detox on librium capsules and started taking acamprosate 3 days into it.  I am 38 now and been a heavy beer drinker since I was young, drinking more and more over the years until I became dependent. Before detox the morning dry sickness and all the horrible stuff that came with it made me very ill.  I drank beers before work and during, only when the shakes kicked in or that horrible sick feeling came along!! I managed to hold down the job don't ask me how as I must of stunk of booze. I have now quit that job to take time out to get well good news going into new job soon !!  I've now finished the detox and continuing taking acamprosate 2 tabs three times a day, I find these helping me along the way - the cravings are not as bad but still come and go definitely would be worse without these tabs.  I will keep taking to keep free of the  drink wish me luck !!!	8	March 25, 2021	9
Acamprosate		I have been drinking every day for about  thirty years most days I was drunk. I have worked most of my life I was a functional alcoholic. I was tired of my continuous behaviour and  could not see a way out so I got some counselling and was prescribe acamprosate now 116 days sober know cravings and very little desire to drink	10	March 23, 2021	7
Acamprosate	Campral (acamprosate)	I've just started taking campral day one. I'm worried about the side effects??		March 20, 2021	5
Acamprosate	Campral (acamprosate)	This helped me a lot with alcohol withdrawals. Usually I will get shakes and horrible anxiety. This reduced it by half.	10	March 7, 2021	3
Acamprosate	Campral (acamprosate)	I am 67 years old and been a steady drinker since I was about 17 years old.  With the years my alcohol consumption  steadily grew more and more.  I often had plans to quit/reduce my drinking but it never lasted longer than a few days☹️ With  Covid last year changes happened and one of them was that my husband was now going to start working from home.  For us this was not the best as now we ended up drinking every day and we were consuming more as the months went on.  I reached a point where I had put on a lot of weight and I was not managing my anxiety.  I had heard of Campral from a friend of mine and went to see my GP.  Don’t think I will ever drink again as I just don’t miss it	10	March 7, 2021	9
Acamprosate	Campral (acamprosate)	I am in my second week. The medication seems to be working well for me. I have had 3 drinks since I started taking this medication. I just kinda wanted to see if I would have the same urges I used to have to keep drinking until I couldn’t anymore. Well I didn’t. I just don’t have the same desires I had in the past. I was an extremely heavy drinker normally a minimum of 30 beers per day. At 40 years old I’ve let alcohol ruin my life. Jail countless times, loss of friends and family respect. 3 years in Prison, lost jobs, you name it I’ve been there and done it. I’m very happy with this medication and have no desire to drink ever again. All I can say is I wish I knew about this medication 20 years ago. This is the only thing I feel like has ever worked for me. I’m happy now and doing the things I couldn’t do before because of my horrible physical addiction to alcohol. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to quit.	10	March 3, 2021	5
Acamprosate	Campral (acamprosate)	I was struggling trying to stay sober for a year. I would put a little time together but was struggling with daily cravings, eventually I would give in. Was active in AA following all suggestions, yet couldn’t get rid of the mental obsession to drink. I was desperate for something else to help, so I did research and the reviews here made me willing to ask my doctor and give it a try! I was feeling hopeless and this working gave me a little hope! That was 107 days ago and I haven’t had a drink since! When thoughts of a drink came to mind I was able to stop them from snowballing into an obsession to drink. I give campral the credit In allowing me to think sanely so I could really work the AA program. So grateful!! No side affects just lack of alcohol cravings! If you’re struggling like I was, talk to your doctor!!! It has helped me tremendously!	10	February 23, 2021	4
Acamprosate	Campral (acamprosate)	It worked for me for 7 weeks. I still had intense cravings but not everyday. I am in a very stressful living environment and I started drinking again. It has been 3 days having glasses of wine right before bed. I haven't stopped taking the medication. I read somewhere not to. I still believe it was the best thing but I need to he in a better environment and seek out a support group. Even though I'm very disappointed in myself, I still believe I can do this. Fingers crossed	7	February 21, 2021	2
Acamprosate		I've been drinking heavily since about 2001 been rehab at least 6 times  detox more than I remember. I've been on campral for a week on the full dose, it hasn't made a difference I'm drinking now, the doctor tells me to persist it will build up in my system but I think antabuse probably better.	3	February 16, 2021	0
Acamprosate		"This medicine is saving my life. Literally, it is the best thing in the entire world for me.  On 4th of July I had ""one drink"". That turned into... you can guess the story... I found a psychiatrist and told him I'm an alcoholic, help me! We tried naltrexone first but I had an allergic reaction in my lungs (I have a rare lung disease.) Next we tried this and I built up to 6 pills a day. As the weeks went by, I found it REALLY does work. I have only had a strong craving twice, and it was fleeting.  Both times, I had forgotten my mid day dose. It seems to make me happier,  too. More motivated and enthused about life, and less grouchy from craving drinks. You must have willpower to keep taking it.  If you don't, I'm pretty sure you're able to get drunk. Do yourself the biggest favor. Take this, religiously. We all know, one drink is too many, and a thousand is never enough."	10	February 10, 2021	2
Acamprosate		I had been drinking heavily for many years and I am 38 , decided ring up GP for medicine help for my alcohol craving, he offers me acamprosate and told me I did need to have some will power if I didn't have any will power then the medicine may not work as well. The first 6 day I take the medicine I have a lot alcohol craving even dream about alcohol but the craving don’t last so long like 5 minutes and come back like 20 minutes keep craving on and off it make me wonder does this medicine even worked. Then I go online reading the reviews of the medicine it says that it takes some time to work.  Now I am on my week 3 sober and I won’t say it easy and craving still come back but I say without the medicine I can’t even write this review because I will be drunk or black out. I am hopeful stay sober for good with acamprosate.	10	February 4, 2021	2
Acamprosate	Campral (acamprosate)	I just turned 48 and have been drinking for over 35 years. Over the past 30 years, I have drunk every day probably only going without a nightly drink 10 times per year. I tried Naltrexone twice, the first time it worked the second time my body didn’t recognise it. 30 days ago I started taking Campral, 2 tabs 3 times a day. I have now stopped drinking. Amazing drug.	10	January 31, 2021	15
Acamprosate		I become increasingly alcohol dependent over the last 10 years. I realised I had a problem when I started thinking about alcohol in the mornings and started planning my day around alcohol. I was drinking an average of 10 standard drinks a night and struggled having a rest day, so made myself seek help.  I’ve been on campral 6 tablets daily for approx 6 months now. It wasn’t a miracle drug for me at first at all - it reduced my cravings and takes the edge off weaning off alcohol - but it seems to quietly strengthen your will power and ability to dramatically cut down.  I only feel that now - 6 months later - I’m at a really good place. I currently drink probably 2-3 times per week and rarely drink more than 4 standard drinks.  Cravings are now few and far between. I can drive past bottle shops, I don’t wear myself out fighting the thoughts of buying alcohol and drinking it, and I’m savings between $100-200 per week.	7	January 26, 2021	3
Acamprosate		I tried Naltrexone and that didn't work for my alcohol problem. So my doctor prescribed Campral for cravings. And although it did eliminate cravings for alcohol, the side effects were horrific. Dizziness, nausea, splitting headache and severe cramping. I stopped taking after 2 days! To top it off, the script cost $126 and of course, I can't return for refund.	10	January 24, 2021	0
Acamprosate		I would drink a bottle of red wine at least a night and have done for many years. Trying to stop drinking in the past worked for a few days and then I'd feel great for having a break and then get straight back on the wine. Acamprosate is amazing. I haven't drank now for 2 weeks and most importantly, I have no desire to. I now sleep very well and deeply and have a buzz each day at work. There is no desire to drink when I get home. Something has reset in my brain and furthermore there are no side effects. It seems to me that my former thought-process of wanting to have a drink has been erased, or at least has been rendered unimportant to my sub-conscious being. Acamprosate works for me. I'm very pleased.	10	January 7, 2021	17
Acamprosate	Campral (acamprosate)	I've been a alcoholic for years 64 years old now in an out of rehabs detox 4 times in the last year, hospital 2 times jail 1 all in a year.  My doc noticed my blood tests showed liver problems ended up several test later was contacted by liver doc who told me I had the beginning of liver failure and advised that I start Campral been 54 days sober not looking back feel better and hope my liver heals. You can do it if I can	10	November 17, 2020	54
Acamprosate		Parent, full-time teacher, part-time PhD student and was drinking a bottle a night for about two years. I hate myself for letting booze get the better of me. Taking the med acamprosate for 4 days now and haven't touched alcohol since. However, I feel so tired, irritable, unmotivated and have no appetite. I hope these side-effects go away soon. I felt happier when I was drinking, but I know it was no good for me or my family. Just hope I don't end up a zombie, going through the motions every day without any joy aside from having better health.	7	November 4, 2020	6
Acamprosate	Campral (acamprosate)	I was a heavy drinker since I was 16. I am now 42 and have been an alcoholic for the past 10 years. After a week of binge drinking I ended up in hospital. This was 5 months ago. After detoxification I was prescribed Campral. 2 tabs, 3 x day.  I haven’t had a drink since. I can now go to the pub with friends and am happy to drink soda water.   I never thought I’d make it to this stage	10	August 16, 2020	89
Acamprosate		I'm a 48 year old male who's been an alcoholic almost all my life. Coming from the UK with its drinking culture I always thought it was normal to go the pub everyday. I guess I was drinking 10 pints everyday when I was 18 years old, more on weekends. I was a 'functioning alcoholic for about 10 years.  My drinking gradually got worst and by my 30's I was drinking neat vodka. I started to drink in the mornings before work. I started to lose jobs, got arrested for being drunk too many times to remember, lost my driving licence 3 times in 15 years, the last time I was sent to prison. No matter how hard  I tried, I couldn't stop. I tried AA, rehab. Eventually 13 months ago I did another detox, only this time I was given Acamprosate after my detox. I haven't had 1 craving for alcohol in 13 months. I stopped taking it 2 months ago and I still don't have any cravings. This is a miracle. Please give it a try if you are suffering with alcoholism.	10	May 20, 2020	54
Acamprosate	Campral (acamprosate)	Campral truly is a miracle drug for me. I had 20 years sober. 12 step meetings kept me clean. However, I went through serious health issues, a bad divorce and subsequent abusive relationship. I drank in 2018, but within a month of drinking I ended up in the ER, which motivated me to stay sober for 2 months. Drank again almost against my will! I was prescribed Antabuse and Campral...stayed sober another few months. I stopped taking the Campral, mostly because my crappy Medicare didn't cover my monthly script, which was $100. I wasn't going to meetings either. I know the Campral worked. I could walk by a liquor store and have no interest going in. I quit again because of my health and family. Only problem is it took a week to work. I'd take Antabuse but, like with the Campral, Medicare expects me to pay $90/month. I am committed to taking the Campral. It's been 5 days no drink. I don't have the desire. Only side effect I had was occasional diarrhea.	10	January 25, 2020	62
Acamprosate	Campral (acamprosate)	Campral has been a “miracle” drug for me and my alcohol. I’ve been an on & off drinker my entire life and realized it was hurting me. Burying a few friends sharpened my focus. Now, just over 2 months into zero booze... I feel much better. Campral helped me through the danger zone: 5 to 8:00 PM eating dinner & watching TV. The craving and temptation seem to have disappeared- my only side effect is flatulence- easy to deal with. I also practice HALT (hungry, angry, lonely, tired) to warn me against a relapse. Campral works. Two 333 tabs three times daily.	10	January 18, 2020	79
Acamprosate	Campral (acamprosate)	I’m a mid 60 year old degrees engineer with a very good life.  I have a good job and boss and even greater wife and family. I’ve been drinking since a freshman in undergraduate- this increased when I went in the military and has since been sort of up and down over the years.   Since hitting 60 I noticed I was drinking more- a definite tolerance was developed. I have quit cold turkey at least three times- and each withdrawal was worse- the last was very bad so I reached out to my physician, was completely honest & since it had been four days since my last glass of wine- he recommended Campral, two tablets, three times daily - I’ve been careful to stay on the precise dosage schedule.  For me, this medicine is WORKING (all caps on purpose). The cravings, though this is a subjective rating, have diminished considerably. I’m not rushing to get home to have a drink now, and I feel more alert or “brighter.	10	January 4, 2020	69
Acamprosate		I had a medical detox in August 19 and have been on Acamprosate since then, 6 tablets of 333mg a day. I was drinking up to a litre of vodka a day and was unable to go a day or two without. Mainly drinking in the mornings at work as the jobs were not difficult, although obviously making mistakes when I topped up too much in my breaks. So far no real urges to drink as I really don't want to go back to where I was and what I lost from it, especially in the last 6 years- sackings from work / break-up from a partner of 15 years / & not being there for my son. My worry / question is what happens when I stop taking it? My clinic said to take for 8-12 months, will it stop working and the urges come back? The cost to me is £10 a month in the UK.	10	January 3, 2020	23
Acamprosate		acamprosate is exceptional for alcohol issues in it's effectiveness & lack of side effects. I'm only 3 months in but my goal was Xmas day yet here we are past that date & I'm looking forward to reaching the 1 year mark. Yes it does take some willpower but hardly any in comparison to cold turkey.  Gives you the strength to not want to have to face day one ever again.  It's easy, you eat these pills 3 times a day and no longer are you a slave to the poison. First 8 days are tough because you feel as with every time you sober up you're missing out. Next 8 days you note small mental changes. 1 month = no more explaining to friends as they all now know. Second month takes time but with a few challenges passed with ease you start to feel exceptional.  Month 3, well it's been great as everyone around me still gets sloshed & I'm happy for them with no regrets or feelings of being a wowser.  Stoked to be free of the dependency it commanded.  I want this drug to be advertised to the world, it's the ultimate	10	December 27, 2019	29
Acamprosate	Campral (acamprosate)	I have been on Campral for 7 days for alcohol issues. The first 6 were very difficult as I was still craving to drink. I had one nip on day 6. It made me feel nothing and I didn't want another. Then finally the next day on day 7. No cravings! I've been a on/off drinker and binge/blackout drinker for the last 39 years. I am 54 yrs old. I've tried Campral several times  in the past but couldn't last more than a few days on it. So finally I've made it to day 7 with only 1 nip and I feel a huge difference. I also feel calmer as I normally have a lot of anxiety. I'm sure as the days go on it will only get better from here as long as I keep taking it.	8	November 4, 2019	75
Acamprosate	Campral (acamprosate)	I was told Campral would take 5-8 days to start working for my alcohol issues. It took all 8 days to notice the reduction in cravings & it was very tough that first week to white-knuckle through the drinking urges. Previously I had started Campral but not made it a full week many times before, making a waste of the expensive attempts that only lasted 3, 4 or 5 days on previous tries.  But this time I made it to 8 days, and I definitely notice that the urge to drink has decreased and is finally manageable. I don’t quite have cravings at this point, more like longings, almost of nostalgia for the escape. But alcohol was killing me and I am finally at a place where I can manage the desire and not give in to it. I credit Campral for that.  The downsides have been the high cost (my insurance covers it partially) and the length of time til it worked for me. But previously I tried Antabuse and Naltrexone and those ultimately failed. Campral seems like it could work. Good luck to everyone who needs this medication.	8	October 19, 2019	69
Acamprosate		LIFE SAVING.  For the last 10 years I drank 4-6 drinks in the evenings on weekdays, and 6-8 on weekends.  And the cravings were starting to happen in the morning - at work etc.  I knew I had to stop drinking.  But stopping was always horrible.  I would always get triggered or stressed and go back to the Gin.  Within a day of taking this medication I have lost 90% of my desire to drink.    Why this isn't a FAMOUS drug for alcoholics is a mystery to me.  In my opinion our culture is addicted to BLAMING alcoholics.  This drug is great and works for alcoholics. Good ol' puritanical guilt tripping at its finest.	10	October 11, 2019	27
Acamprosate		I was an almost daily drinker for 10 years (binge and social drinker before). I knew I was slowly dying, felt like garbage all the time, and had a constant internal battle of drinking, not drinking or recovering from drinking. I have been on Campral for 10 months now and haven't had or craved a drink. That was impossible to imagine before. I take 666 mgs daily (started at 333 mgs) and haven't had any side effects aside from mild gastro stuff at the beginning. I use it with therapy and support as recommended. For me, it's been a wonder drug.	10	October 8, 2019	21
Acamprosate		Been taking for 1 week  and my cravings and desire for alcohol have dramatically decreased to a manageable level.  Bonus my blood glucose have averaged below 100 and stayed within 70-120 for 97% in target since my last drink.	10	October 7, 2019	12
Acamprosate	Campral (acamprosate)	I have been a very heavy drinker for 20yrs,  a bottle of vodka a day, I would get withdrawal seizures and tried detox and rehab several times. The first couple of times I was put on campral, I could feel the effects of the cravings going away but mind over matter made me pick up the drink. Now, I guess it's different for some people, I can so much easier refuse a drink as I'm happier to sit with my emotions than go there, and if I was not on campral I don't believe it would be possible and definitely nowhere near as easy for me. I thoroughly recommend it if you are willing to try anything to get your life back or some form of normality, and not use of alcohol for a crutch, campral will help immensely. Best of luck to is all	10	October 5, 2019	72
Acamprosate	Campral (acamprosate)	This medication did absolutely nothing at all to stop me craving alcohol. I am so disappointed as I expected it to work.	1	September 11, 2019	20
Acamprosate	Campral (acamprosate)	I am 5 days into my first week of Campral 333 mg 3x a day. I am careful to stay on a schedule of 6 am, 2 pm,  and 10 pm. So far all seems well. Idk if this was a placebo effect but I was NOT craving a drink from the first night.  My drinking has escalated over the past 8-10 years from just a couple drinks on weekends to nightly drinks that led to hangovers 2 or 3 times a week and blackouts a couple of times a month.  Breaking free from alcohol is something I truly desire and this seems to be giving me the help that I've needed. I have noticed that my dreams have been very lucid and disturbing; hoping this goes away. Either way, I'm sticking with it.	10	August 25, 2019	87
Acamprosate	Campral (acamprosate)	Just got my  first prescription of Acamprosate. I'm reading these post. I've noticed some people say it didn't work for them but none of them say what dosage or if they were taking it as prescribed. So those post do not look honest. Please input your daily dosage, how many times a day and for how long.   For my self I will follow the prescription and check back with. God bless and wish me luck.		August 15, 2019	52
Acamprosate	Campral (acamprosate)	I’ve suffered every type of consequence from drinking including pancreatitis, cardiac arrest, and a stroke but each time something health wise or another negative situation happened, it was never enough to make me quit drinking. I just got out of rehab again, but this time I heard about Campral, and figured I had nothing to lose so I agreed to try it. Although it’s only been a month I don’t crave alcohol at all. I think I might make it this time.	9	August 13, 2019	127
Acamprosate	Campral (acamprosate)	Miracle.  Been taking Campral about 4 days and I’m already seeing great benefits.  The last few years I’ve been a heavy drinker due to a lot of trauma in my life.  I’m 42 now.  I was always able to quit but it never lasted no matter AA meetings I went to, shrinks, etc, I think mostly because not drinking made me anxious, racing thoughts, worry, irritable, tired, depressed, angry, lonely, etc.  I stumbled onto this med after finally going back to my GP.  I had no idea it even existed and I researched the internet for years looking for something to ease my symptoms.  I’ve been alcohol free a couple of weeks now but feel COMPLETELY different.  No more bad symptoms!  It’s gotta be this medication.  It makes you wonder if the booze companies lobby to suppress this drug’s existence.  That’s how helpful it’s been for me.  I’ve taken antidepressants, anti anxiety, etc and this now is all I need!  I hope Campral works for anyone else needing and begging for help  for their alcohol dependence or being a alcoholic  like I was, it really is the drug that works for alcoholism. 	10	August 11, 2019	131
Acamprosate		I went to 4 rehabs of the ‘best’ rehabs in the nation- betty ford, hazledon, father Martin Ashley . Relapsed every time I got home. I felt extremely low and depressed. WTH couldn’t I stay sober! I was headed back for a wonderful 5th visit and decided give campral a go since I had some campral lying around. I was astounded. The desire to drink simply disappeared. That angry itch that once demanded to be scratched was non existent. I didn’t go to the rehab and just stayed sober. I attend meetings just to be around other people who struggle, but in the past meetings didn’t stop the endless longing to drink. For meetings make the desire worse since all they talk about is drinking! This medication liberated me from the constant obsession of booze. As someone who has spent over 100k trying to sober up I urge you to give this medication a shot if you are struggling. It is not a placebo in any sense. Thanks for letting me share.	10	July 31, 2019	30
Acamprosate	Campral (acamprosate)	After many years in and out of ana and relapsing and huge consequences due to my drinking. I can now say I literally do not feel like having a drink. Even the thought is just passing. I’ve noticed also I’m losing weight. And not wanting to smoke as much. I feel more upbeat. I do listen to AA  meetings in the evening.  It disheartens me to so many people struggling and this is like a miracle cure to get a big chunk of sobriety in the beginning of being sober. It wouldn’t surprise me if the alcohol companies have invested in keeping this quiet. A very good modern drug. I recommend it to anyone who is struggling in early recovery	9	July 19, 2019	82
Acamprosate	Campral (acamprosate)	Awesome!   Campral is working great after 2 weeks no desire to drink!	10	July 17, 2019	49
Acamprosate	Campral (acamprosate)	I am a 36 yr old mother of 3, lots of history of abuse (sexual,emotional,mental) perpetrated by family members, father and ex husband, have a history of depression and anxiety. Have been drinking alcohol to excess for 16 yrs.  I could go without alcohol,(a 6-10 pack of rum and cola cans) if pressed but would always feel ‘joyless,’ hard done by, anxiety ridden, depressed.. Being a smoker as well, my health was starting to deteriorate quickly..  Attempts, including going to AA, Valium to help with the ‘witching hour,’ self control, never worked.  I thought I was going to die from the drink, I was beginning to want to, the awful life that I have endured, in my head for so long was becoming unbearable.  I started Campral 7 days ago, I haven’t wanted an alcoholic drink (or cigarette!!) since the night before taking my first dose! This is my miracle!!!!!  I honestly cannot believe it, it’s like I have never been addicted to anything, like I’ve been released from insanity..  CRAZY!!	10	June 20, 2019	132
Acamprosate		Four days in and my husband has shown no signs of giving up drinking. He’s been on naltrexone and now this, I’ve given up hope that anything will ever work and it’s ruining my life. I wish we could share a success story like most of the others here	2	June 11, 2019	9
Acamprosate	Campral (acamprosate)	Thank you for sharing your theme, I have started Campral today, I feel teary and not looking forward to my first act at stopping, which I will try hard from now on.  		June 8, 2019	36
Acamprosate	Campral (acamprosate)	I sought  specialist assistance eventually for my alcohol dependence . I took librium and then campral and generally with support did 3 years sober until my mums wake in May 2017. It creeps up on you and before you know your dependant again. I've got a supported detox arranged for  me after my 50th and intend to take campral again after librium detox. I strongly recommend you take time off work and be proactive in seeking support. Take a good look at your habits and strategize. I was at my happiest sober. Didn't even think about it after a while.  I realised I wasn't boring and I hadn't lost my sense if fun. In fact I had more energy to have fun and lost loads of weight, so I am really looking forward to that one. It's nothing to be ashamed of it's a courageous move often admired. I'm really looking forward to my break of what prevents me from doing things I want to do. If you fall of the wagon then suss out why. Get support and pull socks up again. Ignore the stigma! Good luck to me and you. We rock for trying to break cycle 	8	April 30, 2019	110
Acamprosate		Exactly the same experience as Sober Dave, word for word. One week in taking acamprosate and NO DRINKING, I have now realized why I have been drinking and I am positive about working on making my life better, where as it felt impossible before.	10	April 25, 2019	9
Acamprosate	Campral (acamprosate)	After a decade of heavy Vodka drinking,  I levelled with my doctor who, at my request put me on Campral.    I lowered my alcohol in take for 8  days to 3 oz a day then began the Campral.  I'm in disbelief how on the first day I felt euphoric!  I had a therapy session which is important for me now.  This works, why don't people talk about this more.  Some said it took a few days I am grateful.  Day 2  feel alive and Brave.		April 23, 2019	58
Acamprosate	Campral (acamprosate)	Hi,   I just wanted to share my experience regarding taking Campral for my drinking. At first, I was skeptical that it would work. My wife has been telling me about this medication for a while now.  I have been a heavy drinker; my weekly consumption would be a 3-4 700ml bottle of Vodka. Some nights I would black out and not remember a thing.  Since taking Campral for 1 month now, I do have some cravings but not enough to start back up again. I highly recommend this medication to anyone who wants to give up or cut down drinking.   Talk to your doctors as they can recommend what steps need to be taken.	10	April 22, 2019	49
Acamprosate		I’ve been drinking heavily for 15 years, I’m 34. Fought in 2 wars, multiple times. I only feel normal when I drink. I’ve been taking this drug for over a week. The second day I relapsed but picked my self up.... literally and continued taking it but at the same time digging deep, not to drink. Today a blizzard blew into Denver and everything was closed down so I was bored and had cravings. I went and bought a fifth of vodka my usual nightly consumption. I got home poured a big glass. It sat there for hours I had no desire to drink it. Unfortunately I’m cheap so I am currently drinking it because otherwise it’d be a waste. That being said I’m surprised that I actually felt that way. I feel hope. I will pick myself up tomorrow and keep on keepin on.		April 11, 2019	11
Acamprosate		I've been taking Acamprosate for about 18 days now and it has definitely decreased my cravings. With that said, it also makes me very drowsy to the point of where waking up is very difficult. It also has made me weak and sluggish. I have been more clumsy probably because of those things. Mild headaches also make an appearance from time to time, but they mostly last a short while. Even with all of these side effects I think it is a well worth medication to try for who ever is ready to be done with drinking. (alcoholic of 25 years)	7	March 12, 2019	10
Acamprosate		I’ve been on Acamprosate for three weeks and still crave alcohol as much as ever. All I want to do is sleep and I feel tired all of the time. After about a week my mood changed and all I want to do is rant and rave about everything and to everyone. I will probably quit taking the pills and see if my mood goes back to normal. It is causing havoc with my family. I have chosen not to get counselling, but might have to if I don’t start feeling better. This experience is worse than being an alcoholic. I think it either works well or not at all, and unfortunately, it is not working for me.	1	March 8, 2019	6
Acamprosate	Campral (acamprosate)	I have been drinking heavily for 2yrs, I'm 39years old, its killing me, I have had a past DUI, broke leg after falling while drunk, only day 2 for me, I hope it works, I need to stop or alcohol will be demise. I would drink until I blacked out. I pray that it works.	5	March 2, 2019	42
Acamprosate	Campral (acamprosate)	Greenpea...don't lose hope at all.  I have done a ton of research and it takes up to three weeks to begin to change your brain chemical  imbalance and restore the neurotransmitters...keep taking it!! You can do it!		January 29, 2019	54
Acamprosate	Campral (acamprosate)	I have been taking six 333mg Campral daily and have so far been sober for 270 days.  For the first few weeks I was sceptical but trust me after a month you won't look back.  Not only is it so easy to refuse a drink, I just don't feel like one.  Since 9 months ago when I had my last drink I've lost 20kg just from the lack of extra bad carbs and sugars.  I feel amazing and I thank the campral for turning my life around.   I drunk about 10-15 units daily for years.  Not a massive drinker but a regular one (like most Aussies). I needed to give up but failed every time.  Campral has made it so easy and I don't even think about drinking.  If you're reading this and doing research I 100% recommend you see a doc and see about going on campral.   You won't look back. Only $38 a month in Australia too...	10	January 26, 2019	96
Acamprosate	Campral (acamprosate)	This is my third day and I am impressed. I have been a heavy drinker (1-2 bottles of wine per day) for the last 20 years. Before Campral I was constantly having withdrawal symptoms of severe anxiety, depression, guilt of not doing anything right and not recalling anything at all- my memory was shot!  It’s only day 3 but I feel good: less anxious, not shaky. I do sweat lots at night but that is it. So far, it is great. I hope I can get my memory back and stay sober. Good luck to all.	9	January 22, 2019	90
Acamprosate	Campral (acamprosate)	Been taking this since Friday. Maybe it’s not enough time? But right now I’m drinking a glass of red and enjoying it. I went to my local store and just couldn’t help myself :-(.  I really really wanted this pill to work. I’m heart broken.		January 21, 2019	21
Acamprosate		I have been a heavy drinker for 20 years.  I just started on campral 1 week ago, this medicine is working for me, no cravings  for alcohol whatsoever so far...early days yet, but so far so good.	10	January 13, 2019	10
Acamprosate		This drug has really helped me stay sober, I didn't have a sudden miracle moment but realised that I am not constantly craving alcohol and I can now cope with grocery shopping and meals out with company without wanting to drink. I am also having Therapy. I am a 48 year old female	9	December 21, 2018	13
Acamprosate	Campral (acamprosate)	I see from other reviews this medicine seems to work 100% or not at all. I'm in the lucky category, along with my husband who is taking it too. We are 37 and 40 years old and have been highly functioning heavy drinkers for the last ~ 10 years. We regularly have 3 - 6 drinks a day on weekdays and maybe 5 to 8 drinks on weekend days. We started taking Campral just a few days ago, and I feel like a different person already. Miraculously, it takes the desire to drink away completely. I can hardly explain it.  I went to a restaurant today where people were enjoying martinis and wine all around me, and I wasn't the least bit tempted. Nighttime has historically been difficult when trying to quit, and we have not had any desire to drink. It's a miracle for us, and I'm excited to see how much our life will change in the coming months, as alcohol has been the center of our universe for a long time. I can't recommend this enough for anyone feeling dependent on alcohol. Good luck to all.	10	December 20, 2018	102
Acamprosate	Campral (acamprosate)	"For me the old-fashioned, puritanical ""Alcoholics-Anonymous"" approach is a joke.  There IS medication for alcoholism.  Alcoholism is a genetic thing...not a lack of character development.  Take this medicine - it actually works!!!!!"	10	October 16, 2018	94
Acamprosate	Campral (acamprosate)	"I started the meds about 4 days ago. Went 2 days without drinking but cravings overwhelmed me. Of course I felt ashamed and like a hopeless failure. I hope that it will help me as much as all of these commenters. Maybe it will kick in with a little time. I""m desperate. Going to AA and to a therapist. Trying. Wish me luck."		October 15, 2018	49
Acamprosate	Campral (acamprosate)	55 year old. Drinking heavily for fifteen years. Tried campral for three months. OK to begin with but as it built up in my system it completely numbed all of my senses. I am normally an upbeat, happy person but it made me feel down all the time, tired, couldn't be bothered doing anything, lost interest in friends and family, memory loss to the point where I'd be having a conversation and couldn't recall words. And, probably the most embarrassing symptom, was that the muscle relaxant effect made me wet the bed twice which I have never done before (not alcohol induced). On researching this I saw that it is a common side effect but largely goes unreported for obvious reasons. It did however reduce my drinking, mainly because I was spaced out and zombified on campral and didn't need further intoxication.	2	October 10, 2018	34
Acamprosate		"So, I was released from voluntary 51/50 ( a stay in hospital or institution) I'm a ""3 tall cans a night"" type of gal. The med is fantastic! I have no desire to drink. Only down side? I had a reaction to it. Ended up in the E.R.. I don't want to give up. I have hives. The Dr at the E.R. was no help. He just said, ""It's up to you, stop taking it or not."" help I don't wanna stop taking it but I also don't wanna die.   My throat closed up.  I need to look at other option like 	naltrexone, or antabuse."	10	September 27, 2018	3
Acamprosate	Campral (acamprosate)	I’m ashamed to say I was drinking too much .... I went voluntarily to my doctor for help and she suggested Campral along with counselling.  I had read the reviews and side effects etc and thought ok I’ll give it a try.   I HONESTLY can’t believe how this has worked for me.  It’s only been two weeks on Campral but I did change my drinking habits prior to starting Campral with a week completely off alcohol.  I don’t feel much desire to drink and  I had previously dreaded nighttime and weekends that had been the hardest for me but the Campral  worked so far.  I know every one is different  but I would urge you to give it a go , I just wish this was prescribed to my sister who sadly passed 8 years ago with alcohol dependence being a main factor, I’m sure it would have helped.   Good luck to all on their journey	10	September 20, 2018	51
Acamprosate	Campral (acamprosate)	I just started it and am feeling shaky and nauseous.  I also have a headache but am not sure if it's related.  Any guidance is greatly appreciated.  I'm not sure if I can keep taking it if it makes me feel this way.		September 17, 2018	14
Acamprosate		It’s day two on Campral and it’s working ,but I am so bloated. Just wondering how long dies this side effect goes on for.	7	September 10, 2018	0
Acamprosate	Campral (acamprosate)	"This drug is an absolute miracle and a literal lifesaver. Like many here, I tried many times over the years to ""white knuckle"" getting sober and tried several rehabilitation programs, including AA. I was racked with guilt for being a failure and my marriage was on the rocks, to say the least. I'd be motivated to get clean, but always found a way be back to my old, heavy drinking ways pretty quickly.   With Campral, I simply have no real desire to drink. While my ""relapses"" used to be nightmarish, week-long benders, my one slip on Campral was just that -- a day where I had a few drinks. The next day -- no desire to drink and just back to life as normal.   No side effects I've ever noticed, except that I've lost a lot of weight from not drinking (a good thing in my case). I have no idea why this isn't prescribed as THE go-to medication for anyone struggling. Eleven stars if that were an option."	10	August 21, 2018	66
Acamprosate		I was prescribed this in my 65th year. It worked very well but I have relapsed. Now I need it again but can't get a prescription in the UK .  Can anyone help me with how long I need NOT to drink before taking it again.   If I can't get in prescribed can  anyone suggest an alternative? Thanks	8	August 8, 2018	6
Acamprosate	Campral (acamprosate)	Hi I have been drinking since I was 15 years old and I am now 37 years old. It has only got worse as the years went on. To be honest, drinking 12/15 cans a night maybe 5 times a week.  Then I was introduced to campral and I said to myself why not.  I am not getting any younger plus my health is getting worse, so I started my first day today, so hopefully they work for me , it is only my first day so it too early to say much about my cravings, but I got thru today  so ok I suppose		August 7, 2018	18
Acamprosate	Campral (acamprosate)	I've been a heavy drinker for 25 years+.  Since my early 20's, I drank a magnum of wine daily. About four years ago, my Dr.s wanted me to stop. I've been to detox three times, inpatient once, intensive outpatient program (IOP) twice, DUI at 40, and fatty liver disease. AA is not my thing because I have social phobia I tried Antabuse but always relapsed with it still in my system.  Recently, I was on Vivitrol but drank the same amount, if not more.  I was starting to drink a fifth in one night, and I knew I couldn't continue because was killing me slowly.  My Dr suggested Campral.  My cravings aren't there and it's only been five days, but I've never had this experience before.  Usually, I'm climbing the walls in one way or another, and in the last few years, I've gained 50 pounds because I kept replacing alcohol with food every time I had sobriety.  This is different.  I just don't care about alcohol, and my family drinks heavily, and there are gallon bottles of booze on the counters.	9	July 20, 2018	53
Acamprosate	Campral (acamprosate)	I am 2 1/2 yrs sober. I did 16 weeks of treatment in early 2016 and 2+ yrs of weekly therapy along with weekly aftercare meetings. I still go to therapy just not as often. With all that said, I was on campral for the first year and then discontinued use and was fine. I've been back on it for 2 months as I was in a car accident in March 2018. My cravings since the accident were mostly for opioids but since I was familiar with how campral works in my body I chose to be put back on it instead of something for opioid cravings. Campral has helped save my life twice. I'll stay on it this time until things mellow out.  I guess why I'm writing this review is to tell people that this medications can help with cravings but the reasons why you used in the first place need to be addressed as well. I never would of stayed sober if I hadn't worked on my self to. This is a wonderful medication that works in tandem with other means of staying sober.	10	July 5, 2018	48
Acamprosate	Campral (acamprosate)	Doesn’t seem to work for me all that much. I’ve been on this a while 2 tablets of 333MG three times a day. It caused me to have allergic reactions too, such as hives and itching. The shakiness  (DT's )still has not gone away. I’m 22 days sober today from alcohol dependence. Prior to that I was clean for 60+ days and had a relapse only over the course of 8 days. So this detox shouldn’t be bad. Even with all these meds that I’m taking my anxiety becomes overwhelming sometimes and I feel like picking up a drink however I still haven’t and want to remain sober. So my doctor prescribed me a low does of Librium (25MG) and told me to take 1-2 times a day just until my symptoms are under control. I was taking visteral but it didn’t help enough for me personally. For me this alcohol craving pill might as well be a sugar pill	3	June 26, 2018	9
Acamprosate		Yes, it works! I am from India and  have been a daily drinker for 10 years. Before starting acamprosate (Brand name Acamprol in my country), I detoxed for 5 days on benzos and then started its daily dose of 2*3. Cravings almost vanished within 2 days. On the 5th day I sat with friends who were having booze and couldn't care less to even look at it, forget thinking about it. Yesterday I ran short of its supply and by evening I was thinking of alcohol again. Will get my refill as soon as I finish this review. Give it a try, it works. I won't care even if I have to take it for a year, may be half the dose I will switch to. Give it a try guys. God bless.	9	June 24, 2018	11
Acamprosate	Campral (acamprosate)	I had relapsed 4-5 times after my first serious attempt to stop drinking. After starting campral, I have 7 months sober. I read these comments before starting and I’m glad I did. It’s working, I can walk into a liquor store and buy a soda! Cravings only appear during high stress, and they’re easier to fight now. They should try this on every alcoholic!	10	June 13, 2018	44
Acamprosate	Campral (acamprosate)	"I started taking Campral while in a treatment facility.  I was unable to tolerate naltrexone.  Although both addicted to alcohol and opioids the Campral is only used for alcohol dependence but this drug is nothing but amazing.  I have no cravings!  I take 666 mg. 3 times per day.  Started on 333 mg. I think this drug is best in a combination with cognitive behavioural therapy and a program such as AA or NA.  You have to want to deal with the addiction.  Nothing is a ""magic bullet"" I highly recommend this medication."	9	May 31, 2018	33
Acamprosate	Campral (acamprosate)	This drug has not been helpful. I have not taken it 3 times a day as prescribed though. I have had my usual amount of alcohol every day since I started it.  Today I am starting again ( for the hundredth time). I am going to take all three doses today. Starting to think there’s no help for me.	1	May 28, 2018	9
Acamprosate	Campral (acamprosate)	I have been reading the reviews for Campral for over a year and finally got over the embarrassment and asked my doctor. I started it four weeks ago and haven’t had a drink in three weeks. I knew there was no way I could go the recommended 5 days without alcohol because I’ve tried and the withdrawals were debilitating. So, I started it while I was still drinking. After a couple days on it I I had no desire to have beer, wine, margarita, nothing. I was drinking an entire bottle of wine and 6-7 beers nightly. And on the weekends I started drinking as soon as I finished my coffee and drank until blackout. Now, a month in I self-lowered my dose to 1/3 of what I started with and still no craving or withdrawal. I may be done even taking the rest of what I have left. Now I have the will power to even be around people drinking and just have a soda or tea. This medicine saved my life. For reference I’m a 40 year old female.	10	May 24, 2018	73
Acamprosate	Campral (acamprosate)	This is my second week only on Campral and since yesterday I don’t feel like drinking. I have no urge. I know is early days but I have been drinking since I was 15 now I’m 64 and the last three years I have been drinking close to 16 l of red wine . I’m so happy. I hope it continues. I will update again soon.		May 3, 2018	40
Acamprosate	Campral (acamprosate)	I had been a heavy drinker ever since I was about 19 or 20. I would drink pretty much any alcohol - to extreme every day. In the end I was drinking around 2 litres of port each day. Sometimes also wine, champagne, beer and/or spirits. Anything really, to excess.  I'm now 59 & have been alcohol-free for almost 2 years & no longer have any desire whatsoever to drink, thanks to Campral.  It truly is easy! I didn't need to join AA or have counselling or support groups. I did it by myself with just a little encouragement from my kids every now & then.  I honestly can't recommend it highly enough. I am no longer a dying alcoholic. My liver has returned from being just pre-cirrhosis and inches away from liver failure back to completely 100% healthy and normal.  Good luck & I hope this helps others who are caught up in that alcohol-dependent nightmare. :) xxx	10	April 7, 2018	87
Acamprosate		This med worked EXTREMELY well taking away completely my craving for alcohol.	10	March 28, 2018	7
Acamprosate	Campral (acamprosate)	Am 73 and have been consistent drinker since 18 and would love $1 for every hangover over those years. The  secret is after  taking this for 3-4 days you just don’t think about drinking and you no longer crave or miss it . It’s like when observing others who are regular full on daily boozers, thinking they don’t know what life is really about and they are shackled somehow and ruining  and missing out on life’s real genuine pleasures and purposes. I now have just as much enjoyment with still social /heavy drinker friends by just having a tea or coffee and have for first time since I was a kid some real respect and confidence in myself.	10	March 25, 2018	42
Acamprosate	Campral (acamprosate)	I waited for 5 days without alcohol. Tomorrow will be my start date. I plan to update weekly History is over a third of my life alcoholic	10	February 3, 2018	19
Acamprosate		First time in 3 years I haven’t had a drink for 3 weeks....but most importantly I haven’t WANTED to drink. I truly thought I was destined to keep destroying myself and my families lives forever. I’d given up hope! I must say though I have taken this med before DURING a drinking binge and it does very little but once you have made a decision to stop completely it’s amazing.....0 cravings and a total indifference to alcohol when I am around it! Only side effect I had was a bit of drowsiness and forgetfulness which soon disappeared  Give it a try!!	10	February 2, 2018	3
Acamprosate	Campral (acamprosate)	I was put on campral and coming up to 10 weeks without a drink. Was drinking to blackout 4/5 times a week . Not sure how it works but it is sure not doing any harm. I also had a strong desire to stop (this has failed me many times before though) No side effects. Certainly glad I have tried it.	8	February 2, 2018	24
Acamprosate	Campral (acamprosate)	I started using Campral 7 months + ago to help me stop drinking and it has been a godsend. It’s still taken some effort but been much much easier than I’d dared hope. I’m getting my life back and changing it as well. I don’t ever want go back. If you are thinking about quitting  drinking then this med is worth a try although I understand it doesn’t work for everyone. Have also been taking Baclofen with it and planning to stay on both for a year.	9	December 28, 2017	61
Acamprosate	Campral (acamprosate)	I've been a heavy drinker for 10+ years and finally decided to quit with the help of Campral.  I am 45 days sober and Campral has stopped all the cravings I used to have.  I have been taking 1 pill 3 times a day and that has been working well.	9	December 20, 2017	25
Acamprosate		From my mid 20’s until I was 51 I was a fully functioning binge drinker - 1 bottle of wine every night. The only time I was sober was when I was pregnant with my beautiful daughter and for 1 year after she was born. I eventually got to the stage where I was drinking 2 bottles of wine per night and completely blacking out. I went into hospital for a Librium detox in June 2012. When I left hosp I was prescribed Campral 333 x 2 three times daily. Five and a half years later I am still completely sober and have never looked back. I was on Campral for 1 year - fantastic drug. Please ask your Dr to prescribe you with it - it changed my life. Good luck.	10	December 17, 2017	8
Acamprosate		Went Cold Turkey off this drug almost killed me.  I had serious shakes, chills, muscle spasms, body felt limp hallucinations crazy feeling scary nightmares	1	December 8, 2017	0
Acamprosate	Campral (acamprosate)	I was a very heavy drinker from 6am til lights out everyday, week, month, year for the last 10 years. I had never driven my cars at night because I was always drunk. I drank approximately 7,300 beers last year alone (20 a day) I wanted to get off the merry go round so I went to my local doctor and told him my plans and fears. He prescribed Campral, The instructions were NOT to consume alcohol while taking the medicine. Well I was drunk so on the Sat night I took the first 3 pills. The next morning I woke up and thought about having a beer after coffee but seemed okay not having one. That was 2 weeks ago and I still have not had a beer. Brilliant medicine. I quit smoking 2 days later. Campral seems to help with that as well.		December 8, 2017	40
Acamprosate	Campral (acamprosate)	I’m a 43 year old guy living in the uk. I’ve been a regular big drinker since the age of 24.  Always liked the buzz I got off drinking, always drank till I was totally out of it.  Done drink driving four times, the last time I should have been banged up but somehow got away with it, bolloxed up a few relationships along the way through it. In the early years it was fun but it’s destroyed and damaged the last 10 years of my life. Currently in a relationship with someone I love very much and respect a great deal, I’m doing this for both of us. My GP wouldn’t prescribe so going through a referred clinic to get campral after hearing all these uplifting sucess stories from people. Hope it works for me as it did for you. Getting it this Friday	10	November 9, 2017	23
Acamprosate	Campral (acamprosate)	Apart from a few years where I switched to speed I've been a binge drinker for over 20 years. Recently the binges have been more frequent and lasting longer. After the truly awful withdrawal  symptoms subsided I'd last a few days at most before beer started calling my name again. As the saying goes I got sick and tired of being sick and tired. I discovered campral by accident and it's as close to a miracle as you can get. I'm amazed. That voice inside my head is finally silent!	10	November 5, 2017	38
Acamprosate	Campral (acamprosate)	I'd been drinking for years and it got very heavy on the last two years and worse so in the last 6 months.   I failed with antabuse and doctor switched me just this week to this drug. It's been amazing. I went for a few social beers which were planned but I couldn't be bothered with drinking. I would normally have drank until I blacked out but I barely had any urge to drink anything. I had beers in the fridge and normally I would have drank them also after getting home, I woke up they were untouched and I just poured them down the sink.   It works!!	9	October 28, 2017	37
Acamprosate	Campral (acamprosate)	"At the end, I was drinking a fifth of vodka daily, sometimes more.  Was pretty excited about the Sinclair Method using Naltrexone, but it didn't work for me as it did for others.  Two trips to the psych ed with debilitating depression fuelled by alcohol, one inpatient stint and one rehab later, my psychiatrist prescribed Campral.  I'm two weeks in and the worst ""craving"" was thinking about drinking prior to the holiday weekend.  I used my other supports and didn't drink.  I also take gabapentin 600mg three times daily and Zoloft 200mg nightly to help with anxiety and depression.    (This rating would be a 10, but I've had diarrhea for a few days after upping my dose to 666mg 3x/day.)"	9	September 3, 2017	31
Acamprosate	Campral (acamprosate)	I have been taking this for 3 weeks now following a librium detox, I was drinking 3 to 4 bottles of red wine each day, sometimes more. Since taking Campral 3 times a day I haven't had a drink, nor have I wanted to. I  have been out socially with others and had diet Pepsi, people have commented on how well I look, even those who didn't know that I was undertaking detox and I have lost 9 pounds in weight, this is an amazing drug, I was drinking throughout the night and day pretty continuously and I haven't craved a drop.	10	August 24, 2017	67
Acamprosate		I have been on acamprosate for a few days to prevent a relapse. I don't get cravings, but after being on this, I don't get cravings for anything. I have lost all interest in everything and have no motivation. I am tired, nauseous and dizzy and have no desire to do absolutely anything. Please tell me this goes away.	5	August 18, 2017	6
Acamprosate		I lost everything after 35 years hard drinking.Went to rehabs and AA. I  don't want to tell everyone I'm an alcoholic every day when I try to put things past tense. 3 days on campral and yep its gold. sober 4 months and hey a bit of diarrhea  ; but at least I can remember pooping myself. Lets do it. Shane	8	August 17, 2017	21
Acamprosate	Campral (acamprosate)	All be honest I took this and nothing maybe it's all the other meds I take but took this for alcohol and drank alcohol while on it And nothing felt no reduced cravings		July 29, 2017	11
Acamprosate	Campral (acamprosate)	I am just checking in again.  I started campral and naltrexone last fall after drinking for years, failing the traditional in-patient treatment/AA way...... I am now nearly 10 months without a drink.  I don't really crave alcohol.  Occasionally a stressful situation will come up and I will think about drinking, but that passes quickly because I just don't have the cravings or desire.  My life is so fulfilling.  It's not without it's challenges, which is why I have regular counselling in order to recognize and deal with what issues I let alcohol take care of.  I truly do wake up thankful for this relief.	10	July 15, 2017	63
Acamprosate	Campral (acamprosate)	I've been on this before and it works.  The thing is if you take this for a week, then you slip in a drink...you will not feel that intoxication that you crave and are addicted to. This drug also keeps a person from feeling the euphoria associated with opioids.		July 11, 2017	35
Acamprosate	Campral (acamprosate)	"I was immediately put on the suggested  333mg x2 tabs-three times a day ..as soon as I started my community Detox; which included Librium. It is early days here BUT the change in me is enormous. I drank since 20...a ""binge drinker"" or so I thought!!. I was unable to Stop. I'm Lucky to be alive . Once a car I was in went over a precipice but still I craved the alcohol.  The craving was pure hell. Now at 56-I feel finally freed out a prison of craving something that would have killed me . THANK YOU CAMPRAL. People In AA had given up on me and I'd given up too...till Campral. "	9	June 24, 2017	81
Acamprosate	Campral (acamprosate)	Absolutely amazing I am 60 and been a heavy drinker all my life At least one to one and a half  bottles of wine per nite Two or three bottles per day on a weekend plus beer or anything else if I was out After I started taking this I noticed the difference the very next day Within a few days I was having alcohol free days  Within 3 weeks I was going for a week or more without a drink but started drinking a lot of mineral water At 6  weeks I was not even thinking about alcohol After 4 mths I stopped the tablets At six mths I have no craving at all If I am out with friends I will have a red wine occasionally and stop ( could not do this previously )might have a red once every 10 days or so but am completely in control I am still absolutely astounded how well they worked for me	10	June 7, 2017	83

Acamprosate	Campral (acamprosate)	My partner has been a heavy drinker for over 5 years now, and within the last 12 months it officially began to get out of control, leading him into the hospital 3 times for an acute attack of pancreatitis. It got to the point where I was going to leave him cause he just wouldn't stop. He also lost his license from drink driving and almost went to jail because of it. It got up to him drinking 700ml-1lt of scotch every day AND going out on top of it before he decided he wanted help. At first he promised me he could ween himself off on his own (don't they all), and obviously he wasn't successful. So his doctor put him on Campral. It has been 9 days now and he has had 1 beer with dinner. He says he just doesn't have the desire to drink anymore.	8	May 25, 2017	64
Acamprosate	Campral (acamprosate)	"My Dr prescribed this medication at my request and it has helped me considerably. I used to drink every day around that ""happy hour"" time. I would drink hard alcohol of my choice for that week. I drank about 6-8 shot per night.  I have been on Campral a week shy of two months. I have drank on two occasions but did not have the urge to drink it was a matter of just wanting a drink and seeing how Campral will work after the fact. I did not feel the urge to keep drinking the days after I drank on these two occasions. This medication works wonders for me and my family. They have me back. I recommend you try it out. I feel no side affects taking Campral. I can't even tell I have added this medication to my daily meds.  Kim"	10	May 9, 2017	75
Acamprosate	Campral (acamprosate)	I've been relapsing since I started drinking 10 years ago. I tried Campral, but didn't bother to take it as prescribed, often forgetting. After my 3rd rehab, and years of AA and counselling, this has been the most amazing medication I've ever taken. I had zero hope it would work, given it didn't before (again, even tho I forgot to take it sometimes), but it has been a miracle. I mean a miracle. I can walk through the grocery store, see the liquor area, and not be have any desire to drink. I have a three particular triggers I cannot avoid, and have always relapsed due to them. However, I no longer feel the desire to drink now when experiencing them. I go to counselling and DBT, but nothing worked before. Do yourself a favor and try it.	10	May 4, 2017	74
Acamprosate	Campral (acamprosate)	I've been a binge drinker on and off for several years. 	10	April 27, 2017	6
Acamprosate	Campral (acamprosate)	Only 1 week on this 1 pill 3 times a day. I haven't drank anything, but I haven't been in any situations that I would drink yet. I'm a binge drinker. At home I don't drink at all. If I'm out at a casino or bowling I'll go nuts and forget what happens the next day.	5	April 9, 2017	16
Acamprosate		"Hello, I have been a ""functioning alcoholic"" for 20 years.   Drinking a bottle of wine a day.   I have tried Naltrexone twice but each time was unable to tolerate the side effects of nausea and dizziness and did not continue treatment.   For the times I was able to take Naltrexone, it did not curb my consumption and I easily drank right through it.     Presently, I am trying Campral but also find it ineffective for cravings - even though I take the recommended dosage of 333mg x 2, three times daily.   I have been taking for some time now and still experience the same level of cravings.   I do not experience any side effects from this medication nor an accelerated hangovers."	1	April 6, 2017	4
Acamprosate	Campral (acamprosate)	I tried and tried the AA way and it just didn't work. I was told over and over to attempt treatment and I did, four times.  Treatment is extremely overrated.  I finally took it upon myself to investigate other options and discovered acamprosate and naltrexone.  I am now 5 months without drinking and am so, so happy.  I have regular counselling and discovered that AA cannot address the underlying reasons why a person drinks...in my case, PTSD.  AA made me feel like a huge failure.  I am aggravated that over a one year period no one even thought to offer me the option to take these meds.  I am on a mission now to share my successful experience with these drugs with others.	10	February 21, 2017	156
Acamprosate	Campral (acamprosate)	Campral worked as prescribed for me, it gives me relief from the cravings, I didn't feel it was working until I realised that for the first time in years I had reached two weeks with out a drink, the habitual side of drinking is powerful and every time I was triggered it felt on par with a craving. My advice, keep with the Campral even if you feel its not working, give it time, let it do its thing, it will alleviate the cravings which will give you some breathing space to work on the habit itself, my synopsis, Campral will help with half the battle the rest needs counselling, will power and time. Side effects minimal for me, Campral is an excellent tool to stay on the road to recovery, one in my opinion not recommended enough.	9	February 18, 2017	101
Acb		"I've had plenty of CTs with IV contrast before, but not oral contrast, so I decided to look up what to expect.  Mistake.  The internet hyped this up as being sludgy cement that tastes awful, and that I should expect to immediately fight the urge to vomit or soil myself. I had the Vanilla Silq flavor/brand, cold, and it was almost indistinguishable from a vanilla Ensure, save for the knowledge it was mildly radioactive but unlikely to grant superpowers.  Everyone reacts differently, but most people who had their expectations met at Chili's don't post reviews about it, so you won't find a lot of ""everything went fine and normal and I'm going about my day"" posts about barium sulfate. You'll see the nasty and unfortunate stuff though.  Anyway, worst milkshake I've ever had but had no real fallout from it - no nausea or diarrhea, but time will tell about constipation - and would recommend drinking this as infrequently as your doctor will let you."	8	December 9, 2020	6
Acb		I had my CT scan today, I had to drink the barium sulphate...  I’ve had constant diarrhoea for 7 hours now. My stomach sounds like there’s a thunderstorm inside.		September 3, 2020	11
Acb		Tasted sweet, not too bad. Had a couple bouts of diarrhea but nothing severe and resolved within a day!	8	August 26, 2020	2
Acb		I had to drink one bottle of the Berry smoothie wasn't as bad as what my coworkers told me it would taste like. Had a hard time getting it down because it made me feel full very quickly. Almost made me vomit. The rest of the day went ok other than a major headache. The next day I couldn't stop going to the bathroom, but the nurse did say if I hadn't had a bowel movement in 48 hours to call my GP, needless to say I haven't had to call her.	8	August 25, 2020	3
Acb		This poison gave me non stop diarrhea for 12 Damn days. I couldn;t leave my house. They need to put a big WARNING this JUNK. It caused severe bowel inflammation and non stop trips to the bathroom, many hardly in time. It's awful. 12 days living in a nightmare . No warning given to me. No warning on the container it came in., WHY NOT?	1	December 26, 2019	15
Acb		I had the oral and IV contrast and was told I could go to work after the CT scan. I asked about side effects but was told about the major ones not the vomiting and diarrhea. I went to work and got very sick. It was so embarrassing. I had to rush home and almost kicked my house door down getting to the bathroom. The nausea, diarrhea, weakness, tingling in my body was so scary. I was in the bathroom every 5 minutes. That was on Tuesday now here it is Thursday and I am still nausea and can taste the medication in my mouth. My stomach still bubbles up when I eat anything. This is a weight loss plan I didn't sign up for. This experience made me feel worse than what I originally went in for. Never again will I do something like that without doing my research first.	2	September 19, 2019	16
Acb		The taste of barium sulfate was unpleasant but bearable. The following day I was so constipated that my husband considered calling 911. It felt like a metal pipe rupturing my anus. My husband had to administer mineral oil enema up my rectum in order to relieve myself. I am a newlywed—how humiliating 	5	August 14, 2019	9
Acb		Horrible taste. The flavor of artificial sweeteners was overwhelming. I can't tolerate artificial sweeteners. A couple of hours after drinking I had explosive diarrhea. It was terrible my stomach was cramping and I barely made it to the bathroom on several occasions. I won't drink it again.	4	July 31, 2019	9
Acb		No no no no! So I guess I got the orange flavor. And this was the worst thing I’ve ever had to drink in my life. The flavor wasn’t bad. But the consistency was horrible. Just too thick for me to take at once. I sat there with my Powerade and crackers trying to get it down. I spit it out twice because I was on the verge of throwing up. I’m not a dramatic person by any means, but I wish there was an easier way to prep for a CT. I get to take another bottle in the morning. Not looking forward to it	1	March 7, 2019	8
Acb		Had no issues at all drinking readi cat 2.  I read reviews it which  had me worried but no side effects - nothing, so no worries. I hope my post helps	10	January 22, 2019	28
Acb		Drank 2 bottles, one last night and one this morning an hour before a CT of my chest, abdomen, and pelvis.  Vanilla flavor wasn't awful and I didn't have any bad reaction other than some gas, feelings of constipation, and tiredness.  Was instructed to drink plenty of water to flush it all out of my system.  Drank it chilled and that seemed to help with the taste.  Still had iodine through an IV too so hopefully the imaging will accurate and clear.	8	December 1, 2018	16
Acb		I made it threw the first bottle pretty good. The taste wasnt bad at all (had the berry flavor)  but the consistency is just gross. About 10 min later had a huge hit of diarrhea. After half of the second bottle i must have looked white like a ghost as everybody asked me if i was okay and i felt super sick to my stomach. It was hard to keep it down. After the scan i threw up about 8 times and had diarrhea ALL day long. Couldnt drive myself home, husband had to pick me up. I felt so weak. Also having a lot of gas and a huge headache. I am sure its needed but i hope i never have to do this again.	5	September 8, 2018	12
Acb	Readi-Cat 2 (barium sulfate)	Here I lay Thursday having drunk two bottles of Ready-CAT2 oral (1 Sunday and 1 early Monday morning).  I think I am having a reaction to the READY-CAT2 .After drinking one bottle, I felt very full, somewhat nauseous and just rather bad. (Achy joints, intestinal tightness). I called the imaging place the next morning (Monday) and was told to drink the 2nd bottle anyway. I have been having problems with IBS -C and here it is Wednesday 2 am. I was so dizzy and sweaty during the night and now I am dizzy and shaky too. I have not managed to get the READY-CAT Smoothie out of my system and it feels like I swallowed concrete.  I will call both  PCP, GI and Imaging place when they open. My suggestion to others might be to discuss taking READY-CAT Smoothie with the doctor for guidance before taking it, especially if you are already constipated. The vanilla smoothie tastes good but has sorbitol in it. I am obviously sensitive to something in this and know sorbitol is probably one.	5	August 9, 2018	12
Acb	Readi-Cat (barium sulfate)	"Had this for a abdominal CT. Was like a orange creamsickle,  but by no means ""good"" just better than expected. No heartburn, or cramps thus so far, 9 hrs past taking it.  I do have a metallic taste in mouth, but not sure if it's the readicat, or iodine I had as an injected contrast as well. May just be nerves.   In all, it was not bad."	10	May 5, 2018	12
Acb		I took the Vanilla Flavored and it wasn’t as bad as I thought it would be. Drank one bottle 3 hours prior to the scan, another 1/2 bottle an hour before the scan, a 1/2 bottle 30 minutes prior to the scan and another cup immediately prior to the scan. I had been expecting diarrhea, and was surprised to find it made me constipated. I kept drinking water, however, and finally went about 3-4 hours later. If it all helps to find out the problem, it’s definitely worth it!	10	January 16, 2018	10
Acb	Readi-Cat (barium sulfate)	I had the banana flavor and it was a BIG improvement from the old days of just drinking chalk!  However, it was thick and at times unpleasant.  I had to gag down 2 large servings, plus they administered an iodine IV during the CT scan.  About 45 minutes after the procedure, it all hit and I was in the bathroom for the next several hours.  Not sure if it was the barium or iodine, but this was one of the common side effects and worth it to find out what's going on inside me or for prevention!	8	January 13, 2018	13
Acb		Didn't taste bad at all. You just have to take it!. Did give me diarrhea though.	10	November 2, 2017	6
Acb	Readi-Cat (barium sulfate)	Orange flavor wasn't bad but a little orange food coloring might have made the illusion a bit more convincing.  Medium thick but went down without much problem. Technician assured me it was light years better than the chalky mix they used to use.  Then got an injection of an unnamed diuretic and urination every 5 minutes began. Not sure if it was completely the diuretic or the barium was a contributor but it continued right up to PET time. I warned them so they procured a plastic urinal and wrapped an diaper around me on the table. Neither got used during the 15 minute scan but it took a lot of clenched sphincter action to prevent a mess. Ten seconds off the table the urinal got used.	7	October 8, 2017	9
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Obsessive Compulsive Disorder	Clonazepam works brilliantly for my OCD and PTSD both of which cause me insomnia.  Before Clonazepam, my thoughts wouldn't stop.  With it I can relax and sleep.  My dosage is .5mg.  I usually take Lunesta as well to help me shut the lights out in my mind.	10	April 20, 2021	0
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Insomnia	Been on klonopin/5 years 1 mg night and not really feeling it. Mostly was for insomnia. It’s hard to tapper off. My doc said don’t, sorry just take won’t hurt you????I want to get off but my mind tells me stay on it. I take before bed. Having bad thoughts rebound insomnia. I need talk someone that knows how to taper	6	April 20, 2021	1
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	I just read a review from TexMex.  I was so happy to see that someone else is taking a super low dose (.125mg). I take this dose once or twice a week. Sometimes I can go a week or two without taking any.  I started keeping a journal to look for triggers.  I finally discovered situations that would trigger an attack (sometimes, not always). I have started taking .125 mg before going into these situations and 90% of my anxiety is gone.  I feel somewhat normal again.  For those of you complaining about feeling sleepy, try taking a little less than what is prescribed.  It might not work for you, but with this drug less is better. Good Luck and Thanks TexMex!!	10	April 19, 2021	3
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	For panic attacks and general anxiety, this drug is awesome!  I have kept this drug in my home for about 15 years.  I go months without it.  However, when anxiety hits, I can take .5mg and I get relief within 20-30 min.  I have taken 1 mg at night to sleep during these times.  I might take this drug several days in a row.  Then I can go long periods of time without it again.  It is a life saver for me.	10	April 19, 2021	5
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Migraine Prevention	I take this medication for anxiety, and have never found that it prevents migraine at all. It will sometimes listen the symptoms if I take it at the very onset of a migraine, but not preventative in my experience.	4	April 19, 2021	0
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	Mild to moderate anxiety attacks. My doctor prescribed 0.25 mg as needed. If I take one it calms me down but I’m sleepy. I have been taking 0.125 mg 2-3 days a week. It’s all I need to take the edge off. Twice my anxiety has been bad enough to take an extra .125 mg a few hours after the first dose. I have never taken more than that.	10	April 17, 2021	5
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	My doctor gave me a prescription one year ago for anxiety.  It says to take .25-.5 mg daily as needed.  I am scared to get hooked on this drug.  I didn't take it for a long time.  Then one day I had bad stress and anxiety.  I finally took .25 mg. It worked but it made me very sleepy.  I don't want something that knocks me out! I just want to feel normal.  The next time I was feeling anxiety/stress, I took .125 mg. (1/4 of a .5mg tablet) This was perfect for me.  It didn't make be sleepy, but I felt calm after an hour of taking it.  I am a petite woman so maybe a smaller dose is all I need.  I can always take another .125 mg if I need to. I'm still afraid of the drug, but as long as I don't take it every day it might be ok.  My doctor says if I can get by on such a tiny dose I will be fine.	10	April 15, 2021	5
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Klonopin (clonazepam) for Panic Disorder	This is the best medicine for anxiety by far. My psychiatrist put me on this drug yesterday and thirty minutes after taking it I was so calm, I was shocked. I have tried everything that was not in the benzodiazepine family and nothing worked. My Doctor suggested I go on and I am thrilled. I haven't felt this good in a long time (calm). I am on .5 x 2 a day I am happy and it feels so good. I suffer from PTSD, anxiety and depression. I also take Latuda 40mg for now. I will let you know if anything changes.	10	April 15, 2021	8
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Burning Mouth Syndrome	I have suffered with Burning Mouth Syndrome (BMS) for almost a year.  Tried everything.  Nothing helped.  Took several months to convince my MD and DDS that it was not fungal related.  Stumbled on this article and asked my MD if I could try clonazepam and she agreed.  I take 1/4 mg every 4 hrs by allowing to dissolve and holding in my mouth and then swallowing.   Relief is truly incredible.  Went from a 9 or 10 on bad days to a 1 or 2.   Has it cured my BMS?  No.  Does it make it tolerable? Yes. So glad I found this web page.	9	April 9, 2021	2
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Insomnia	Was prescribed this by my new doctor who refused to let me continue with the medication I have been taking for 2 years and actually works well for me.  Took this at 7:30 PM and am still wide awake at 4:00 AM.  Tried to sleep, but wide awake.  Time to go back to the old doctor.	1	April 5, 2021	4
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Insomnia	I take 10mg melotonin+clonazepam I eventually fall to sleep but only for two hours, toss and turn for another eight hours	2	March 30, 2021	1
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Restless Legs Syndrome	I was put on Clonazepam 22 years ago for Restless Legs Syndrome. I thought this was a miracle drug, until my dr said she had to take me off of Clonzapam. That is where  my NIGHTMARE began. I have been off of it for 3 months now and I cannot function at all!! This drug destroyed my nervous system. You don’t realize that until you are off of it. Tinnitus is unbearable. I cannot even talk right now because my voice is too loud. I am constantly shaking. I have so much pain in my ears. There is constant pressure in my head. I could go on and on with the horrible symptoms I am suffering. This is the most painful thing I have ever been through.. This drug is not suppose to be given unless you are only on it for just a few days.  It may take months or years for me to heal. I am telling my story to even stop one person from going on this medication. You do not realize that this medication will destroy you  - until go off of it.. THIS MEDICATION WILL DESTROY YOUR LIFE	1	March 27, 2021	2
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	I am a middle aged guy who suffers from panic attacks. I was put on .0.5 mg of klonopin and l must say this is a miracle drug. I couldn't be more happier.	9	March 23, 2021	6
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	I never took an aspirin until 3 years ago when not only did I suffer trauma and the ensuing PTSD at the ripe old age of 60, but I also was diagnosed with an incurable, chronic autoimmune disease.  I am now 63 and after having tried multiple SSRI's, which do nothing, I was prescribed clonazapam.  I take 1 mg once a day.  I was warned about all the side effects....dependency, tolerance, etc and quite frankly, I do not care. If this drug keeps me alive and calms my thoughts, and makes me want to live.  My dr is in full agreement with taking this for the rest of my days.  Quality of life versus quantity....I have no intention of coming off of it...therefore withdrawal will not be an issue.	10	March 22, 2021	28
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Benzodiazepine Withdrawal	I hope I can keep someone from going through this nightmare that I'm going through. Was on 3 mg daily for a year, over time I grew dependent, and they stopped helping and causing worse anxiety and panic attacks upon awaking. I didn't wean off properly and am in acute withdrawal, I'm  suicidal, and my life is falling apart. Please stay away from this awful drug. IT WILL RUIN YOUR LIFE!	5	March 22, 2021	17
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	This med provides instant relief for my anxiety and negative thoughts.  I only take 2 mg every other day but of course my doctor wants me off of it because it causes dependency and dementia.  Well there are a lot of meds including over the counter sleep aids that have been linked to dementia and aren't controlled substances.  Have taken antidepressants in the past for anxiety and currently trying another that has yet to kick in.  They either don't work for me or cause awful side effects.  For some people, Benzos are the only thing that keeps them calm.  I can focus, relax, dive into tasks I put off, be social, and it also helps with pain and I can sleep better.  I hope this medication is not outlawed.	10	March 17, 2021	15
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	I got very much relief after taking this medicine	9	March 13, 2021	0
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Insomnia	Very bad experience	1	March 13, 2021	2
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	Trex03 I highly doubt you will see this. I really wish you could reply to people on here. I’ve had my issues with anxiety for a very a long time for generalized to onset panic attacks the list goes on. One of the main reasons I started looking at the reviews was to see if anyone had opinions on different generics unfortunately for me from what I’ve read so far not with this only effects and there overall experience which is good just not what I was looking for. Your post was from so long ago I am sure you figured out something + will never see this but hopefully it helps someone. I found that only manufacturer that works for me with least side effect & doesn’t feel like I am taking 1/2 when taking a full 1 is the manufacture TEVA. It does take a little work looking around to find who carries it depending where you go may special order it usually not big name pharms. Though TEVA’s Klonopin has worked best for me  and even go out of my way to make sure that what I’m getting	8	March 9, 2021	1
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Insomnia	This drug can be life-saving for some, but as everyone else has said, you do NOT want to start taking this medication unless you are REALLY in a bad spot. Dependence builds and then getting off them becomes next to impossible without a super long, slow taper, and even then, your anxiety and sleep will worsen as you get lower and stop, leaving you worse off than when you started. I've been on and off this med for a few years and I find it works for me better if I don't take it daily. I also noticed, over time, that it was actually starting to give me MORE anxiety, even when I'd try and up the dose for a few days in a row to catch up on sleep. Only take this medication with extreme caution. Get on something safer long-term, like an antidepressant. They're a much better way to deal with anxiety since benzos build tolerance and you'll always need more and more to get the same relief. Awful medications. Again, can be life-saving but long term, they are definitely life-threatening.	2	March 1, 2021	6
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Klonopin (clonazepam) for Seizure Prevention	At 12 years old I was diagnosed with epilepsy after grand mal seizures. It took years of being on numerous epilepsy medications throughout the years. I am 47 years old and finally a different neurologist got the right combination of 2 medications that has changed my life in a very positive way. I take Lamictal twice a day (each 200 milligram tablets) The Lamictal alone wasn’t enough for my epileptic condition. My neurologist added the Klonopin 3 times a day 1 milligram tablets) and bingo this is what has kept me seizure free. I wish I never had to take Klonopin as it makes me so tired but I will deal with that verses having a grand mal seizure. It boggles my mind that this is considered a controlled substance as I think who the heck would want this? Who the heck would want to feel tired? Who would actually enjoy taking this if they didn’t have to? Unbelievable. Not fun at all by any means. My neurologist adding the Klonopin with Lamictal nailed down my epilepsy condition.	10	February 25, 2021	6
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Restless Legs Syndrome	I used clonazepam for my RLS until my doctor suggested low dose (2mg) ropinirole, which is a Parkinson's medication. I have been taking it for close to 20 years. A bit hard on the stomach but I've had no other side effects. I think it's a better choice.	8	February 22, 2021	1
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Insomnia	Great drug!!! Took Xanax for 2 years this is much stronger longer lasting and just a better drug period. I like it because I can take less and it last much longer. Don't understand the hype about xanax after two years taking it Klonopin is the go too far better than xanax in every way	10	February 22, 2021	5
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Restless Legs Syndrome	clonazepam absolutely works for restless legs ..the only medication that has!	10	February 18, 2021	1
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Insomnia	It's great for a stressful night, but the next night will worse, so shelve the urge, and take half. With benzos, like with alcohol, you are way more deranged  and slower than you think, and appear so to others - so consider that in the long run and watch out.	7	February 17, 2021	1
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Burning Mouth Syndrome	"I have had burning mouth syndrome (BMS) for 28 years and I have been to every Dr imaginable.  For over a year, most Dr's thought I was crazy, as they knew nothing about it, until I found an older Dr in dental research. He told me back then about Klonepin. I was so excited, as it did help. Then, I took 1 mg tablet, 3 x's a day. That brought my pain level down to about a 2. For the last 10 years, I have been taking only .5mg 3 x's a day and my BM is getting worse. I have a wonderful Dr & m physical is next month. I'm going to ask her if I can go back to the 3mg daily. I'm 72 and have lived with this so long. I'm glad I found this website, just to know others are suffering with this too. Does anyone use ""liquid Klonepin/Clonazepam""? Just curious, as I've never heard of that."	6	February 16, 2021	3
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Insomnia	So far I have taken only 3 pills in the last month (2mg, unprescribed) and the only side effects I have noticed is dizziness the next morning and maybe mood swings through the week, nothing so bad, but on the other side I sleep like a baby and feel somewhat numb the next day. I take it only when needed, if I'm feeling nervous or when I'm taking a while to sleep. Oh and of course please don't go around taking unprescribed drugs like I did.	10	February 12, 2021	0
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Burning Mouth Syndrome	Been suffering with this Burning Mouth Syndrome BMS issue for over a year now. I’ve been to every doctor possible and no one could find a solution. I have the Clonazepam drops but don’t know the right dosage to help. If anyone has tried the drops please share.	1	February 11, 2021	1
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Night Terrors	I have had instant relief from my intense night terrors (smashing windows, breaking down doors). I have taken 0.25Mg (Half of 0.5Mg) every night before bed. Reduced sleep talking and yelling. I will increase the dosage if I need to. I have no side effects of sleepiness or drowsiness during the day or the night.	10	February 8, 2021	1
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Borderline Personality Disorder	I have BPD, OCD (Pure O(intruisive thoughts)) and dissociation that comes from anxiety. I was tried all sorts of benzos and my opinion is that Klonopin works the best for anxiety and comorbid conditions, it helped me put me in balance and the more I take it (longer period of time) I see improvements of my general mental health because it clears my brain fog caused by anxiety. I am able to think straight and is helping me to put in check symptoms that I can not control my own  I take it for 2 weeks, 0.5-1 mg per day with few days off, for now it works great. Also I use omega 3 and do cognitive exercises just to prevent some cognitive deficits like memory loss because of benzos. Ofc, like all benzos be careful taking it and if you don't need it don't take it, don't use it for experiencing some highs or something, benzos are extremely dangerous if you get hooked up on them, wish you all the best and good health✌	9	February 7, 2021	0
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Bipolar Disorder	I have used klonopin off and on for over 20 years as a PRN for my bipolar disorder. It works extremely well at managing anxiety and panic attacks. It also helps with sleep. I use CBT with my therapist to help manage my routine. If I get off my routine and stop using klonopin I become manic which is detrimental to my life in many ways. I have tried several different meds but none works as well as klonopin for me.	10	February 5, 2021	6
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Burning Mouth Syndrome	Withdrawal from clonazepam was the worst and lasted over 5 years with burning mouth, stinging raw tongue feeling and deep cracks in tongue after stopping. That is if you can get past the first month off of it. After many searches and asking doctors with getting no answer I had given up and accepted this is life now off the meds and I have to live in pain for ever. GOOD NEWS!!! The feeling in my mouth has went away and hasn't returned in over 2 weeks. I believe it was due to me homebrewing a german hefewiezen with large amounts of yeast in suspension while consuming it green or fresh. Too bad there isn't a study on this because I am sure I wasn't the only one to suffer after stopping this medication.	6	February 5, 2021	0
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Klonopin (clonazepam) for Panic Disorder	Klonopin is great for panic, sleep problems & anxiety. Also the worst thing to happen to me since trying to come off of it. I was never suicidal in my life, now I entertain the idea nearly everyday because of what it does to you once you stop taking it. It’s an absolute nightmare - something I wouldn’t wish on anyone, ever.	2	February 5, 2021	19
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Klonopin (clonazepam) for Panic Disorder	I was diagnosed with panic disorder in June and went through a rough period where I developed agoraphobia and thought I was losing my mind. I’ve dealt with depression and anxiety and had tried 7 antidepressants before developing panic disorder. While having panic disorder, I’ve tried four and the only medication that has not had side effects such as increased anxiety and severe stomach issues is Klonopin. Klonopin saved my life and allowed me to get back to being myself. I can now drive, hang out with friends, leave the house, work effectively and I haven’t noticed any side effects besides being a bit tired and occasional hot flashes (which I had already with PD.) It’s been five months now that I’ve been on 1mg and I haven’t had to increase the dose. I beat myself up because I don’t enjoy the stigma that goes along with benzos and am scared to be on this for years to come but after reading some of these reviews, I feel a lot better about having to take it long term.	9	February 4, 2021	28
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Klonopin (clonazepam) for Panic Disorder	Works great, causes short-term memory loss big time yeah	9	February 4, 2021	1
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Insomnia	Clonazapam is the only thing that stops my nighttime anxiety/panic and helps me get the sleep that I need.  I do worry about becoming addicted but it has been a lifesaver for me.  I was taking  .5 every night for a month then down to .25 most nights for two months then tried .125 for a bit.  Haven’t  taken it in 9 days and thought I wouldn’t need it again but had a rough night last night so I’m happy to have it.  .25 tonight should help me get back to sleeping good.	10	February 2, 2021	3
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Klonopin (clonazepam) for Panic Disorder	I am a 26 year old woman who has been struggling with panic disorder & social anxiety. I have been on Klonopin (1mg 3x a day) for about a year. This medication really does help me calm down my nerves. Unlike other benzos I have tried in the past,  it does not make me as tired. Lately it has been making me a bit more drowsy than usual, and I think the only reason I’m feeling that as a side effect is because I’ve been losing weight and I am on other anti depressants. I plan to talk to my doctor about lowering my dose a bit but otherwise this is a great medication to manage my anxiety!	8	February 1, 2021	5
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Panic Disorder	Among all benzodiazepines, clonazepam has the most effect on me.  It got the job done and kept anxiety away from me. The problem is that it currently doesn't seem to be having such an effect (I don't take it chronically, I take it when I have panic attacks). An example of this was an exam that I had to do: I was medicated with 0.75mg of clonazepam (sublingual) and, despite being medicated, the anxiety was so great that clonazepam could not contain it, and I had panic attacks during the exam that I was taking.	8	January 31, 2021	1

Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Klonopin (clonazepam) for Panic Disorder	Back when I was first diagnosed with bipolar disorder I suffered from bad anxiety. Much to my relief I was prescribed Klonopin at 1mg and it really helped. Then I changed doctors. They instantly took me off and put me on inderal which was a huge let down and did not help. Then came ativan and that didn't do a darn thing to me. Now that I have another psychiatrist I'm back on Klonopin I just started back up today and looking forward to less anxiety	8	January 23, 2021	19
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	This medicine is a godsend if you do not have addictive qualities.  I thank God that my tolerance to this drug does NOT increase. I have taken higher doses that would cause non-users severe amnesia (2-4mg) and they actually do not work hardly any better than just a simple .5mg dose. If you are struggling with anxiety I would highly recommend taking this with perhaps celexa, and do not think twice about trying a regimen of 3 times per day. Yes, in the morning it does not cause me drowsiness. Clonazepam saved my life: got rid of rapid mood swings, gave me hope that I could calm down, and no intense withdrawals or cravings. Saved me from having to take antipsychotics for agitation and saved my marriage. The prescription guidelines for this drug are too harsh because of the general drug crisis and short acting Benzos. The prescribing guidelines specifically say that it does help a certain population with daily use, your average doctor simply doesn't want to deal with you. Blessings to all.	9	January 22, 2021	21

Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Insomnia	I have terrible insomnia and over the years have tried everything, but always had terrible side effects. My doctor put me on Klonopin  and I take it only as needed when I have a night I can’t sleep. I get a good, restful night’s sleep and wake up feeling refreshed in the morning. Since it’s an anti-anxiety drug, I wonder if the way my mind races all night long with worry, that this is what it is addressing and helping me sleep?  I don’t take it every night and do not feel addicted in any way.	10	January 15, 2021	14
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Insomnia	My doctor prescribed 0.5MG during a period of stress when I was finding it difficult to sleep or to function in public. It was hard to make decisions and even small problems threatened to put me into a state of panic. With Klonopin, I can sleep through the night and wake up feeling calm and rested. Often, I don't need to take any in the morning unless I am facing a particularly stressful day. After taking it every night for 2 months, I quit cold turkey.  For about three nights I hardly slept at all. It took two weeks to get back to a reasonable state of normal.  No real serious withdrawal symptoms other than being exhausted and anxious from lack of sleep.  Definitely recommend tapering when getting off this drug.  I still use it off and on to help me get through stressful events or to get a good nights sleep.  But I am being very careful not to get hooked. For me this drug has no side effects and has been a life saver.	9	January 13, 2021	9
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	I just began having what feels like some kind of delayed reaction to weaning off of Effexor. Then I was given Clonazepam to control anxiety & agitation and this med has driven my symptoms off the chart. I’ve gone from anxious and agitated to feeling like an enraged destructive moose. I am walking 3 & 4 times a day just to try & calm myself. When I take this med I loose all sense of coordination, not from being dizzy, I just can’t maintain my balance.	1	January 7, 2021	5
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Klonopin (clonazepam) for Panic Disorder	I’ve been taking Klonopin for just over a year now for panic disorder and epilepsy, along with Valium for epilepsy, and temezapam and Ambien for sleep. Klonopin is great for me at preventing panic attacks as I normally get on average 4-5 per week instead of 20 or more before I started it. However, this medication has made me antisocial. I have intermittent explosive disorder now and it makes me aggressive and I have rage attacks. I take 10-12 mg per day. I’m giving the medication a 3 because even though it helps my anxiety and epilepsy, I have become emotionally numb and cannot empathize with others at all.	3	January 3, 2021	4
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	This was the best anti anxiety medication I have ever experienced. I was on it for 20 years. I had zero side effects and it was not habit forming.	10	December 31, 2020	34
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Periodic Limb Movement Disorder	I was prescribed clonazepam for myclonic jerks in legs at night with spasms in my feet and shooting electric shock sensations in my lower legs. I was terrified of taking it having read horror stores about tolerance and addiction.  But, after lack of sleep impacting significantly on my ability to function on a day to day basis, I started to take it. I  take it 2/3 times a week (0.25mg), it calms my legs down and I get some sleep. It works very well for me and I don’t feel I have developed a tolerance that requires me to up my dose or that I am addicted. Fortunately, I teach so take a break from it during holidays and just get what sleep I can knowing I can rest up during the day. Don’t be frightened by negative reports, if you need it, take it. It has been a godsend and knowing that it is there to give me a couple of good nights sleep a week is enough to keep me going during term time.  I suffer no side effects. I am on a low dose so I am not groggy the next morning.	10	December 30, 2020	2
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Benzodiazepine Withdrawal	6 yrs. ago when my husband died suddenly, my PCP gave me an RX for clonazepam (1 mg) at bedtime to help with my anxiety attacks and as a sleep aid.  I had to call her every month for a refill because it is a controlled substance in the U.S. and she warned that I should NOT withdraw quickly.  I recently met and married a Canadian man and moved to his country.  In becoming established with a new MD I learned that they do not like to Rx clonazepam in here.  I had reduced my dose from 1 mg to 1/2 mg and when she asked about my withdrawal symptoms, she felt that I was OK and didn't prescribe more.  I suppose that I am OK but my ears are ringing, my skin is burning, I had blazing headaches and severe muscle pain for the first two weeks that I was off of the 1/2 mg dose; I haven't had a good night's sleep since reducing my dose from 1 mg to 1/2 and now to none at all.  I am anxious have palpitations and generally feel unwell.	10	December 29, 2020	41
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Insomnia	I have been barely sleeping 4 to 4m1/2 hours of sleep every night for over a year. Since I take Clonazepam I sleep little longer and stay asleep at least 6 hours a night.	9	December 29, 2020	11
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Insomnia	I've taken clonazepam since I was 13 (my mom didn't know it was bad since I've always had insomnia), it helped me sleep but waking up was a nightmare, I used to take more than 6+mg and I wasn't even 17. Ask your doctor to help you replace the drug with something better if it's insomnia. Ambien works so much better and so does other benzos that are way new in the pharmaceutical industry.	6	December 25, 2020	8
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	On klonopin/clonozepam 1mg ODT for 4 years for chronic pain. It didn't relax me or anything but compared to many other medicine it took a couple points from my chronic pain in the right side of the face. Not a miracle drug for me but not immediate side-effects compared to others so I kept using it. For ODT specifically I would develop small clear bumps (mouth ulcers) under my tongue and on the insides of the cheeks. They would go away after few days but one stayed there for over a year. I had to do punch biopsy on it. When I tried to lookup if anyone else have such symptoms I couldn't find anything. So I'm posting it here. If you try to switch the location of where the ODT dissolves a couple days later a new clear bump will be there. The drug blocks minor salivary glands which we have a few hundreds all over the mouth. Sometimes it blocks them for good leaving you with permanent bumps that fill up with saliva irritate you and then burst after a few days only to repeat a cycle a few days later. Beware.	1	December 24, 2020	5
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Panic Disorder	I have had Sleep Paralysis, PTSD, Anxiety, Trouble controlling my own thoughts as  I was trying to sleep. This drug saved my life. I wake up refreshed and when I sleep I can control my thoughts.  No more paralysis and I used to have it every single night since I was 12.	10	December 17, 2020	5
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	This medicine is one of the best medicine for anxiety and PTSD. It helps very little for my fibro but so thankful. I can cope with my other medical issues way better. If it would not be for this med I would be dead now.	10	December 14, 2020	41
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Panic Disorder	I am gonna be honest.... Clonazepam is an amazing medication. It has only done good things for me. I was taking it daily for 7 1/2 years, doses ranging from 0.5mg to 3mg a day. At the beginning of 2020, right at the start of the pandemic, I stopped taking it because of how hard it was to get access to it. So I just decided to just taper down and quit. I tapered for about a week, very fast, and I know this part is going to be unbelievable. But I had no withdrawal symptoms at all. Literally nothing. I just stopped taking it and I felt okay. Nowadays I still take it as needed, maybe once a month or every two months. All in all I don't regret taking clonazepam, it gave me my life back after being agoraphobic. And after reading horror stories about the withdrawal for years I feel like a fool because I had no symptoms. You might be the same. Clonazepam is just a good medicine.	10	December 12, 2020	14
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Klonopin (clonazepam) for Panic Disorder	Hi to everyone, I've been taking Klonopin about four years I take it until now and it’s excellent. Per night I take 1mg for sleep just  It’s very good and safe. Good luck	10	December 11, 2020	17
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	Klonopin works great for my anxiety and OCD, it's better then any prescription out there including SSRI,I just don't understand why they don't give this too people with anxiety	10	December 8, 2020	35
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Insomnia	Great for sleep- Never use for more than a week. Hard to stop using after no longer needed.	7	December 8, 2020	10
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Benzodiazepine Withdrawal	I've finally come off clonazepam after taking it for 10 years. I started on CBD oil . I weened off slowly and am sleeping like a baby.  Good luck all.		November 30, 2020	53
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Benzodiazepine Withdrawal	I was on clonazepam for 12 years - .5 twice daily with the larger dose at night to help me sleep.  I never increased my dose.  It allowed me to have a life, a business and a relationship and be normal again.  I am now in late 50's and our country has decided this medication can't be taken long term so I weaned myself off them. It was horrible and I miss the feeling of being relaxed. So far nothing else has worked for my anxiety  snd now it is a struggle every day.  Clonazepam was a lifesaver for me and although I feel much brighter mentally off it, I struggle so much with physical exhaustion, lack of sleep and other issues.  The side effects feel like they were worth it for my quality of life but I am unable to access this medication.  As I slide into my 60's I feel like this should not be a time I have to relearn how to be a normal human again... :(  I lose 20-30 hours per week of unproductive time, I have  high blood pressure, horrible insomnia, pulled muscles in my body from stress....	10	November 17, 2020	52
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Migraine Prevention	clonazepam help is huge, it helps me sleep, helps migraine, PTSD,  anxiety.  I heard the symptoms after going off are really bad but every medication has that! This pill saved me.	10	November 15, 2020	6
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Klonopin (clonazepam) for Epilepsy	If you are having trouble withdrawing from this drug, declare war with yourself and exercise like you have never exercised before. With an understanding of what the drug does to the brain, you have to fight for it back.   Yes, it's hard the hardest painful workout I ever did.  I went against doctors' advice, and the doctor told me to keep doing it on the next visit.  And make this part of your life till the day you are no longer on this earth.  Keep fighting the war against addiction.  I wouldn't wish benzos use on my worst enemy.  Good luck.		November 13, 2020	14
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Insomnia	Diagnosed with depression and generalized anxiety 2 years ago. Antidepressant helped with the depression immensely, but the anxiety still tended to come out at night.  Heard too many horror stories about Ambien and wanted to avoid benzos for the same reason.  Tried hydroxyzine for a month.  No results.  Trazadone didn't do much and left me feeling hungover in the morning.  Finally agreed to a low dose (.25 mg) clonzepam and it worked wonders.  Fall asleep fast, stay asleep all night, and don't feel drugged up in the morning.  Knowing I have something that works has helped ease the anxiety that came with the fear of being up all night.  It's been about 5 months and now I don't need to take it often - I'm due for a refill tomorrow and 3/4 of my script is still there. But on those nights I feel the racing anxiety it's been a nice security blanket to have on hand. I don't feel the urge to abuse this stuff, I don't get any euphoria or high, I just get sleep and the ability to wake up functioning.	10	November 9, 2020	55
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Burning Mouth Syndrome	Once I found this site, I was willing to try anything as dealing with this issue and no one was helping as they never heard of it, I went to  dentist, allergist, and dermatologist.  Lucky for me I had both of the top 2 medications recommended.  I started taking them both at 9am, 2pm and 11pm within 2 day my pain was 75% better, and 1 week later it was 90% better.  I just hope this continues to help		November 6, 2020	9
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Klonopin (clonazepam) for Panic Disorder	Story summarized: Believe the horror stories. They are true. I started taking it as a 30 day supply for anxiety and insomnia, it helped me so much I wanted more after the 30 days. Doctor wouldn’t do it, so I moved on.  Didn’t take it for months back to the old sleepless, anxious, angry person.  Got the script, it helps every single day of my life. Newsflash. Good luck stopping. Same withdrawal as heroin.  I will just take the pill and feel good and normal.  8 stars because it did pull me out of death spiral but lost 2 because nobody on earth deserves to take this nasty ass pill. Confusing yup. It does help with a lot of different things.... but good luck leaving!! :/	8	November 3, 2020	34
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Insomnia	Took Klonopin to try to help with my insomnia. Took for a month. Not sure what dose etc, this was a year ago. It put me in a really dark place. I had to come off of it.	1	October 31, 2020	6
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Benzodiazepine Withdrawal	I have been off and on this medication clonazepam multiple times, no withdrawals so far. I have multiple if not close to all anxiety disorders, I've also been on multiple SSRI's, SNRI's, a-typical anti-psychotics and hypnotics. I have been on Ativan 2mg 3 times daily, Valium I cant remember the amount. Now I rely on 1mg Clonazepam before bed while I search for the appropriate medication that will help me in the long term (prozac now). I might have to go through withdrawals, but truly if this medication leaves you worse off then when you started it, it probably wasn't for you. For some people this is a godsend when you cant live or even remember where you are in the moment, for others its a nightmare. Everyone is different, don't let the comments scare you. Find a Doc/Psych that will understand you the best they can. Don't ever give up and search for the solution that suites you best. Good luck.	9	October 25, 2020	25
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	Been taking clonazepam for a decade. 2mg per day, was at 6mg per day max a few years back. Helps tremendously. Tolerance for me doesn’t increase like other Benzos like Ativan and Xanax does. Negative side effects are very few other than maybe dry mouth.	10	October 18, 2020	43
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Klonopin (clonazepam) for Panic Disorder	I am a nurse and was so anti- psych based medication until COVID hit. I lost my job due to not being able to work an odd shift. I started having panic, anxiety, and paranoia. I have a huge phobia with medication that it will cause every side effect. I finally was brave enough to try 0.25 mg .  This medication has changed my life for the good thus far. At one point I could not drive/ function due to panic and this has made things much easier.	9	October 14, 2020	81
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Panic Disorder	When panic and anxiety have taken over your entire life. To where you basically don't even have one.  Clonazepam can be very helpful.  This along with therapy and having honest conversations with your psychiatrist.  Its disheartening to see so many people bashing it because you can become dependent on it.  If your dependent its probably because its doing what its supposed to. The same way I'm dependent on my BP meds.  I need those also.  Don't misuse any drug and take it as you are prescribed.  If you can't do that. Then don't even start. It works well for me and has given me a much better quality of life. I've been on 1mg for two years and I have no plans of ever stopping.  There is no need to live your life in fear.  Therapy is also a great addition.  There is light at the end of the tunnel.  Don't be afraid to get help.		October 3, 2020	35
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Benzodiazepine Withdrawal	Withdrawing from this drug has been the worst experience of my life.  On 0.5mg twice a day for five years, I wasn't told by my doctor that it is addictive and not for long term use.  I told the doctor l wanted to stop taking it and he advised me to wean myself off it.  After 3 months of reducing it l stopped completely and during the weaning process never experienced any withdrawal symptoms.   Within a week they started, dizzy, ringing in my ears, tremors, terrible headaches, nausea, lack of appetite and weight loss.  Every time l feel a little better all of the symptoms come back.  I am told that this  can go on for months.  My advice, don't start on this drug.	1	October 2, 2020	76
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Benzodiazepine Withdrawal	I’ve been taking 2 clonazapam for a month I want to get off I have 22 left I want to cut down and off wondering how to do this safe I can’t go into a facility	2	September 30, 2020	7
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Benzodiazepine Withdrawal	I've been on klonopin for a long time probably five years. Not a big dose just 0.5 three times a day then twice a day.  Then my husband left me and my world fell apart panic attacks so bad I couldn't leave the house. Now back on klonopin and pain meds for back probs.  Then Dr would not refill the klonopin till today so sick as I had to wait three hours till pharmacy opens I'm old -70 plus years - I can't take this pain sweating suffering can't eat or sleep. It is not worth it.... beware of these drugs	10	September 30, 2020	29
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)		I suffer from severe PTSD from domestic violence. This clonazepam medication has helped me tremendously be able to live with constant panic without this treatment closely monitored by my psychiatrist I would not be able to with out panic and fear.	10	September 26, 2020	7
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Benzodiazepine Withdrawal	If I could rate it as a “0” I would..  You shouldn’t be on this drug for more than a couple of weeks..  Clonazepam is a nightmare. I’m a month or so in on the withdrawals and the only thing keeping me alive is my faith in God and my loved ones. It’s hard to eat, it’s hard to sleep, it’s hard to take care of myself. I would never wish this pain on anyone. Please do NOT take this drug for more than a couple of weeks. I know you feel like you should listen to your doctor over some random anon on the internet but PLS listen. If I can warn people so they don’t have to face the same mental anguish and pain I’m in right now I will. This is the hardest thing I’ve been through in my entire life. Be wary of ANY drug that’s a benzo. They’re awful, habit forming and change your judgment and decision making.. Stay away from this drug.. and if your doc keeps pushing you to take it get a new doctor.	1	September 25, 2020	57
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Burning Mouth Syndrome	I’ve had burning mouth syndrome now for over a year. I’d had other weird mouth symptoms just prior to getting it  that I’d attributed to my steroid inhalers. One day I cooked an egg in a new saucepan - and my mouth suddenly went numb and  I had  an intense burning sensation.  An oral surgeon  diagnosed burning mouth syndrome (but he didn’t know what caused  my other mouth symptoms) . He told me to gargle  Paxam 2 (Clonazepam 2mg) twice a day to settle down the nerves in my face. I have found that the medication has been a great relief to me..  The added bonus is that it helps me sleep! An interesting thing I discovered about a possible cause of burning mouth syndrome  could be an ingredient in some toothpastes, mouthwashes and  gums. Some people are allergic to an ingredient in them - a fake cinnamon (cinnamaldehyde) that can cause mouth sores, burning etc.	8	September 17, 2020	9
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Benzodiazepine Withdrawal	I been on 4mg dose of clonazepam per day for a month for benzo withdrawal. I've had enough of the side effects and have stopped completely. Docs want to taper but I can't handle the pains in my shoulders  I'm so scared now but I'm stopping and I'm off sick anyway. After reading all comments I wish they didn't put me on these but when your unwell you take it  - don't you.  I'm on quietapine now since yesterday so I'm preparing for a white knuckle ride if going cold turkey.	1	September 13, 2020	15
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Sleep Paralysis	I put up with parasomnia (hallucinations and acting out dreams) for 5 years before being properly diagnosed and put on Clonazepam. Started out at 0.5mg but increased to 1mg, and went from having regular hallucinations and ‘active dreams’ every night to sleeping solidly and feeling refreshed every day. This was my miracle drug. I’ve been on it for 5 years now... Currently weaning off it while pregnant, but I miss my sleep! It’s good stuff.	10	September 8, 2020	8
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Klonopin (clonazepam) for Panic Disorder	I work in Health care and obviously the last six months have been very stressful with COVID.  I've had crazy body symptoms and crazy thoughts running through my mind.  Klonopin has been a huge help in allowing me to work and remain centered and calm.  In fact, I'm probably wondering if I should have been on this medicine for the last 30 years.  Give it time and the fatigue will go away and the clear, calm mind will come.  That's how it worked for me.	10	September 5, 2020	95
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	I take .5mg of clonazepam  1-3 times per week as needed for anxiety, panic, OCD and insomnia.  It works gloriously.  Some nights when Lunesta will not get me over the sleep hump, I'll take 1/4 of a .5mg tablet and then I can sleep through the night without racing thoughts.  Only side effect I've noticed is hair shedding.	10	September 5, 2020	29
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Restless Legs Syndrome	I am beyond RLS, since diagnosed with fibromyalgia and RLS 25 years ago. My husband described me as sleeping with my toe attached to a car battery and every once in a while the switch is throw and her whole body jerks. I have been on clonazepam ever since, for the last 15 , no increase in dosage. In 2014, after a serious surgery, by day 2 I was jerking awake while on massive amounts of opioids which I refused as much as possible after day 3. I am tired of the FDA and doctors from proctologist to RNPA's. I might become addicted. Add in  I take 3 per night, and due to a 90 day ex I have to cut up pills because 7 months have 31.	10	September 5, 2020	8
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Obsessive Compulsive Disorder	I take clonazepam .5mg as needed, generally 2-3 times per week for OCD, anxiety and panic attacks.  No euphoria; it just quietly begins working within 1-2 hours.  If I take it to help me fall asleep, I generally take .5 mg or .5mg + 1/4 of another tablet.  30 tablets costs me less than $2.  The only side effect I have is hair shedding.  Initially, when I was having severe panic attacks and anxiety, I took .5mg everyday for three weeks before I finally calmed.  Only side effect I noticed with daily use was depression could set in and I needed to increase my dose for sleep.  But after a few weeks I was able to alternate back to Lunesta and occasionally I have a night where I can sleep without either.  This should be an option for patients like me who don't tolerate the side effects of a daily SSRI and do not have addictive tendencies.	10	September 1, 2020	4
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Bipolar Disorder	clonazepam really helps with my TMJ since all the other medications tend to work for a short duration. I was originally prescribed Klonopin for anxiety but noticed it really relaxes my muscles so I was able to get off my baclofen and Flexeril. I could have kept all 3 but told doc the other two were unnecessary.	10	August 31, 2020	4
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Restless Legs Syndrome	Was prescribed clonazepam .5mg once a day before bedtime for RLS. Worked well for a few weeks, but after 6 weeks of taking this drug I felt complacent and numb, and stopped enjoying activities. I am now off it for 3 days now and the withdrawal symptoms are evident, tired, irritable and anxious. However I do feel better today, more like myself and my sense of humour is returning. It appears this drug does work for many people but it was not for me. RLS significantly impacts ability to sleep and is difficult on lifestyle, good luck to others reading and I hope the post has been useful.	2	August 30, 2020	7
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Insomnia	clonazepam totally works for sleep and I never felt addicted.	10	August 28, 2020	50
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Klonopin (clonazepam) for Panic Disorder	Having been through two combat tours in the Army, psychologically I was not in great shape every vet is different, for me I was basically crippled by GAD and sometimes over 15 panic attacks a day, one rolling over into another. SSRIs (and I tried them all) helped but not enough to get me on an even keel so as to function in the world. I was 24 when my psychiatrist put me on Klonopin. 9 years later I have a wonderful wife, a beautiful son, and a career that brings me great pride.   NONE of this would have been possible without the help I received from taking Klonopin. There’s a lot of bias against benzos and it is very true that they can be abused. But for people that truly need them, it’s a disservice to this potential life saver. It helped me take my life back. I’m grateful to have Klonopin in my tool box even to this day. Seize the day people, go out there and get busy living. If Klonopin or another benzo can help, then just do it. Life is too short.	10	August 26, 2020	160
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Panic Disorder	Clonazepam .5mg stops my panic attacks.  Within one to two hours all panic is gone and I can sleep.  Used sparingly, no more than 2-3 times weekly, this is an excellent drug.	10	August 26, 2020	12
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Klonopin (clonazepam) for Panic Disorder	I used to take this medication  Klonopin years ago and it suited me fine. It was the first Benzo I ever tried. I eventually switched because it was causing my depression to get worse. Now I have been on Ativan and it works well. However I switched clinics and the put me back on klonopin. It has been a nightmare. All I want to do is sleep. My doc agreed to put me back on Ativan as well as vraylar. I hope this combo works.	2	August 25, 2020	12
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	I was on 0.5 - 1mg Klonopin daily for GAD and panic disorder for 6.5 years. Knowing what I know now about benzodiazepines, I'm not sure how my doctors ever let this fly. They should only be prescribed for short-term use (or on a PRN basis only), and certainly not daily use for YEARS on end. Withdrawals were a nightmare and it took months for me to feel back to normal again. When people talk about the withdrawals, they aren't joking... and this was with a SLOW AND STEADY taper!! Benzos like Klonopin absolutely serve a purpose and work very well, just make sure you take it daily short-term or if you are on it for a prolonged period of time, only as needed!	5	August 23, 2020	38
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	On Klonopinfor anxiety and insomnia. Klonopin saved my life. It also improved every relationship I treasure.  I've taken it for 8 years and my work has improved, my relationships have improved and I'm more relaxed.  Also, my base dose has NOT increased beyond 1.0 mg a day.  Often it's just .25mg a day.  Personally, I don't have any plan to stop taking it.  My wife says I'm better in everyday on it...including the bedroom. So there....:)	10	August 21, 2020	82
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Klonopin (clonazepam) for Panic Disorder	Klonopin is a very good drug. It is much safer than SRIs, SSRIs and Tricyclics which are over prescribed. Klonopin saved my like at home and in the ER. You see I suffer a Life threatening serotonin reaction with SSRIs. The Black box warning on new antianxiety medications is scary and people can't stop them.	10	August 19, 2020	31
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Restless Legs Syndrome	Stay away from benzodiazepines they’re meant for short term use. Discontinuing use is horrible.	3	August 16, 2020	11
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	On clonazepam To treat my Restless Leg Syndrome and anxiety. Finally I feel normal and I am seizure free. Combine with dopamine and serotonin reuptake meds also gabapentine, I can't describe the normal feeling for the first time and no insomnia (for more than 20 years). But sadly after my neurologist reduce the dosage, I feel terrible. I don't know if this is withdrawal. But I'm thankful for this med.	10	August 14, 2020	23
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Migraine Prevention	Have 2 kinds of epilepsy since 16 yo. Then at 38 years old developed left side migraine encompassing tempero-parietal migraine, with sharp pain across the left brow, down through the eye, across the maxilla and includes numbness of the left face to midline of the lips. Then beginning 2.5 years ago, I was struck with new additional areas of migraine: right parietal and right frontal.  This right frontal feels as though someone from ancient Egypt is attempting to drill a huge hole through my skull.  The pain is incredibly intense and 10 out of 10.  Having taken every every drug I am clinically qualified to take to date, I only recently administered my loading dose of Emgality.  So far, no joy.  So, since my frontal migraine is giving me such pain today, I took a clonazepam one hour ago, then found this forum of sorts.  My outcome after one hour (I took it with rather warm decaf coffee with hemp milk): I can honestly say my pain has decreased by at least 50% and I am impressed.	5	August 12, 2020	9
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Night Terrors	I have taken Clonazepam for over 4 years. I take it T.I.D. Three Times Daily, 3-4Mg split in three.  (1mg,1mg,1-2mg) I take it for PTSD symptoms that I experience. It is quite effective for GAD, and keeping panic attacks away. But, It only lasts about 6-8 hours, thus I take it TID. I still have terrible nightmares, I sleep about 4 hours and wake up from a bad dream. I started splitting my evening dose into 2. Taking half at 8Pm and the other half at 9-10... This helps me stay asleep longer. I still wake up with bruises, from thrashing in my sleep or wake up with a gasp/scream. For certain problems this medication is effective. But for night terrors it is not for me. Since I do not get a full REM cycle. I do not get compete rest, I need a nap. And because of my exhaustion I quickly move into the dream state of REM and have nightmares and then wake up. Not to mention it is physically addictive and it will take year(s) to reduce my dose to 0.	5	August 8, 2020	7
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	I've always taken clonazepam as prescribed for severe anxiety. Tolerance developed quickly and Drs kept upping my dose while adding other medications. Up until 2 years ago I would have given it a 10 as  I had no idea what was happening or coming at me. It has messed up my blood pressure and I have tachycardia now so I need to get off it. THIS IS AWFUL. I have been on 1 mg 2 x daily and down to 1.5 a day. I don't know if I can get to 1 mg a day. Believe every horror story on here because if you ever want/need off this ride you better buckle up.  Find another way. Don't make this an option.	1	July 29, 2020	34
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Benzodiazepine Withdrawal	I've been on Clonazepam for 7 years recently I started feeling hazy and my brain hurt. In fact, it still does. I thought it was another medication causing me all these issues but after successfully withdrawing from that medication my symptoms stayed on board. Now I am working with my Doctor to wean off clonazepam. I was prescribed a mood stabilizer however it was making things worse. Fortunately I did not take that medication for very long. I want to feel better and I am deeply disturbed that my Doctor would keep me on a medication meant for short term use. I am nervous about withdraw but I am so ready to be myself again.

Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Migraine Prevention	I had these awful headaches, it felt like a tight band around my head and it was coupled with severe pain. I told my psychiatrist and he prescribed 0.5mg of clonazepam. Within a day my headaches went away. I tried lowering my dose every 3 months but the headache would come back. I was on it for over a year when I read more about headaches online, I came across a type of headache with symptoms similar to mine and one of the recommendations was magnesium. I took 25mg/day of magnesium for 1 week then cut down my clonazepam and my headaches where gone. However after being on it for over a year discontinuing clonazepam proved to be hard. I tried quitting cold turkey and had withdrawals within 2 days. I had to slowly taper down over a period of 4 months but I experienced 3 weeks of withdrawals after my final dose. A week of magnesium vs 1.5 years of clonazepam. I give this drug an 7 because it worked but I deducted 3 points because its hard to discontinue once you develop a dependency.	7	July 19, 2020	12
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Benzodiazepine Withdrawal	"I took 0.5 KLONOPIN FOR 4 MONTHS and now I am physically addicted, I never used it to get ""high"", I just used it as prescribed, it is not a high dose.  But I have HORRIBLE WITHDRAWAL when I stop including using horrible mental anguish ...."	1	July 3, 2020	46
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	Ive been on numerous medications over the last 20 years. Including xanax. About 15 years ago my doctor put me on klonopin. For the first time I felt better. About 5 years later I switched insurance company's and had my new doctor switch me to xanax. Which worked fine. After that I've had about  4 different psychiatrist and none of them liked xanax so they took me off of them. And put me on other meds that did not work. So I've suffered for the last 4 years. I have PTSD and anxiety. Finally I just got a new psychiatrist and she put me back on klonopin. And I'm so relieved.  I feel so much better. Don't let anyone tell you its a bad medication. I never had withdrawals years ago when I quit taking them. They have helped me better than any other medication.		June 26, 2020	101
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Insomnia	This drug Klonopin has got to be my least favorite that I have ever tried. I have nocturnal epilepsy which causes nightmares, daytime sleepiness, and anxiety. This drug was prescribed because it is supposed to help all of those. It made me insanely tired when I would take it. I couldn't function afterwards and would fall asleep. The worst part were the dreams. Naturally if we sleep 8 hours it doesn't feel like 8 hours. On Klonopin I felt every single second of the night. It was awful and miserable. In my dream I would walk around a clothing store for hours and FEEL each material. If water dropped on me I would absolutely feel the wetness. Not in a good way. ALSO importantly, I am in college and normally drink quite heavily. If I took Klonopin I would become extremely nauseous and black out after a few sips. If you take this drug, absolutely do not drink while on it.	1	June 24, 2020	21
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Night Terrors	I have a very passionate relationship with this medication. I love it and I despise it. It has caused memory loss, extreme sedation in inappropriate times, and its one hard drug to kick. It took me over a year to get off of this medication and I had to take 0.25mg every other day for about three weeks at the end it before I finally had rational thought patterns. I hate sleeping and suffer from PTSD. While it managed my symptoms, I became a dissociated mindless zombie at the end of my use of the medication.	7	June 24, 2020	4
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Restless Legs Syndrome	After years of RLS my Neurosurgeon tried me on Klonopin. The first night I took it, I didn't have the pain and restless legs that I had suffered with for years. I would highly recommend this drug to anyone who suffers with RLS.	10	June 19, 2020	11
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Benzodiazepine Withdrawal	I've been on Klopin for 14 years.  Started at 1mg in the beginning and went up 2mg every night to help with sleeping and anxiety. This drug is the most difficult drug to cut back on. I've come off Vicodion, Opiates, Tramadal, and most recently a long term everyday Cocain addiction. By far Klopin is the is the hardest to withdrawal from. I abused Klopin and was taking up to 3.5mg a night and mix that in with Cocaine addiction and withdrawal. To be honest I'm not sure how I never went to the hospital. Unfortunately I have a high tolerance for pills and managed to run a business and maintain a somewhat normal life. On top of everything I'm bipolar with a major addiction problem. Finally decided that I need and want a life without drugs. To everyone going through this process there is a silver lining and the Klopin fog will get better and in return make you a stronger person. A little discomfort but the result is the greatest feeling in the world not having to rely on a pill.	3	June 14, 2020	82
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Klonopin (clonazepam) for Panic Disorder	Just because your particular biochemistry had a bad reaction, does not mean a certain drug is bad for everyone. Benzos get a bad rep because of their dependency nature. I will tell you that I have suffered with anxiety, OCD for many years. I have tried other medicines. They have bad side effects. I have tried natural alternatives, although they do work a little bit - it's only a little bit. The upside is they rarely have any side effects. So if you can have a natural supplement work for you, go that route. However I will say that I am someone that does not like to take pharm medicine and if I have the need for Klonopin, I only try to take it every few days or so. But I will tell you, when I do take it, it's absolutely the only thing that has worked. It does not make me feel weird, groggy or zombie-like. It makes me feel back to my normal, natural me, calm content and just overall good! People that advocate against Klonopin are doing a disservice to people that the drug is helpful for.	9	June 11, 2020	163
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Restless Legs Syndrome	I take 1-2 Clonazepam at night for my RLS and it helps dramatically. I am thankful to my neurologist for prescribing this medication for me.	10	June 9, 2020	14
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	This clonazepam has been a godsend for me. I have severe anxiety and possible panic disorder, so whenever I feel really bad anxiety I take 0.5 mg and feel better within 20-35 minutes. It can also help me sleep sometimes, which is a plus.  The only con is that if you take this during the day (I've had to many times) you WILL get drowsy. Other than that, this medication has been amazing for me. I'd definitely recommend it, although everybody is different.	9	June 9, 2020	78
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Klonopin (clonazepam) for Panic Disorder	Ok here goes Klonopin is by far the best drug for anxiety period for me.  Everyone is different of course and I have never felt the need to take more then necessary in fact I always try and take less.  SSRIs did nothing for me in fact they made me more anxious.  Any drug if taken too much or abused can cause you serious issues, also keep who your reviewers are me included, most people who have a bad experience will review, good experiences don't even think about doing a review.  I think the ratings would be closer to 9.5 if everyone took the time to write a review that was a positive one.  As we all know people are more likely  to comment when they have negative outcomes and that’s understandable.  People who take this medication also tend to have anxiety, panic, GAD like myself and can be very in touch with every perceived symptom within their body.  In my opinion way more then the average Joe walking down the street.  In other words take these reviews for what they are worth.  A single persons opinion and often a person that is suffering to find anything that will make them feel better.	10	June 9, 2020	117
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Anxiety	This medicine helped me a lot with my problem which is caused by anxiety. I couldn't sleep so my psychiatrist told me to take 1/4 before going to sleep. Now I am afraid that I am addicted.	9	June 6, 2020	30
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Insomnia	I’ve been on 2mg of Clonazepam for 3 years every night for insomnia. About 6 months ago, I suddenly was no longer able to fall asleep.    My dr. agreed that the benzo was no longer even working. He suggested I take 5 mg of liquid melatonin, and increase it by 5 mg every other night until I fell asleep easily. At 15 mg, I fell asleep easily!  After taking the melatonin for 6 weeks, he had me cut my clonazepam pill 25%. Still fell asleep great.  At 10 days, he had me cut it 50%!! Still, I fell asleep easily, and stayed asleep all night! I stayed at the 50% cut for 3 weeks, and then cut it down 75%! After 2 more weeks, I stopped taking it completely.     I’ve had ZERO symptoms & sleep great. I still take the 15mg melatonin every night and that’s all.  I know this is not a forum for discontinuation, but I wanted to share in case it could help someone else.   I suffered for 10 years with horrible, horrible  insomnia.		June 4, 2020	193
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Panic Disorder	Great at first but when it stops working it is awful withdrawal symptoms and I'm still on it! My advice Stay Away from benzos.	2	June 4, 2020	3
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Restless Legs Syndrome	I take it 3 times a week per drs opinion but can’t sleep on other days and restless legs are more frequent	10	June 1, 2020	5
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Klonopin (clonazepam) for Panic Disorder	I take Klonopin for Rem Behavior Disorder and Anxiety. Thank God for this medication, 0.5mgs twice has saved my life.	10	May 31, 2020	55
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Sleep Paralysis	I'm 61 yrs old. I started having sleep paralysis with hallucinations upon waking when I was 17 yrs old. It happened ver frequently. I started taking Clonazepam in my early 40s. After a few years I realized I wasn't having this horrible experience anymore. I did an experiment by going off Clonazepam twice and both time the sleep paralysis with hallucinations came back. I will take this medication until the day I die! This medical condition, especially with hallucinations, is so horrible, I would never even wish it on my worst enemy. I hope this helps even one individual!!!	10	May 26, 2020	14
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Restless Legs Syndrome	I have had RLS since I was a little kid.  It runs in my family.   As I got older it got worse, I went years without sleeping. I even chose a career where I was on my feet and not sitting, and night shift.  In my 40s they came out with RLS meds, I tried them all. Not one worked and the side effects were horrible.   I finally tried clonazepam 1mg once a day at night. I slept through the night for the first time. I have been on it for 10 years, have not increased the dosage and it still works. But the issue is the generic.  Depends on what company and color of the pill.  Yellow always worked, green sometimes but the multiple blues were a hit and miss.  RLS is horrible and life altering.  I’m thankful I have an understanding Dr. willing to prescribe it for me.	10	May 21, 2020	26
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Restless Legs Syndrome	I am 76 yrs old, Had severe leg cramps at night for more than 20 years. Been on Clonazepam for all that  time. Started with 0.5mg increased to 1mg at night. Worked miracles. I was since prescribed Indapimied 2.5mgin the morning. Severe leg cramps returned. Ridaq 12.mg then prescribed instead of Idapimied. Leg cramps then less severe. Tried Clonazepam 0.5mg and leg cramp severity decreased. Dropped Clonazepam entirely and leg cramps became unbearable. Went back to Clonazepam 1Mg and leg cramps were less severe (not mild). Am about to try Clonazepam 1.5mg. I still function normally as can be expected for a person my age. Memory is commensurate with my age. A bit forgetful but not nearly Altzheimer or Dementia (Note that I'm typing this on a tablet with nobody assisting me. I in fact assist many in the coastal town that I live in to set up their computers & phones etc.) I never had any side effects or withdrawal symptoms. I think Clonazepam is a great drug and very effective.	10	May 14, 2020	24
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Benzodiazepine Withdrawal	Been on Benzos for many years. I've decided last September to taper off slowly. Well by middle of February of 2020 I was off them completely for 12 days. Unfortunately my OCD and anxiety came back so strong that I felt I was going to go crazy. I couldn't sleep or eat or think straight. So I went back to one pill a day and of course symptoms vanished. I still want off them but the withdrawl drives me to point I wonder if I will survive......Help!!!! Any suggestions?	1	May 11, 2020	76
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Panic Disorder	I have been taking Clonazepam.05 mg twice a day for over 20 years.  Recently my doctor did a urine test and I had a blood test also and failed it 3 times. I have a follow up phone call tomorrow and I am so scared he is going to take me off. Before I went on the med I lost 10  productive years of my life wishing God would take me. Clonazepam is the only thing that works for me to live a so called life. About 3 months ago my prescription was made by a company called Accord? I swear it’s the culprit and trying to explain this to my doctor. I think he thinks I’m selling theses pills. Please can someone help me. I’m so scared.	10	May 4, 2020	19
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Panic Disorder	I have NOT always been “medication complacent” as they say. Which has gotten me in trouble, in life.  When my psychiatrist prescribed clonazepam, I just imagined it being like all the rest... Taking forever waiting for it to build up in my system, while dealing with all the quintessential intermittent Side effects.  That is not what happened, at least to me it work immediately. It’s helps me with my mood swings, PMDD, Sciatic nerve pain, & my PTSD I do not take it everyday, just in certain situations. Like prior to my Menstrual cycle, it is important I do.  For those of you that aren’t good at taking meds, for your own personal reason but suffer from a mood disorder I suggest trying this.	10	May 1, 2020	14
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Benzodiazepine Withdrawal	I'm very aware of the dangers and the suffering of benzo withdrawal--I've gone through it multiple times and I'm only 25. However, I'm going to detail the successful tapering schedule I did using Klonopin. I was taking 2mg for two years and this is how I successfully got off--I did 1.75mg for a week, 1.5mg for a week, 1.25mg for a week, 1mg for a week, .875 mg for a week, .75mg for a week, .625mg for a week, .5mg for a week, .325mg for a week, .25mg for a week, .125mg for a week, and then I jumped off. No, it wasn't easy, but it sure beat rapid withdrawal in a detox center and then going insane for months. I suggest trying what I did and you can prolong the cuts as well (instead of holding for one week, hold for two? three? a month?). Be well everyone and good luck with the fight!	8	April 24, 2020	200
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Benzodiazepine Withdrawal	Sad to read all these bad experiences I guess I am a lucky one. I started with 4mg dose (a very high starting dose yes! If I only had known back then...) for severe GAD 2+ years ago and was instructed to take 4mg at once before going to bed which I did around a year. Then I kind of skipped doses and there were multiple days in a row I didn't take anything, on some days just a 1mg and now I am taking 1mg a few times a week if even that. Haven't had any kind of side effects or negative symptoms so far. Now, that Covid-19 is here, I have decided to take even less and eventually (hopefully) stop this for good. GAD still exists though but the medicine has helped me through some tough spots. I guess this medicine is very different on the individual level.	9	April 11, 2020	59
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Klonopin (clonazepam) for Seizure Prevention	Was originally on 400 mg of zonisamide that started at 200 mg and still had breakthrough seizures. Was given .5 clonazepam. Worked great.  Got taken off it for a study. When I was put back on they gave me zonisamide and vimpat. Still had seizures. Started clonazepam again. Seizure free.	10	April 11, 2020	22
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Burning Mouth Syndrome	I was perfectly normal until March of 2019 when I had a  molar tooth prepped for a crown to replace a PFM crown that was 25 years old. I then had to have a root canal on the tooth, which is when all my symptoms began. Severe plastic/metallic taste in my mouth with severe burning tongue sensation. After that I went through a series of attempts to have the final crown made and placed, and with each attempt, my symptoms became worse until I almost went into shock from a severe allergic reaction. I found this site and my doctor was kind enough to prescribe dissolving clonazepam tablets, but they have cherry flavoring, which cannot have. At this time I am using a plain tablet dissolved in water and swishing in my mouth, hoping that this will finally give me some relief from this torment of metallic taste and burning mouth. Hoping this will work somehow.	3	March 28, 2020	10
Accel-clonazePAM (Oral)	Panic Disorder	Been on this medication clonazepam for 4 months. I take 0.5 as needed for panic attacks. It's been a life saver. Veteran Affairs refused to prescribe this to combat soldiers like myself that struggle with PTSD. They just load you up on a cocktail of ineffective drugs that make you a zombie. So I went through community care for an outside Doctor. Best decision I ever made. I had been living with depression and panic attacks for 12 years and the VA never helped once. Not anymore. I have only experienced mild drowsiness and might misplace my keys every now and then. I'll take that trade off any day. It works great for me. Start of with a low dose until you know what works for you.	9	March 11, 2020	20
AccessPak for HIV PEP Basic	Nonoccupational Exposure	I was prescribed PEP after a condom slipped off during vaginal intercourse. As it turns out, I did not need the treatment and the doctor wasn't supposed to prescribe it to me under those circumstances. I was told side effects were mild and nothing long-term. Developed abdominal issues 2 weeks in. Was told not to worry, that was normal and it would pass. I was on treatment for one month. It's been 8 months since it ended but the issues have only gotten worse. I'm in crippling pain most of the time. I have trouble keeping any weight on. I'm afraid to eat because I know will happen after that. It's getting to the point where I won't be able to work soon. I've had several tests done but they can't figure it out. My life is a living nightmare now. I would give anything if I could go back and not take these drugs. They made me sign a waver before which should have been a red flag I guess. Whatever you do DO NOT TAKE THESE DRUGS unless you are ABSOLUTELY POSITIVE that it is 100% NECESSARY!!!	1	November 26, 2019	0
Acclean	Gingivitis	After hygienist cleaned all four quadrants he stated that I must use a mouthwash RX grade called Acclean for 2 weeks after brushing my teeth to rinse and then spit out. I did as he requested and it stained my teeth brownish  very badly especially the bottom half of the tooth closer to the gums. Tried everything to clean them to no avail. Went back to the hygienist he did a cleaning but stains still remain in the back teeth especially and some of the teeth have spotting. The top portion of each tooth seems to have turned slightly transparent as compared to the bottom half of the tooth which is darker and not transparent. NOT A HAPPY CAMPER!!!	1	December 23, 2017	32
Acclean 60 Second Fluoride Treatment	Clinpro 5000 (fluoride)	I'm a long-term user of Clinpro.  Recently, the tubing has become more difficult to use. I can no longer cope with the challenges it presents.  I've cancelled out of future orders. They made a big mistake.  Goodbye Clinpro.     Grove	1	April 8, 2021	0
Acclean 60 Second Fluoride Treatment	Fluoridex Daily Defense (fluoride)	I have been using Fluoridex prescription toothpaste for about 5 years as recommended by my dentist. It works great as I have not had a cavity in those 5 years. I just started using the daily defence rinse as well and it is also a wonderful product. As long as I can go to the dentist and only need cleanings it is worth my while to keep using it. I've had zero side effects, and have had no problems opening the tube	10	January 19, 2021	0
Acclean 60 Second Fluoride Treatment	PreviDent 5000 Booster (fluoride)	I have used Prevident 5000 for many years.  This was first prescribed to me by my periodontist. Unfortunately, I have  hereditary perio dental issues (caries & gums).  In order to keep my teeth and gums from becoming progressively worse, I was prescribed and have been using this product in place of any/all toothpaste. I must say, I have not gotten a cavity and my gums are in stable condition. To date, great product!	9	October 28, 2020	1
Acclean 60 Second Fluoride Treatment	Denta 5000 Plus (fluoride)	I'm wondering if it can cause hair loss after using for about 8 months 2x a day?	8	October 26, 2020	0
Acclean 60 Second Fluoride Treatment	Fluoridex (fluoride)	I have been using Floridex once a day. It is an OK toothpaste, but seems to leave a film on my teeth which I can taste throughout the day. It also causes my gums to burn slightly. I don’t think I will continue to use.	6	August 1, 2020	2
Acclean 60 Second Fluoride Treatment	SF 5000 Plus (fluoride)	I was using Prevident made by Colgate.  It tasted great. I think it is spearmint flavor. My teeth felt clean. That one comes in a small squeeze 3.4 oz bottle , a little less than double this SF 5000 Plus which is 1.8 oz.  Prevident is 3x the price with my Rx plan so I tried this one.  It's very dull.  No flavor. I don't feel my mouth feels fresh. I had to mix it with regular toothpaste in the Prevident bottle. The pharmacy can only get me this or the Prevident.  I'm getting a refill of this SF 5000 Plus. This time I will squeeze it into the bottle and add a drop or two of peppermint oil. That should help the flavor and give me a fresh taste. If you have to use this one and have the same experience that is has no taste, find a small container or something you can dip your toothbrush in and put a drop or two of some kind of flavoring to freshen it up  The company needs to spruce up this stuff. It's bland. I couldn't find how to contact them.	5	May 11, 2020	3
Acclean 60 Second Fluoride Treatment	Pro-Den Rx (fluoride)	Makes your mouth very dry and tastes TERRIBLE. I had to use this for 14 days and all I wanted to do was skip it. I dreaded using this every day.	1	August 22, 2019	7
Acclean 60 Second Fluoride Treatment	Perio Med (fluoride)	I was given periogel by my dentist to prevent the return of my gum disease. I was thrilled that there was a product that would help keep it from coming back. I immediately started using the periogel everyday for 15 minutes. The day after I started using it I got very sick and thought I had food poisoning from a salad bar where I had eaten lunch. I continued feeling sick with stomach pain and diarrhea for over a month and I thought that I had lingering problems from food poisoning. I made an appt. with my doctor and decided to go off the gel to see what would happen. The next day I felt much better and 3 days later was completely back to normal. Needless to say I am upset that I was not told about any side effects.	1	June 6, 2019	10
Acclean 60 Second Fluoride Treatment	Fluoridex Daily Defense (fluoride)	I was given this (Fluoridex Daily Defense) by my dentist and reluctantly used it starting a couple years ago (early 2017). I was told to use it, spit out the toothpaste, but not rinse. While using this toothpaste, I had some stomach/GI issues occur. I thought it was my diet and I even went to the doctor to investigate, but could not locate any issue. The symptoms showed up gradually, but I would have sharp pains in my lower right abdomen/stomach area, along with bloating. Generally, these would occur in the middle of the night/morning and get better as the day went on, but still persisted.  I had a light bulb moment at the beginning of 2019 wondering if this was causing my persistent issues.  In 2017 (shortly after I started using it) I had muscle issues/tendonitis/sensitivity in both elbows and numbness in my fingers in the night, along with loss of grip strength. Since ceasing utilizing the toothpaste, my tendonitis and other symptoms are basically non-existent.	1	May 4, 2019	10
Acclean 60 Second Fluoride Treatment	Clinpro 5000 (fluoride)	Our dentist gave this to my 10 year-old daughter, and she began to use it. A week later, she developed a stomachache. We took her to the doctor, tried a bland diet, probiotics...everything we could. After a month of frustration and tears, it struck me that she'd been using this toothpaste. I did some research, and sure enough, she had all the symptoms of fluoride poisoning. We had her stop using it. It's taken some time, but she's recovered.	1	October 8, 2018	25
Acclean 60 Second Fluoride Treatment	Clinpro 5000 (fluoride)	I tried clinpro 5000 given  to me by my dentist,  It helped my teeth but caused me to have all kinds of stomach  problems. Please try hard not to swallow it as bloating and gas occurs immediately.	1	October 5, 2018	18
Acclean 60 Second Fluoride Treatment		"Product seemed okay, but it practically took a pair of pliers to OPEN the blasted top! Called the company and representative mentioned that they were aware of the problem. ""We have contacted the manufacturer of those tops to request that they be improved,"" she stated.   Could I please get a replacement tube? ""No, there is nothing we can do."" Seriously? I have MY own company and I know that there is ALWAYS ""something you can do"" for the customer.  Would never purchase this product again!"	4	August 7, 2018	1
Acclean 60 Second Fluoride Treatment	Fluoridex (fluoride)	This prescription strength anti cavity toothpaste may be good at preventing cavities, but opening the cap is nearly impossible. The catch is so strong that it takes a lot of twisting & heavy leverage to get the cap to snap open. We've gone thru 4 tubes now & all of them were the same, so it's not just a temporary manufacturing glitch. It's a poorly designed snap cap.	3	July 2, 2018	6
Acclean 60 Second Fluoride Treatment	Pro-Den Rx (fluoride)	"It may be good medicinally, however, the taste is TERRIBLE and caused ""instant dry-mouth"" to me.  Having to formulate the mixture myself before using is NOT ""user friendly"".  The taste alone turned me off completely!!!"	1	May 25, 2018	6
Acclean 60 Second Fluoride Treatment	Pro-Den Rx (fluoride)	I was instructed to rinse with the mouth rinse for 14 days before bed to help my gums. After about day 9 I started to wake up with swollen lips and a weird feeling in my mouth. It is day 13 and I think I will not be using it the last day my mouth is sore with patches that feel raw and very uncomfortable.	1	January 4, 2018	10
Acclean 60 Second Fluoride Treatment	Pro-Den Rx (fluoride)	I have experienced severe dry mouth after using Pro-denRX aqueous gel for teeth brushing.  I used it for three weeks before I finally realized that my dry mouth started when I began the use of the toothpaste.  I have stopped using Pro-denRX and hope the side effects will eventually disappear.  It has only been two days since I stopped use, so it is too early to tell much.  My mouth is still severely dry.	1	November 2, 2017	10

Accucaine		I went today for a lidocaine infusion for fibromyalgia.  I went in with the only fear of the IV. After reading a few reviews,  I was not worried but mentally prepared.  I did not have any reactions or side effects. I was able to get up after a little over a hour put my boots on and walk out. I was able to get my errands done after. My pain going in was a 7 and within 10 minutes down to 0. Even my lower back from my spinal fusion felt great until I started shopping. Now its been a few hours and other than a very rare 2 from my back I have no pain.	10	January 19, 2021	1
Accucaine	Anesthesia	Lidocaine was injected to remove a suspect mole on my arm. Within minutes I had uncontrollable tremors  from mid chest radiating to my legs. I realized  that over the years I had experienced this reaction during prior procedures  when administered this drug. ( ie: dental)  The severity of the reaction has been cumulative with the last 2 being the most severe and frightening. My GP believes it’s a neurological  response rather than classic allergy. There are 2 groups of local anesthetic Amides  and Ester. Lidocaine is an Amide .  My dentist, ophthalmologist and dermatologist take my history seriously and do not use drugs from the Amides group. I seem to do find on Esters.	1	December 26, 2020	2
Accucaine	Anesthesia	Lidocaine is mixed with epinephrine, and it's the epinephrine which is causing many people's reactions.  Epinephrine speeds up heart rate.  Lidocaine is available without epinephrine.  The effect of epinephrine on the patient allows medical personnel to avoid using too much lidocaine, since epinephrine side effects are detectable.	10	May 30, 2020	5
Accucaine		I have Chronic back pain , fibromyalgia arthritis and was reluctant but went through with the first treatment with systemic lidocaine It did nothing , it didn't even make drowsy. It was a waste of time and 3 mth wait	1	February 24, 2020	2
Accucaine	Costochondritis	I had severe back pain for years along my bra line area Degenerative disc disease. I would wake up in the night in such bad pain it would be hard for me to take a breath. After seeing many doctors and taking many different pain pills I was referred to a pain specialist who gave me lidocaine injections into the sore spots of my back. I felt instant relief. And was relatively pain-free for six months and had to go again. This felt like a miracle, after trying so many different things, to be able to tolerate the pain I  continue to have. I wish I would have been told about lidocaine injections a lot sooner!	10	October 22, 2019	10
Accucaine	Anesthesia	I had terrible adverse reactions from Lidocaine after several dentist visits. Every time I received a Lidocaine injection it felt like I was having a heart attack (it was actually SEVERE heart palpitations), made me feel cold, and at one point triggered a minor seizure. I also have epilepsy so it is very possible that Lidocaine is not recommended for anyone with serious conditions (but my dentists kept using it anyway). Be careful if you are considering using Lidocaine as a local anesthetic.	1	June 12, 2019	4
Accucaine	L-Caine (lidocaine) for Anesthesia	Not a great deal of relief in both lumber spine,hips and legs also the problems have at levels C6,C7 much the same. Side effects great loss of bowel control, not nice.	5	October 10, 2018	2
Accucaine	Anesthesia	I have used 5% lidocaine patches for sciatica and bursitis in my thighs. I can usually sit only for 10 to 15 minutes before the pain becomes unbearable. A patch takes about 5 minutes to completely relieve the pain for the day.   That problem has cleared but now I have a broken leg requiring a lot of sitting and lying down. The pain is back when I sit but now my insurance, United Health Care, has denied approval to use it so I could only sit when I had to for the last 4 weeks, otherwise stand or lie down. Wheel chairs can't be used for longer than 10 to 15 minutes at a time.   The 5% patches are great if you can get them.		March 1, 2018	6
Accucaine	Anesthesia	I used this after having a tooth pulled - it caused nausea 	10	April 3, 2017	2
Accupril	High Blood Pressure	Have had no debilitating side effects from this medication at 10mg.   I did notice on my last blood test my Potassium was up but not out of range.  Was tired for first few weeks, get cold hands and feet if outside but it's manageable.  The effects of this medicine seem to diminish after starting my bp is slowly rising I have gained some weight which might have caused the increase working on removing the excess now.

Accutane	Acne	WISH I HAD TAKEN ACCUTANE A DECADE SOONER. Refractory to every birth control, topical treatment, antibiotic, diet. Several dermatologists recommended but I had heard negative things and hoped it would disappear by my mid 20's. It didn't and once I had a steady job with good health insurance I found a conveniently located experienced dermatologist  practice and started 30mg daily for 1st month (I weigh 135 lb), then 40mg daily for 6 months. We discussed increasing to 60mg but I had good results and wanted to keep side effects manageable. The 1st month a few more cysts on my back, after that ~1 tiny pimple per month that resolved quickly, a year later skin has stayed clear and scarring is lighter with topical acids. Triglycerides increased 1 month likely related to labs not being taken fasting, first week dose increased I had diarrhea, slightly tired and less social, dry (constantly drinking water and moisturizing), mild muscle pain toward the end, and derm mentioned poor wound healing can occur.	9	April 25, 2021	0
Accutane	Acne	For background, I am a female in my mid-20s. I took 40 mg of Accutane for 8 months (on and off, since I sometimes I had to stop to take antibiotics). I had no other health problems other than depression and anxiety prior to taking Accutane. Neither of these conditions worsened or improved for me while on the drug.   This drug does what it says it will do. The acne on my chest and back has completely cleared and not come back. I only get hormonal breakouts before my period now.  The prominent side effects that I experienced were hair loss, weight gain (not due to the medication, but having to take Accutane with a high fat meal, feeling more tired on drug etc.), and body aches.   I am still coping with hair loss, but my dermatologist has said it is temporary. And joint pains from the medication. If I do not drink a lot of water throughout the day, then my joints start to feel really stiff. But other than that, I did not experience any other lasting side effects.	9	April 23, 2021	1
Accutane	Acne	"I took accutane a year ago and I want people to know that skin maintenance after can be very complicated to find what works for you. I've been taking adapelene 0.3 percent since then to treat acne scars and potential new acne and this leaves my skin very very red, dry and sensitive. It took me a year to figure out a moisturize that would work for me, and that it was alright to use the moisturize right after applying the adapelene. I've tried many many products and ""Rugged AND Dapper Age and Damage Defense Facial Moistuizer"" on Amazon finally does the trick (I'm a man). Good Luck! Share your own tips!"	6	April 23, 2021	0
Accutane	Acne	Accutane saved my life. I had developed severe cystic acne after stopping the birth control pill. For a few years I tried everything (diets, vitamins, topicals, you name it) to get rid of the horrible acne that had ruined my life. I was so so so scared to try accutane, but at this point it was either this or I might as well give up on life. I did a longer course of 20mg a day, I think it was 8 or 9 months. Not all doctors will accept to prescribe such a low dose, but it was what I was comfortable with, and the medication works in a cumulative way, meaning you can take it for longer with a low dose, and the results should be equivalent to shorter treatment with a higher dose, but with potentially less side effects. It's 6 years later and I can confidently say this drug saved my life, my acne is gone and I have not had any severe side effects.	10	April 18, 2021	0
Accutane	Acne	I am 72 yr old and just recently suggested Accutane 20 mg after 2.5 yr of different treatments for acne.  Milia, cysts and blackheads but no pimples mostly on chins, cheeks and forehead.   I have been fortunate to not be wrinkled ( Mom’s) genes. I’m afraid at this age that Accutane will start the dreaded wrinkle process faster than it is now.   Should I start Accutane or keep on trying any and everything my dermatologist recommends or OTC?

Accutane	Acne	I just wanted to come on here and let anyone that was thinking about taking this terrible prescription know what happened to my mother. She took it for 4-6 months in 2007-2008 and it devastated her body. Before she was a healthy woman after she fought skin lesions, sores, severe arthritis, carpal tunnel, severe stomach issues, depression, anxiety, & suicidal thoughts. She had seen LOTS of doctors and most told her it was all in her head or something of the sorts.  After 12 years of battling severe pain mentally and physically she took her own life a week ago. It may not happen to everyone but I just wanted to let everyone know what the possibility was.	1	March 22, 2021	7
Accutane	Acne	Two courses did not work (acne came back twice) and gave me chronic long-term side effects.	1	February 13, 2021	6
Accutane	Acne	I started this medication 3 months ago and today my doctor and I decided to stop taking it. 2 months into it, I developed severe depression, pretty much all of the side effects that it lists on the inside of the medicine packet. Aggressiveness, irritability, crying spells, feelings of worthlessness and guilt, the list goes on. It cleared my moderate acne very well so I was very disappointed that I had to stop, but I didn’t know if the depression would stay with me in the long term if I stuck with it. In the first month I took two weeks off due to it causing back pain. I also had dry scalp, minimal lip dryness, and purging. Although this medication was not for me, my brother took it when he was a teenager and he had great results. His face is clear and as far as I know he hasn’t had one pimple pop back up. Hope this helps.	5	January 28, 2021	8
Accutane	Acne	I took accutane 20 years ago and have had extremely dry skin since. Dry mouth, dry eyes, dry skin, dry nose. My nose has a constant scab in it from cracking. Bleeds occasionally. The price of vanity is large. Be careful and good luck	3	January 25, 2021	4
Accutane	Acne	My son had terrible acne on his back and face. We were worried about the side effects of this treatment, Accutane, but the side effects were worth enduring as he now has beautiful skin. He had sore lips but used paw paw ointment, a small price to pay for his now great skin. Stay off oily foods, dairy and fatty meat and fish - the oil comes out in some people’s skin. Almonds and some nuts can also aggravate the skin. For people suffering from acne, I would recommend that they give this treatment a good try.	10	January 15, 2021	7
Accutane	Acne	This is my third time on Accutane, unfortunately it hasn’t kept my skin clear forever- only for 1-2 years. However my family has severe acne and my brothers and sister (my brothers had worse skin then I have) all have been on one round of Accutane and have kept their skin clear for 3+ years after. This time around I am starting on a higher dose so I am optimistic it will work. Symptoms I got were chapped lips, dry hands, eczema patches, and sore joints. My skin got worse before it got better however in my opinion it’s totally worth the long 6 months. My skin was extremely dry the first week but I got it under control with Cerave moisturizers, vasaline, no7 hydrating mask and a powerful humidifier! This works on my eczema as well.  The only symptoms that I can’t control are the sore joints but it has subsided after all my treatments and has still allowed me to workout. Highly recommend for severe acne cases, who have tried everything else!	10	January 13, 2021	5
Accutane	Acne	I took accutane at 17 years old. I was on 30mg for 2 months and 60mg for 4 months. I got rid of my cystic acne on my face, chest, and back. I still have scarring but my skin looks so much better! Some side effects I experienced included, dry skin, nose bleeds, and dry eyes. However, it was all WORTH IT! Accutane changed my life for the better. I've never felt so confident in my skin. I struggled with acne my entire life and my only regret is not starting it sooner. I started seeing it work after only 10 days. I can't recommend accutane enough. My advice is to advocate for yourself and keep asking for it over and over again until they give it to you. Accutane didn't change my life, it saved my life!	10	December 31, 2020	6
Accutane	Acne	I had a very positive experience with accutane. I didn't have acne when I was young. I started getting them in my early twenties and they were nothing like the ones I used to get occasionally. I tried a lot of over the counter drugs and creams but they did not work. I tried sudocream which didn't seem to work in the long run. Eventually, I decided to use Roaccutane. It worked wonders. All my acne cleared up in a few months. The scars started to fade and continue to do so even after I stopped using Roaccutane. In terms of side effects, I did not have any extreme side effects. My hands were very very dry so I had to use a hand cream throughout the day. My body was also dry but it was nothing that I worried about. I would extremely recommend Roaccutane for those who have acne and scarring.	10	December 15, 2020	3
Accutane	Acne	Took Accutane when I was 14. Pretty sure it stunted my growth by closing my growth plates as I stopped growing during my treatment. I still have permanent dry eyes and brain fog and severe depression now 8 years later. It's not worth the gamble, I didn't even have the choice, I was just a kid that followed doctor's orders. Please ask yourself why you would want to give yourself or your loved one an extreme retinoid overdose. It causes widespread damage to the body that is permanent.	1	December 13, 2020	8
Accutane	Acne	I took accutane twice, once when I was 20 years old and again when I was around 35 years old for extremely bad cyst acne that was super painful. This is the only medication that worked, period. Prior I had taken retin-a, ton of antibiotics that hurt my stomach but did nothing for the acne and other drugs. The results from accutane were amazing, during my first month or 2 all my black heads fell out and all of the painful cyst acne stopped. It left me cyst acne free for 10 years until it came back again when I was 35. I started another regiment which cleared it up again I am now 44 and still for the most part acne free. I would take it again in a heart beat. Each time I take it the most severe side effects that occur for me is dry lips and skin, nothing else. This is cleared up with aquaphor skin moisturizer.	9	December 13, 2020	2
Accutane	Acne	I TOOK THIS POISON FOR 6 months and it completely RUINED MY HAIR FOR LIFE it changed my hair texture. I have thinning hair and it won’t grow long anymore. I have an itchy sensation on scalp due to hair loss and it torments me everyday. I can’t even look at myself in the mirror anymore, trust me I’d rather have acne than lose my hair. Now it’s made me more insecure. YOU'RE ROLLING THE DICE BECAUSE NOT EVERYONE GETS THESE SIDE EFFECTS IF ONLY I WOULD HAVE KNOW THIS MEDICATION COULD POTENTIALLY CAUSE BALDING I WOULD NEVER HAVE TAKEN IT. 	1	September 18, 2020	43
Accutane	Acne	There is no doubt this drug Accutane works initially but the long-term side affects and long-term success are definitely questionable. I took accutane for 6 months and yes it cleared my skin completely but at what cost? My skin was pink/red, dry & extremely sensitive to sunlight. 12 months after I came off accutane my acne returned exactly as it was before. Not only that but I now suffer from rosacea, I cannot tan especially on my face, I have a red face all the time & I blush when drinking. I never had severe acne and honestly wish I had never taken this medication as the side-effects are worse than the initial acne. Give it some serious though and please only take if you have severe acne.	2	August 25, 2020	28
Accutane	Acne	I took this horrible drug 35 years ago and still have dry, red eyes.I have virtually no oil left in my skin so wrinkles come quick.I'd give anything to have normal eyes.	3	August 22, 2020	21
Accutane	Acne	DO NOT TOUCH THIS STUFF.   It gets rid of acne but the side effects are HORRENDOUS.  It has given me permanent dry eyes, permanent dry skin, and permanent insomnia.	1	August 21, 2020	16
Accutane	Acne	"I was on Accutane for 6 months at 80mg/day. I finished about 8 months ago and my skin is still very clear. The ""it gets worse before it gets better"" line is very true. My skin was bad for the first three months I was on Accutane but then slowly improved the last three months. My worst side effects were lower back pain, dry skin, and dry eyes. These side effects went away after I finished. I highly recommend taking Accutane. Although it is hard having your skin be bad for a couple months straight, it is definitely worth it. One thing they don't really tell you about is the blood work and pregnancy test you have to do once a month before getting your new packet for that month. This was kind of annoying but if everything checks out in the first couple of months you don't have to keep doing it."	9	August 7, 2020	32
Accutane	Acne	"I've been taking isotretinoin for about 6 weeks now. I'm still in the ""it gets worse before it gets better"" stage, but wow, my dark spots are slowly fading and I can't believe it. I've battled acne for 6 years, 6!!! So you can imagine how bad my dark spots are from the acne. I just want to trust the process. If you are in this stage as well and feel like giving up, DON'T. WE ARE IN THIS TOGETHER!!!"	8	June 15, 2020	145
Accutane	Acne	I find that Accutane is one of the most life changing experiences. Started to notice a huge difference in my skin on month 2. Treatment is very harsh with many side effects. Dry and thin skin, breakouts now and then, very dry eyes. I tried all type of blistex lip balms which did not help. Baseline blueseal works wonders on the lips and even on dry area ok the skin. I apply sun screen everyday with nutraderm lotion to hydrate my skin. I also find that it really helps to have at least 3 litres of water everyday.  I'm currently in the middle of month 3 of treatment and the past few weeks have been the hardest. Skin and lips is dryer than ever and loss of hair. Some days depression kicks in so it is important to keep your loved ones around you just to have some positivity.  This treatment is quite costly but it is all worth it at the end. A few months of side effects and praying the price for a life long great skin and confident you.	10	June 10, 2020	40
Accutane	Acne	If you have tried everything else and failed, then Accutane is the way to go. It never fails. Of course some will need a higher dosage than others or longer period of time depending on how bad the acne is. I was on a one pill per day option for 4 months. Within 2 months most of my pimples had cleared and only had spots. I was happy. But the side effects are also not very pretty. But I think it is a small price to pay for clearer skin forever. I had really dry lips. Had to drink water all the time. I actually used to sleep with a bottle and some vaseline to use during night. My whole body was extremely dry including my private parts. Had small nosebleeds. But I'd try to put vaseline with an earbud in my nose to avoid drying up. My face was very sensitive. I was lucky all this happened during lockdown so I was in the house for quite some time. In my third to fourth month every side effect became worse.	9	June 2, 2020	27
Accutane	Acne	I’m excited that I finally joined this party. I was cycling through antibiotics and retin-a/adapelene for all of high school and college and it was fairly ineffective and miserable. I came to accept myself in college and for awhile I thought it was immoral/dangerous to risk accutane because I had depression in high school. However, over the years I learned that several of my classmates and my own cousin had taken it and look normal. When I started my first job while living at home right after college I decided it was time to roll the dice with accutane. I’m in a special category of people because I decided that I was willing to own the risk just for the chance to try this drug and see if it opens some doors for me. I also wanted the assurance that this was something I could recommend to my future child. In terms of symptoms I got the dryness, a few nosebleeds, joint pain, itchiness, hazy eyesight, peeling skin and I took 60 mg a day for 6 months.	5	May 31, 2020	14
Accutane	Acne	I am on 10mg oratane dose, one pill a day. I had very oily skin, mild pimples that would break out every third week and lots of blackhead which are gone and skin no longer oily. I am happy with the results so far in my second month now. The negative part about taking the meds is the side effects, sore joints, dry eyes and nose, very thin skin and the worst it has to be my lips, chapped, red, dry and extremely sore I even thought of quitting the meds.	7	May 3, 2020	33
Accutane	Acne	Life saving!	10	May 2, 2020	10
Accutane	Acne	"THIS DRUG IS POISON. PLEASE CARE FOR YOURSELF. Accutane ruined my life. I took 80mg of Accutane for 9 months @ 18 yrs old. I has cystic acne on my back & face. I tried birth control, antibiotics, & topical creams. So my derm recommended this. Side effects: dry skin all over, chapped lips, eczema, brittle nails. Vision problems, waking up in morning with my eyes sealed shut with pus, and dry eyes. Lips were a huge scab. Normal & monthly checkups/blood tests. I had dime sized blisters on my body from a sunburn. 6 months: body aches that made it difficult to sleep, poor digestion, hemorrhoids, bloody stools, & sad.  Months 7-9: MY HAIR FELL OUT. I lost 80% of my hair, in pain & depressed. 9 months : finished treatment, I was ""cured"" of my acne. I was bald, poor vision & in pain mentally and physically. 3 months, my acne came back WORSE. My derm said to do round 2 of accutane & I told her never to recommend it to anyone. It is SO TOXIC for your body. Please do not take this drug."	1	April 7, 2020	87
Accutane	Acne	The only drug that worked for my severe cystic acne. I had tried so many other topical ointments, antibiotics, and facial washes before finally trying this drug as a last resort. 8 years later, and my skin is still extremely clear. I was on this drug for a total of 8 months and had side effects such as constipation in the beginning, some occasional joint pain when I would lie down or get up, a few styes, and VERY severe, frequent nosebleeds that were very annoying. I wouldn’t recommend trying this medication if you haven’t been on anything else before yet for cystic acne, but if you’ve already tried everything and you’re at the end of your rope, try it! It even worked for the body acne I had on my back. The severe, permanent lasting side effects are usually very rare and it’s more than worth the risk if your skin is really suffering.	10	April 7, 2020	28
Accutane	Acne	I had bad skin from the age of around 10. By the time I was 12-13 I had full blown acne and already had scarring all over my skin. I got prescribed a lot of treatments before accutane as I was so young. I was prescribed creams, the mini-pill and a couple of other tablets which did nothing for my skin. Any cream would burn my skin. My aunt suggested Accutane. I had a few side affects from the tablets but not much result. But on month 4 I would say, I saw my skin start to clear up quite quickly, but my emotional state started to deteriorate. I suffered with mild anxiety and depression. 8 months later and my skin was amazing. I got constant compliments about how much better my skin was. I stopped the tablets in October, and unfortunately my skin has started to go back to its old ways, so I’m disappointed about that. I think a longer treatment may have benefited me. I would definitely recommend this for anyone suffering like I was. It’s worth it :)	9	April 7, 2020	22
Accutane	Acne	I took this 20 years ago for awful acne that I had fought from nearly 13 to 20 years old.  I was terrified to take it, but I had tried every option.  It cleared me up completely.  I had minimal side effects and MUCH higher self esteem finally.  I finally felt attractive and I honestly think , had I taken it sooner, my life would be different in some ways.  My son is now taking it for the awful, cystic acne I've passed down to him!  The dryness bothers him some, and at 2 months in he's not seeing the difference he wants, but I'm telling him to push through.	10	February 28, 2020	35
Accutane	Acne	I'm almost finished with my third month of Accutane. I started taking Accutane due to severe body acne (chest, back, neck, arms, etc). I first attempted doxy and topical lotion but it did not seem to help. Therefore my dermatologist recommended Accutane. I started out at 40mg in the first month and am now on 80mg during my third month. The first month was not bad with side effects at all. I simply noticed dry lips and a bit more dryness on my body. Month two was not too bad either, some headaches, and more dryness on the lips and body. Month three is when some of the emotional instability kicked in. I have been experiencing some anxiety and depression, but it's been manageable. The irritation and more anger has been the worst emotional side effects. I've also noticed thinning of the skin, more easily to injure and more noticeable veins. Over all I still believe taking accutane has been worth it. Yes, the side effects suck, especially in winter, but I'm so glad my acne is gone.	7	February 24, 2020	22
Accutane	Acne	About over two years ago I started my accutane treatment, I was 15, on a low dose with acne surrounding my mouth and my forehead which is generally known as the T-Zone. As I began the treatment, my skin inflamed and had an intense breakout which lasted about 2 months which had managed to get rid of all the acne and all I was left with was dark hyperpigmentation spots. However as the months continued in my treatment, I began to develop cystic acne around my shoulder and back, so bad in fact that they would burst and bleed causing agonising pain for the best part of 3 months. These cysts would later leave me keloid scars I still have to this day. However after my course, it seemed to be too good to be true, for about a year and a half I was clean, enjoying my life, until 6 months ago when I began to develop acne again around my cheeks, jawline and back of my neck. To me now, depressed and full of pain,  I would have never have took it if I knew what would have happened to me now.	5	February 23, 2020	18
Accutane	Acne	I promised myself that if this worked, then I would write a review to hopefully help other patients out who are hesitant about taking Accutane. I have been taking Accutane (40 mg/day) for 4 months now. I am 5'5 and 138 pounds. I can say that Accutane *works* better than any other acne medication (the other medication I tried was Spiro, which helped my face acne by like 75% but did nothing for my back/chest acne). I have tried and I had minimal side effects (dry skin, some fatigue, increased sun sensitivity, dry lips, dry eyes) but that is all. It was all worth it though. It not only got rid of my cystic acne but also got rid of my closed comedones and the sebaceous filaments on my nose. My ONLY regret is not taking this sooner. If you have pitted scarring or your skin scars easily, please take this. I have nothing but positive things to say about Accutane.	10	February 12, 2020	79
Accutane	Acne	I posted previously about this drug making my hormonal acne much much worse. It then made my skin so dry I looked aged by about 15 years. it gave me a lot of blurred vision which turned out to be due to extremely dry eye, and it continued to worsen my acne until I finally discontinued it 3 weeks ago. My skin has improved so much since coming off it but I now have a lot of red marks left from all the spots I had while taking it and so far my acne is still worse than it was before I began treatment - but I’m just pleased it’s improved compared to how it was looking a couple of months ago because I was crying a lot over how bad it had made it. My eyes are still very dry but have improved.	1	February 11, 2020	17
Accutane	Acne	I have had acne since I was a teen. I am now 37. I have tried minocycline, expensive acne products, etc. Nothing ever worked. In your thirties with acne is pretty embarrassing. Also I’d cover it up with makeup and then that looks worse! I went to a dermatologist and she recommended accutane. I AM SO THANKFUL!!! My skin has never been clearer! I get compliments all the time from people who have known me. No side effects here :)	10	February 7, 2020	66
Accutane	Acne	I have struggled with acne my entire life, tried countless of drugs and products to clear my skin, and had no luck.   When I was on Accutane, I had clear skin aside from a few cystic pimples throughout the two year period. In addition to this amazing feeling, my skin was constantly dry, my lips were constantly chapped, and I had to drink many cups a water of day to even feel semi-hydrated.   When I stopped taking the drug, I suffered from hardcore anxiety and had a few full blown anxiety attacks, something I have never been affected by before I started taking this medication. After about a month or two, this anxiety calmed but I still suffer from it.  Now, almost four years after I finished taking the medication, my acne is back and the same as before, my lips are still constantly chapped, I still wake up in the middle of the night to very dry skin, and my hair is way thinner than it used to be. This harmful drug is NOT WORTH IT.	2	January 30, 2020	23
Accutane	Acne	My experience on this has been on the whole very good I had suffered with persistent acne that no other drug would even make a dent on. I was also training near 7x a week so was very unsure of the effects accutane would have on my body and was in two minds of taking it. I'm currently 4 months in and do not regret it in the slightest. I have maybe 1 minor spot every 2 weeks that disappears in a day and my oily skin has completely died down. The main side effects I experienced were dry lips (always have Vaseline on you), Joint pain, especially with heavy lifting and bending down. Also a very dry nose. If you are going to drink on this, your limit will be severely reduced, 2 pints and you will be utterly wasted, and with some people, 1 pint will be the end. What I would recommend: In the UK doctors tell us to take 1 tablet daily for 2 weeks to see how badly it effects us, up it to 2 tablets a day (40mg) and go from there. This way your body isn't suddenly hit with a very potent drug	9	January 25, 2020	17
Accutane	Acne	Honestly I came into this drug thinking it would be really awful but it has been easy as. My acne was never severe in the first place but I did have stubborn pimples. I’m on month 3 and my lips aren’t chapped at all (thank goodness) and my skin isn't dry either. Only side effect is back pain which is tolerable!!! The second I start to feel the aquaphor on my lips go away I apply it again (which is why my lips aren’t dry, they don’t get a chance to get dry). If ur thinking about taking this DO IT. It’s not as bad as people make it seem to be	10	January 25, 2020	55
Accutane	Acne	Yes, the side effects stink, but when you see your blemish free face in the mirror it is so worth it. Keep your health in mind and keep chapstick on you while you’re on this drug.	10	January 23, 2020	23
Accutane	Acne	Taking Accutane for my acne is one of the best things I’ve done. It has literally changed my life and I have become so much more confident. I am so much happier with how my skin is and my appearance now than I ever have been. People comment on how I look happier and healthier because my skin is just glowing! I am just in my last month or so and I am looking forward to when it finishes. I struggled with severely dry lips and patches of skin on my face to begin with. My skin started to cope more but my lips are still as dry as ever, this is something I will not miss. Occasionally I may feel down however as long as you tell your doctor the truth they can deal with this and possibly lower your dose etc. (one of the positive side effects is my hair is no where near as greasy!) To anyone who is wondering whether Accutane is for them, I would say it is life changing and the side effects are manageable for such a positive outcome at the end!	10	January 22, 2020	23
Accutane	Acne	Accutane completely sucks.  It made everything for me 50 x worse. If your acne isn’t severe, don’t take it. Because there is a chance that it will get worse like it did for me. Side effects suck to	1	January 14, 2020	18
Accutane	Acne	Complete garbage.  Took it for antibiotic resistant moderate acne along the jawline.  60 mg a day for 3 months, escalated dose to 90mg a day for the 4th month as a 68kg male.  Still ZERO RESULTS as of the end of month 4.  If there is any improvement in month 5 it is too late and too little of what I wanted.	1	January 11, 2020	9
Accutane	Acne	Accutane was overall a horrible experience. The first month went perfectly smoothly. I experienced dryness and chapped lips as usual. When my dosage increased during the second month, things got worse. Acne was starting to slowly improve, but my liver experienced extremely increased enzymes. While on this medicine, I avoided drinking alcohol. I took every precaution to be healthy. It just didn’t work and I had to stop. Now I still have elevated liver enzymes and I have to see a physician. This medicine affects everyone differently, and you must know that going in. Definitely a last resort medicine, as it works for people but hurts others.	2	January 9, 2020	15
Accutane	Acne	Yes, there is some dryness and sensitivity, I applied various lip products hourly, and I found myself putting vaseline up my nose.  But, I've been dealing with cystic acne since high school (I'm now 37), and my skin is finally clear and smooth.	9	January 8, 2020	20
Accutane	Acne	I started the medication a little under 3 months ago. My acne wasn’t as bad as most people have it. I would get 1-3 cystic breakouts about every week. I also had pretty oily skin which is mainly what caused these breakouts. One week on the medication, my skins oil decreased substantially. Week 2 came around and I had probably the worst breakout I’ve had in recent memory. It took about a week and a half for my skin to heal from that but I haven’t had any breakouts since. I haven’t even had tiny pimples or anything like that as well. Accutane has made my skin so much better and I couldn’t be happier with the results. The side affects aren’t anything to worry about either. The only side affects I’ve gotten were dry skin, chapped lips, and red hands (my derma gave me a cream for my hands and they were fine a week later). With all of this said, I would highly recommend accutane, although the side affects seem scary, I have only gotten the dryness.	10	January 3, 2020	22
Accutane	Rosacea	I went on accutane for rosacea after about 3-5 years of trying antibiotics and metronidazole and any other prescription or OTC cream or health care remedy that I could find.  I ended up with an allergy to one antibiotic and having 2 other antibiotics that no longer work for me.  I’ve spent hundreds of dollars on scams that I prayed would work and did nothing.  The damage to your self esteem is incredible, walking around with pimples the size of Texas that have 5 to 8 heads and feeling like hiding in a closet all day.   Accutane was a life changer!  I started with 1 pill a day, then down to every second day and then stayed for years on 1 pill every 5 days.  I went from almost constant breakouts to none and it has also helped with reducing the redness as well. I’ve been off accutane now for a month, but I will go back on in a heartbeat if I break out again. I’ve never had a single side effect, and feel that the plus side of using accutane far outweighs the negative.	10	December 30, 2019	24
Accutane	Acne	I would give this medicine a 10/10 because of how effective it is. The only thing that brings it down a few points is because I really did see a big effect on how my body reacted to it. I experienced the usual dry skin symptoms but also experienced headaches and chest pains throughout my duration on it which made it really unenjoyable for the months I was on it.	8	December 25, 2019	9
Accutane	Acne	I started getting acne when I was 13 when I first got my period. At first it wasn't that bad I would have white heads that wouldn't come back after I popped them. Then it started to get bad when I was 15 to the point where it would leave dark marks ( hyperpigmentation).  I used Cetaphil which burned my skin and made my acne worse. So we went to the dermatologist and decided that it would be best to go on Accutane. I'm 3 months in now and my skin looks good. Before I would get this deep pimples that would be very painful and leave huge marks. But there are side effects that you should be aware of which are nosebleeds, possibly depression, dry eyes, and dry skin. And the monthly pregnancy test ( if you're a woman) and blood tests. To moisturize your skin I would recommend CeraVe facial cleanser ( it has hyaluronic acid which hydrates the skin), isdin micellar solution, Vanicream lite lotion, and round cotton pads.	8	December 25, 2019	18
Accutane	Acne	previously I had a serious acne problem. I even went to appointment to have facial treatment to wash my face and they helped me to squeeze all the blackhead and acne pop out most of it on my face. After the treatment few days or weeks later as a result caused my face full of redness and acne scars. After that incident, I am no longer went to have facial treatment but I still continue to try other products from pharmacy to wash my face after shower all by myself. In the meantime, acne still occur but I still live a normal life. After few years later, a friend of my introduce me to visit this dermatologist and he gave me this product called Accutane its a 10mg, oral taken once a day. 1-3months later can really see the results, my acne started to clear and scars may take longer but still improving.  While taking, it has certain side effects such as dry lips and you might feel thirsty so I guess this capsule is powerful but it also not good to take long term.	9	December 18, 2019	16
Accutane	Acne	My son took accutane for his acne, the acne stopped for a while but the medication sucked all the oils from his face and left him with terrible scars.  I do NOT recommend anyone to take Accutane.  don't do it!!		December 16, 2019	8
Accutane	Acne	My back and abdomen acne became severe in the last year when I started receiving testosterone replacement therapy.  After 6 months of  accutane treatment my back and chest is 99% clear. From a cosmetic point of view I am delighted. HOWEVER! Yes I had dry lips, skin and nostrils. Some days/weeks I would get incredibly low. I know we all get down at times but this was a much lower, persistent feeling. In addition I started getting massive lymph node swellings in my arm pits, on my stomach. I had to go to the doctor on two separate occasions because of the size and pain of the swellings. My doctor noticed I was clearly depressed. She recommended coming off Accutane but my stubbornness made me persist. I observed noticeable improvement on my skin after 3 months. It was probably only in the last month when I stopped getting acne completely. However be careful of your mental health. The medication changed my personality and I became very anxious, deeply depressed and tired.	7	December 16, 2019	19
Accutane	Acne	Since I was 12 I have been dealing with acne and my parents spent so much money and time on treatments and nothing worked these past 5 years. So we decided accutane was the only route. This is my 3rd month on accutane and I will say that during this time my face has broke out around 10 times as much as usual (no exaggeration). But then they put me on prednisone and my face cleared up drastically for a couple weeks then when I got off it just broke back out. It has dropped my confidence so far down and I just avoid looking people in the eye or showing myself in pictures. My lips are extremely dry and I’ve experienced some minor rash like bumps on my arms and hands this is getting out of hand but it’s only 3 months in so I think this can work.	7	December 15, 2019	11
Accutane	Acne	I have hormonal acne caused by having a Mirena IUD inserted. I had perfect skin before Mirena, I’m 25, never had acne, 1 occasional spot here & there as a teen, nothing else. Mirena caused deep spots mostly on jawline - not many. Dr was very quick to move to roaccutane after trying 1 antibiotic that didn’t work, he didn’t advise me to remove Mirena which I now think I should have. I’m on 40mg & weigh 46kg. 2 weeks after I started roaccutane my whole face started breaking out, places I’ve never had spots before. I have been on it 2.5 months now & its still 1000x worse than before I began treatment & every single spot I’ve had so far has left hyperpigmentation. The spots are smaller now than they were after the 1st month of treatment but I have SO MANY more of them than I did after the 1st month that I’m not even sure if this is an improvement. I really regret taking it & feel I was poorly advised by dr. Worried my skin will be ruined forever. I will be left with scars.	1	December 11, 2019	14
Accutane	Acne	For people who are thinking of taking it and are worried, I wanted to share that I'm luckily enough to have NOT experienced half these effects so you may not get them yourself! I went through private health and first dosage was 30mg, then 40mg and currently I'm on month 3 at 60mg. I could see that my skin immediately started the clear up but since then, the results have stagnated a little and haven't noticed much change. Side effect wise, I get really dry lips and its a bit dry inside my nostrils...But that's it! No headaches or anxiety, no aching joints (still go to the gym 3-5 days a week), haven't noticed any particularly bad breakouts (just not clearing up) and had slightly sensitive skin on my face in month 2. I do have mild eczema anyway but it definitely hasn't made it worse. And one thing that's great whilst you are on it, you never get greasy hair! So if acne is really effecting you, go for it. For me, it's worth the side effects.	8	December 1, 2019	23
Accutane	Acne	I am currently a week into my third month of treatment And have suffered from acne since the age of 19 I am now 24 and have finally decided to bite the bullet and go on accutane My derm initially prescribed me 40mg of accutane once daily she upped my dose to 60mg and when I say my skin has become beyond dry and sensitive to the touch I mean it Not to mention the initial purge is something  am dealing, with breaking out on parts of my face that I normally don’t breakout.  There are red inflamed bumps that take weeks to dissipate. At my last appointment she lowered my dose back to 40mg She stated that I am just one of the patients of hers that she needs to ease into the process with I was on prednisone during month two as well because my skin had flared up so bad. I am really hoping there is a light at the end of this nightmare of a tunnel. If anyone has gone through anything similar to this with their treatment I would love to hear your experience because I’m losing hope and am trying to be patient	6	November 23, 2019	23
Accutane	Acne	"I have hormonal cystic acne in part caused by birth control. I've had acne for 18 years, which turned cystic 5 years ago when I started birth control to deal with a heavy period. The only birth control that worked, was a disaster for my skin. Every morning I would wake up with a new pimple. So now I've been on accutane for about 4 months so far. Within the first month, my skin never looked better. I stopped getting cyst like pimples and white heads every day. I'm on the 60mg dose and barely experienced any side effects. My lips are not a mess, and overall I just feel ""winter dry"". As for my acne now, I still get a cluster of pimples but they show up every week, if that, instead of every day. Progress! So if medications usually don't work for you, or you are not responding to accutane like everyone else, you are not alone."	7	November 23, 2019	9
Accutane	Acne	I've had acne for 6 years. I’ve been on Accutane for 6 months now, first I was taking 20mg, my skin got so bad to start with, then went back to how it was before I started my course. Now I am on 40mg and still no improvement. As for side effects, I have bleeding lips every day, flakey scalp, joint pain (I cannot exercise it hurts my knees too much), I am incredibly moody, also very depressed for no apparent reason (besides having acne), I have an irregular heart beat, fatigue...Hopefully after a few more months my skin will get clearer.	5	November 10, 2019	15
Accutane	Acne	I was on accutane for about 13 months. My skin had a horrible purging time, it is completely normal for your skin to get worse before it gets better, my skin did not clear up until the 11-12 months on it. My dermatologist was giving me the wrong doses, and kept moving me up and down doses, which is not normal. After treatment my skin was completely clear. For about 6 months. I recently got horrible cystic acne back, it is so painful. I went to a different dermatologist and I am on my second course of accutane starting at 60 mg a day. It is supposed to be around 6 month treatment, hopefully it stays clear this time!		November 10, 2019	13
Accutane	Acne	I struggled with cystic acne and oily skin since my teens.  I was on accutane in my early 20’s and it worked.  17 years later I still haven't outgrown it so I decided to go on it again.  6 months 40MG every other day.  Other than the dry lips, dry and sore joints, and maybe some low moods, my skin cleared up after 4 months.  I'm now off it, and still bracing myself for the next break out.  I don't regret it and glad I did it.  I recommend using cetaphil for washing and heavy cream (vaseline) at night to alleviate the dry skin.  The dryness only lasted first 2 months out the 6 months.  Good luck!	9	November 9, 2019	13
Accutane	Acne	I have tried every acne product on the market. Proactive included. Nothing cured my cystic acne except accutane. It truly is a miracle drug, albeit with side effects. My acne started to come back after a few years, so I am on a 2nd round, which will be much shorter. I am a 37 yo female and have battled facial acne since puberty.	10	November 7, 2019	17
Accutane	Rosacea	I posted on here after 3 weeks of taking Oratane saying I was too scared to keep trying - but I did end up persevering.  Really glad I did. Been 4 months. Take one 20mg every 4 days & my rosacea is gone. No rash. No flushing. Gone!!  Now I'm too scared to stop taking it.....	8	November 6, 2019	18
Accutane	Acne	I am currently on this for the second cycle I did a 5 month treatment in 2018 and on it again because after I was off it started coming back. It is distressing at 25 years old and seeing girls with clear faces and me I'm still dealing with acne and stressing over it.  I am doing it all over again I'm on the 3rd week of taking the pills and I'm breaking out really bad but all I get is super dry lips, my moods do change but I try and maintain. Hopefully my acne does clear up and is the last cycle I have to do but I asked the nurse how many time can someone do this and they said  as many times as you need so  I am guessing acne does come back for some of us which sucks.	6	November 6, 2019	12
Accutane	Acne	In high school I had horrible painful cystic acne. I took accutane from the fall of 2015 to spring of 2016. While taking it I experienced extreme dryness, chapped lips, joint pain, and had problems with my eyesight at night (drug causes eye shape to change). When the course was completed my skin was perfect. A few months after being off accutane I developed severe anxiety, had panic attacks everyday, and depression. My skin stayed pretty much clear for 3 years but now my cystic acne has come back, although not as bad as before. I don’t plan on doing another round of accutane because the long term side effects aren’t worth it. FOR THOSE THINKING ABOUT TAKING THIS PLEASE KNOW ITS AT A COST. I truly cannot see in dark or dimly lit rooms, I have no night vision. I know at least 5 other people who’ve taken this drug that have also experienced depression AND anxiety after taking it. My mind is constantly in a fog and I can’t memorize anything anymore.	5	November 4, 2019	16
Accutane	Acne	I had my first round of accutane when I was 14. The doctor put me on only 20mg because I was young so I was on the drug for 13 months. It cleared up my cystic acne like magic and not a ton of side effects except for dry skin, nose bleeds. About 2 years after I started to get my cysts on my skin especially on my back, neck and jawline and I am now currently on another round of accutane but this time 40mg taken every other day. Fingers crossed it works this time!	7	November 3, 2019	10
Accutane	Acne	I was on this medicine Accutane for a bit but had to stop right before I got my second blood test for it. I had a non stop terrible headache the entire time I was on it; my skin was so dry and my mental health went straight down the drain. My mental health wasn't at its worst when I started taking it, but it wasn't at it's greatest either; so it could be different for someone who has excellent mental health. During the time I was on it, I was super depressed and angry all the time and without even realizing it. I kept snapping at everyone; which is pretty out of the norm since I usually keep those emotions to myself. I stopped taking it cause I literally thought i would die from the head pain or because of how badly it effected my mental health. My skin got worse during the time I was on it.	1	November 1, 2019	7
Accutane	Acne	I’ve definitely heard of lots of people who love the medication Accutane as it’s worked wonders for their skin. Unfortunately with my experience, all I got was the negative side effects, including dry red skin, chapped lips, nose bleeds, and the worse side effect of all was that  I got super bad depression from the drug. Sadly the medication also made my acne so much worse then it already was. After three months my skin looked terrible, I have swings of depression, and my lips were always in pain. I decided to quit the medication and go on back on (doxycycline) a medication which I was previously on before Accutane. After making this switch my skin and lips healed 100% and my side effects were gone.   Just thought I would write this review to let people know Accutane doesn’t work for all people. In certain cases it can make your skin worse.	1	October 23, 2019	16
Accutane	Acne	i have bad closed comendones all over my face. A LOT of them. I first tried Retin A cream & tried tazorac didn't work I brought up accutane to my new derm & told me it would go away on 6 month course. I started 40mg a day and had bad headaches the first couple weeks but it stopped.  The side effects of dry skin isn't too bad I had oily skin prior so no oil now - the dry lips suck! My corners crack & always peeling. I finished month 2 a few weeks ago. I do believe in purging process. I never had red bumps often up until last week they are coming up about everyday. I have found 1 other person on the internet with this issue .You can not just cover these with makeup. the wrong lighting can make them look 100x worse & you should not pick at your face while on it. Your skin is highly sensitive & it will be red for weeks or leave scarring. But I never had depression & don't really have it now other than getting upset about my face not clearing.  Symptom wise is good right now. Hope to update with a clear face in a few months.	5	October 21, 2019	10
Accutane	Acne	Do NOT take this drug for mild acne! I wanted it to get rid of my blackheads and it did that, but it did a lot more harm than good. It gave me rosacea and tissue paper thin skin that turns red at the slightest touch or movement. I cannot eat anything that requires chewing or my face turns bright red. Plus there’s burning and pain. Also, the skin on my face just looks dry and damaged now no matter how much moisturizer I put on. This was a terrible, terrible mistake.	1	October 16, 2019	9
Accutane	Acne	I have been on Accutane now for 3 months. I was started on 30mg by my dermatologist -  may I say they  have been so so helpful and supportive. Within 3-4 weeks my acne was SEVERE, it was so painful I couldn’t sleep on it or even touch it. With weekly visits to my dermatologist, she suggested comedo extraction, I had this done twice, still no improvement. I then was dropped to 20mg a day but that still did not assist the extreme acne which Accutane caused! I did not go on Accutane with acne this severe, if I knew this would happen, I would never have started it. I am now on my third month and only take 10mg daily as advised by my dermatologist. Unfortunately still no improvement and I feel this is not normal. All the reviews I read state by month 3 I should be seeing improvements and should be on a higher dosage! Can anyone give me advice, e.g. was yours the same? Or did you go through the same experience? I really don’t want to give up on Accutane!		October 13, 2019	24
Accutane	Acne	I had cystic acne for a while and it was honestly just the worst. I hated taking any kinds of pictures and showing my face anywhere. Besides that, it was just plain out painful! I went to my dermatologist and she started me on Accutane. It took about 2-3 months before I started seeing significant differences, but after that it just kept getting better. All of my acne is completely gone now and you can’t see any scarring. I do have some freckles so it covers up whatever little dots are left behind from permanent scarring but there are barely any anyways. The only real problems I had was dry lips and scalp. I made sure to always have chapstick on me and I went through many a hair mask, but I have no other complaints. With that, I know people have some emotional problems but I can say I had none, although I was way more confident with my appearance. I was very very skeptical at first with all the crazy side affects, but I can say I am so grateful I did it!	10	October 10, 2019	31
Accutane	Acne	Our son started struggling with acne around age of 12 and we tried everything over the counter and things just weren't improving.   When he was 13 we started seeing a dermatologist, I did not want to try Accutane. I was worried about side affects. We continued to see the dermatologist and continue treatment but never did get on the Accutane until about a year later when he turned 14. His acne was  getting so bad that his skin was starting to show some minor pitting and he didn't want to take off his shirt. Because of the acne all over his chest and back. After four months we started seeing improvement and he was off of it at the eighth month.   It has been over a year since he completed his treatment and he is still acne free! The side effects that he experienced were extremely dry skin and he was very moody during hus eight months of treatment! All this being said it was well worth it for him!  I am so thankful that we took this medicine.	10	October 6, 2019	33
Accutane	Rosacea	I have been on this drug about four times in my life. In my 20s I went on it twice for mild to moderate acne that made me acne free with perfect skin for 20 years. Now in my 40s I went on it twice for papulopustular rosacea.  it was a total cure and leads to stunning skin. It also acts as a wrinkle eraser which is something that the media is too afraid to talk about publicly. This drug is highly recommended. Yes it dries your lips so what. If you want perfect skin it’s worth it	10	October 5, 2019	26
Accutane	Acne	I’m on round 2 of Accutane. The first time I took it I didn’t have a ton of side effects (Dry skin around lips and nose) and was very pleased with the results. 6 years later my acne is back in full force. I’m super upset and depressed about it and not happy with doing 6 more months of blood work and doctors visits (especially with useless insurance that won’t cover it). Hoping this is the last time in my life I have to do this. I’m almost 40 years old and sick of this battle!		October 3, 2019	16
Accutane	Acne	Accutane is the only thing that actually worked. Wear sunscreen and don't drink too much. Drink a lot of water. My skin actually freaking cleared up, dry skin is not that hard to deal with	10	October 2, 2019	18
Accutane	Acne	"I suffered from acne for years and finally was at a point where I was fed up and my only option was to take Accutane. I was so excited to start despite all the side effects and got so encouraged when I heard about everyone else's positive experiences. A week into 40 mg on Claravis not much happened until a couple days after I no longer had oily skin and my lips were chapped. Exactly 14 days into this drug was when things started to take a turn. I started to experience tightness in my chest but during that time didn't think that much of it. The next day it was worse and I was having shortness of breath and had to take at least 10 breaths before I could breathe. That next morning I fainted in my bathroom and was taken to the hospital later that day to get checked and apparently everything was ""normal"". I obviously had to stop it which sucked but at this point the risks outweighed the benefits. Please think before you go on Accutane especially since everyone reacts to it differently."	2	September 27, 2019	16
Accutane	Acne	Accutane completely cured my acne for 6 months  but then acne comes back progessively after taking the drug. I have now taken it twice (Two 6 month courses of very strong doses). Now waiting for my 3rd referal to a dermatologist after 9 years of acne and really losing hope.	6	September 27, 2019	6
Accutane	Acne	Did a year of accutane it gave me seizures. It did not clear my acne. My skin looked so bad while I was on this drug. It would crack, my lips would crack. I'm on aczone now. I still break out weekly not as bad as before. I've given up on clear skin.	1	September 25, 2019	3
Accutane	Acne	Do NOT take this unless you have very severe cystic acne. I was heavily pressured into taking this 6 months ago with moderate acne and I can't stress enough how much I regret it.  I was urged by a dermatologist to start this before my acne might get really bad. Instead of stopping it, though, I had 6 months of unfixably chapped lips, dry skin, severe depression, and exponentially worse acne. My entire face and neck would break out far worse than ever before.  My acne is now severe and every single pimple has stuck around as a scar. My face and neck are covered with scars and after what has easily been the worst half a year of my entire life, I look 100 times worse.  If you only have moderate acne (i.e. you get some breakouts but it disappears over a relatively short period) then please avoid this. Do NOT allow a doctor to pressure you into this. It took me from somewhat bad to severely bad acne. You will have all of the negative side effects with none of the positive ones.	1	September 25, 2019	23
Accutane	Acne	I really struggled with Acne in my teens and my twenties, Roaccutane at 27 I took the plunge. I read all the side effects I was due to be on Roaccutane for 4 months but I ended up on it for 6-7 months. Nothing can prepare you for the dry lips and skin. After about 7 days on the treatment my acne just went crazy I was developing 10 new spots an hour, they were coming out so fast my face was now full with more spot than ever, but I had prepared myself for it, the medication was starting to take affect. It was hard being on the medication with dry lips and skin but a small price to pay for good skin. In the last month of the treatment my skin improved 100% people would comment on how clear my skin was. But then about 3 month after I would get the odd spot, but since then I apply a little Duac gel from the doctor once or twice a week and it keeps my skin clear. I am now 39 and my skin is good it has changed my life for the better.	10	August 26, 2019	30
Accutane	Acne	I struggled with a lot of small acne and redness on my face. The doctors diagnosed me with Keratosis pilaris (KP) on my face, arms, and shoulders (which is not curable). I tried many topicals and home remedies, they all made my face more red and left me feeling helpless. Accutane was my last resort, and mark my words, I wish it were my first. Everything, and I mean everything is gone. No more redness, no more bumps on my face arms or shoulders. Dermatologists just say things sometimes, maybe I didn’t even have KP. This drug works wonders, took me until my senior year to finally use it. Don’t waste your time with acne when you can have beautiful skin. Use this treatment!	10	August 24, 2019	25
Accutane	Acne	I went through the ups and downs of Accutane so I know the fears of starting this medication with the concoction of good, bad and terrible reviews out there. I give it a 9/10	9	August 23, 2019	17
Accutane	Acne	So I as many of everyone else here have struggled with severe cystic acne on my face since I was in middle school and a lot of redness. I went to a derm and they prescribed a lot of antibiotics like minocycline, doxycycline, and bactrim all of which did not work. Finally I was prescribed accutane and it has worked pretty well. Although, I am on my 6th month and I do still have scarring and smaller pimples still come. As far as side effects, I get the usual dryness on lips and face, but it isn’t terrible where I can’t handle it. Also I run, and I do get knee and hip pain sometimes, but I could still lower through it. I give it a 7/10 because it did significantly clear my face , but did not get rid of all my acne and scarring.	7	August 16, 2019	9
Accutane	Acne	Hey all, I am currently coming up on my 13th month of accutane. I was supposed to be done with this medication around month 7 like my dermo have predicted. My dermo from month 7 said that my skin looked great and I had not had any breakouts and yet my dermo continued to keep me on accutane for another 5 months. My skin was clear and I was feeling great but it was a hassle to take 60- 80 mg of accutane everyday. Coming up on this month my acne has gotten SO much worse! I’m breaking out, my face is SO red and my skin is SO dry. I think that my dermo has been keeping me on accutane for too long and the side effects are catching up to me ?! ALSO, if you are debating wether or not to take this I would suggest to take it. You just need to be aware of the side effects and how severe they can be. If you are willing to wake up with dry, cracked, bleeding lips and be in pain for clear skin I would suggest accutane.	8	August 11, 2019	5
Accutane	Rosacea	Have Rosacea since my early 20s. After 10 years of my doctor acting like I was complaining about nothing I eventually went to a skin specialist who prescribed Rosex. Symptom free for 12 years - when it stopped working. Tried Soolantra, Muravaso, oral antibiotics it was time for Accutane.  My Rosacea  affects my nose. Very oily skin, occassional spots. general redness and flushing  I'm one week in - no side effects. I'm on day 7. The 'gets worse before it gets better' thing hasn't happened yet.  Flushing is 70% better. Spots have eased right back - by 70%. General redness down maybe 50%. Oiliness maybe 20% improvement so far.  I put off going on this medication out of concern about side-effects. I'm glad I went ahead - Rosacea is a nightmare that was literally ruining my life. I was desperate. Hope the improvements continue.	8	August 7, 2019	34
Accutane	Acne	AMAZING results!!! I had bad cystic acne for 5 years.Tried antibiotics, retin-A cream, diets and the only thing that worked was accutane. I still have scaring but at least it's healing (finished accutane 2 months ago). I would recommend it but do your research, it can cause serious side affects. Fortunately, I just had the usual dry lips, dry nose and skin, and it went away when I stopped taking the pills.	10	July 24, 2019	12
Accutane	Rosacea	My rosacea got progressively worse in my late twenties. After seeing several different dermatologists and trying various medications and topical treatments accutane is the only thing that has worked for me. I started on taking 20mg daily and after approx 4 months gradually reduced to 20mg every 3/4 days. I now hardly ever get any spots at all and my skin condition is 100x better! I know it comes with risks but it has truly been life changing for me personally so far outweighs the other risks. Reducing stress was also a major reducing factor I believe. Although it’s hard not to be in the vicious cycle of stress when you check your face 1000 times a day!  I used to spend hours and hours looking at this forum and across the Internet in desperation looking for something that might work and some reassurance from others that I’m not the only one battling this miserable condition. I just hope this helps anyone know they’re not alone!	10	July 23, 2019	47
Accutane	Acne	For the most part had a good experience on Accutane. Started getting bad body acne (mostly back, some chest) around 14-15 and it cleared up by 16. Then it starting happening to my face and was consistently very bad for a couple years. Literally tried everything dermatologist would recommend and buying everything that came on tv (Proactiv, X-out, biore, Burt’s bee’s) benzoyl peroxide just wasn’t working and felt it wasn’t good for my skin. Finally got on accutane and acne cleared up considerably in the 6 months I took it. Took about another year off the drug into college washing with cetaphil (only thing I use now) before I was really happy. Cleared acne and don’t have any scarring. Gave it a 9/10 because it worked for me but was definitely expensive, couldn't really be in the sun for 6 months, and once a month blood draws were drawbacks.	9	July 23, 2019	10
Accutane	Acne	I have cystic acne…was shocked to learn my doctor recommended accutane. From monthly nose bleeds, to severe dry lips, severe dry skin, scalp, and major joint pain in my feet, upper back, forearm and knees…all which caused me to have a torn meniscus in my knee! So not worth it! I am now struggling to stand/walk and even lying down is just painful. I personally wouldn’t have gone thru this hassle since it made things worse for me. I do have acne scars now more while I was on it…but the redness/flair ups have calmed down during my hormonal monthlys. I don’t see much of a difference.  Getting drug filled was a pain since pharmacies don't know how to fill this drug probperly…they don’t check the ipledge first before filling drug so it screws up the status. I am a bit worried about the long term side effects and not even sure if the acne really cured me.	5	July 12, 2019	7
Accutane	Acne	In high school, I suffered with severe, cystic acne. I had acne on my chest and back as well. I was so insecure with myself. I tried birth control first, along with almost every different type of face wash you can purchase. I tried eating completely clean. I tried EVERYTHING!!! Finally I saw a dermatologist and was prescribed Accutane. This was by far the best decision I ever made! I was on it for 8 months I believe. The first few months your acne will stay the same or get a tiny bit worse however after a few months you’ll start to see it clear up and by the end of it I was completely acne free. This was in 2016, my senior year of high school. It is now 2019 and I am still acne free. Every now and then I will have a breakout or two but that is just life. If you are debating on taking this, I 100% would recommend it. I suffered NO side effects besides chapped lips and dry skin but I managed this by using aquaphor religiously!	10	July 10, 2019	21
Accutane	Acne	"I had a hard time with acne. I tried everything. Went through a cycle of doxycycline, used benzoyl peroxide, and salicylic acid for face wash. Even tried to use Proactiv. Nothing worked and my Acne was getting out of hand.  I needed to do something drastic and my doctor had recommended Accutane. At first I was hesitant, since it took a long commitment and it sounded like a risky process. The ""no alcohol"" part didn't help either. But when I finally bit the bullet and went for it, it ended up being a great decision because my face was saved.  The first few months my acne was still bad and getting a tad worse, but by month 4 I only had one pimple left on my face. This was in 2016 and today in 2019 I have very little problems with acne, with the exception of a pimple here and there. I am so glad I went through the treatment because I feel it gave me a new life, free from worry about acne.  If you're able to do this treatment, I recommend you go for it."	10	June 25, 2019	31
Accutane	Acne	I had really bad acne but after taking this med I haven't had hardly anymore acne and I look a lot better and I'm not depressed as much either!!!	10	June 22, 2019	17
Accutane	Acne	IF YOUR DEBATING TO TAKE THIS MEDICATION OR NOT , PLEASE DO IT! YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT. I suffered from cystic acne and my dermatologist recommended me this drug and I read reviews on it and there was so many bad reviews and so many negative things towards Accutane but I promise you its not as bad as people put it out to be. Although everyones experience on Accutane is different, mine was very good. By the first month I saw change. Some of the side effects that I experienced was sore muscles in the first month. Also another side effect was dryness, OMG when I tell you my skin was dry. The products I used was Cetaphil as a gentle wash and CeraVe as a moisturizer and that's it. Do not use anything more than that, your skin is so fragile and sensitive while on Accutane. My HOLY GRAIL item was CARMEX for my lips. Finally I just wanna say regardless of the side effects on Accutane, it was worth it I promise you! If you have cystic acne and want to get rid of it PLEASE TAKE THIS!	10	June 17, 2019	39
Accutane	Acne	I've been on Accutane for 11 months  now and still have awful acne on my back. Doctor is surprised. Said usually clears in 5 months.  Terrible side effects and very ineffective for me.	2	June 15, 2019	14
Accutane	Acne	Please do not take this medication. I know you are struggling and have tried everything to clear it, but the side effects of this medication are not worth it. Did it clear my acne? Sure, but I had horrible dry skin, had to layer Vaseline on my lips before I went to bed. There were days I couldn’t open my mouth because the corners of my mouth would crack and bleed. It sent my cholesterol thru the roof and the monthly blood draws are a hassle. I ended up the in ER with severe abdominal pain after 5 months on the medication. I had a CT scan and colonoscopy, and I was only 19 years old. The scans showed my intestines were severely inflamed and of course I had to stop the medication immediately. Now, many years later my acne is back and I still suffer from digestive issues that I attribute to this medication. I can 100% understand your need for a solution to clear up your acne, but please educate yourself on ALL of the potential side effects.	1	June 14, 2019	28
Accutane	Rosacea	3 weeks in on Accutane for rosacea. My rash has doubled in size & I look like a beetroot by the end of the day.  After trying everything else for 4 years,  This (oratane in Australia)  was all that was left to try. For vanity's sake I hope that I get back to what I had before.  Too scared to keep going...	1	June 9, 2019	9
Accutane	Acne	Accutane is bad. Took 60 MG for 3 months. I knew something was wrong end of month 2 when my face started turning red and getting hot. Here I am now haven’t taken the drug in months and still have the same issues. Drug didn’t help my acne either. I am happy for  all the people this drug has helped but I’ve never ever been in such a dark place in my life. Can’t even go outside and enjoy life because my skins gonna start burning in 2 seconds. Ugh I’m getting so worked up writing this because my life has really been shattered since I made the decision to take the drug. I wish I did more research.	1	June 5, 2019	11
Accutane	Acne	I am so thankful that I eventually tried Accutane. Literally tried everything before this and am so glad I did! I had horrible acne even some cystic acne that was so painful ever since I can remember. Started Accutane and aside from the extremely dry skin and I even got a rash sometimes, the side effects are tolerable and it cleared my skin up 100%! I started it when I was 19 years old. I took 6 months of it and my face was officially clear. It’s been almost two years now and I haven’t had a zit. NOT ONE. My skin went back to normal and not dry. Highly recommended! It’s hard while on it, but the results are so worth it.	10	June 4, 2019	24
Accutane	Acne	I took Accutane at age 40 and I regret not taking it sooner. My skin & lips did not become overly dry.  I did have blood work done every month & signed paperwork saying I would use birth control. This medication changed my life. My face cleared up almost immediately. No more embarrassing cystic acne that kept me from enjoying my life. I had read horror stories, but spoke to several people who had success with this drug. For me it was worth the risk. I tried creams, lotions, potions, multiple antibiotics, and nothing worked.	10	June 4, 2019	38
Accutane	Acne	I honestly can’t explain how much accutane has changed my life for the better. I know side effects can be worse on certain people than others, but if acne gets you down, makes you feel worthless and affects your day to day living, accurate honestly solves it. It’s not guaranteed forever, but I’m a new person thanks to it, I couldn’t be more grateful.	10	May 17, 2019	18
Accutane	Acne	Accutane has been a great for my skin as  I struggled with mild acne from the age of 12-18 years old. When I hit college, my skin became extremely oily and my small pimples became deep cysts. I saw a dermalogist and was put on Differin and also Duac. I went through several courses of antibiotics without ever getting fully clear skin. My derm told me that accutane was the next step. The only bad side effects I had besides the dry skin and dry lips was some pretty horrendous headaches at the beginning. My derm made me take a week off taking the and them headaches never returned. Besides that, my accutane course was great and my blood work was just fine.   Before accutane I was too embarrassed to be seen by anyone including family without make up on. Now I can leave my house with no make up. This is true freedom, my skin is now JUST skin and I can look people in the eye and not worry about them staring at a huge cyst on my face. I wish I had done this ten years ago!	10	May 13, 2019	26
Accutane	Acne	Make sure you have BLOOD TESTS RUN OFTEN!	8	May 12, 2019	10
Accutane	Acne	Not gonna lie, this drug is painful.  So many side effects.  I'm in my 6th and hopefully final month today.  I have experienced dry lips and skin, extreme eye irritation, headaches, bad scarring, and oddly enough abnormal hair growth.  I think because the cells are turning over at a faster rate, the hair follicle is too.  Therefore I am a hairy beast now. . YAY.  It was not like this before accutane.  It has mostly cleared up my acne, but the purge was so bad that it brought everything to the surface and now I have dents and bad hyper-pigmentation from pimples that I didn't even have before accutane.  It looks pretty bad.  I still get pimples too.  Which stinks, but I guess at least it's not cystic ones anymore.  I cannot wait to get off this medicine.  I guess it works for huge cystic acne, but it was not for me.  Also it was expensive.  And I had pharmacy and ipledge trouble every time I tried to retrieve the medicine.	6	May 3, 2019	8
Accutane	Acne	"There are many times I've used the word ""acne"" as an enduring burden, but its been something that I will never forget.It was 7th grade when it got bad and I beat myself up that it was my fault I looked a certain way, that people blazingly stared at me, and that I wasn't enough for my peers or myself in my appearance. My mom then took me to the dermatologist and although we went through many prescriptions, none seemed to provide the right solution, except finally after 3 years Accutane the acne was done. I hope that whoever is reading right now first knows that YOU aren't alone and that it is necessary to have someone who can help you through it. Accutane has several side effects (one of them is depression); but, if you write a diary or just remember that YOU'RE beautiful in every single way and that this is temporary, then you will expect some CRAZY miracles. I'm glad I went through this, because it has made powerful growth in my life. I wish the best to all of you on this journey!"	10	May 1, 2019	34
Accutane	Acne	Acne has been apart of my life for almost 8 years now. There has never been a day where I did not at least have one break out. So, I finally decided to jump into isotretinoin (40mg) twice daily after trying antibiotics and multiple topical that did not help. My acne has for the most part cleared with one break out in my 6 month of treatment. Although, the side effects are brutal. I am talking peeling layer of skin of my lips daily while using medicated chapstick the entire duration of treatment. I am talking bloody noses and dried scabs from constant bleeding. I am getting my nose cauterized because of how easily my blood vessels break from the repeated dryness. My eyes hurt after looking at classwork or the computer for an hour. The last big side effect was dry eczema on my arms. All I can say is I am glad to be completing treatment. Although everyone seems to react different so please understand my side effects may not equal yours.	5	March 31, 2019	18
Accutane	Acne	I’ve only been on accutane for a month or so now and plan on updating this once I’ve finished the whole 6 months but... so far I’ve seen a bigggg difference in my skin. I’ve had severe acne for the past 2 years and was on doxycycline before accutane and my face has calmed down a lot, no active acne really mostly scars as of now. I was expecting a big break out (still could happen). The side effects I have gotten are dry skin but it’s not flakey or anything. My lips on the other hand oh my god stock up on chapstick before starting this! very dry and the corners of my mouth have cracked and it is pretty uncomfortable but nothing I can’t handle. If your considering going on accutane I’d recomend it in such a short period of time my skins cleared up drastically it’s amazing. (it’s not the same for everyone)	9	March 18, 2019	14
Accutane	Acne	I was on accutane (roaccutane in Australia) for a year and finished 2 years ago. The tablets were 10mg, I started on 1 every other day for a month, then 1 a day for two months, then 2 a day for six months, back down to 1 a day for two months and then 1 every other day again for the last month. I had an amazing experience, my skin completely cleared up and still is apart from the occasional hormonal pimple. I experienced pretty much no side effects, I had quite oily skin before so my skin pretty much went to normal/slightly dry, nothing severe like flaky peeling skin or anything like that, I just put on my face cream morning and night and there were no issues. As for my lips, they were slightly dry but nothing some lip balm wouldn’t fix, never once did they peel or crack and bleed as I’ve heard from some people. Accutane was the best thing I ever did for my skin and I would do it all over again if I needed to!	10	March 13, 2019	39
Accutane	Acne	Reading all these horror stories from those who took this medication, I can see how they would scare someone off considering to take Accutane. Speaking as someone who suffered from severe acne in highschool I KNOW the emotional toll it has a persons self esteem.  I took accutane for a total of 6 months and to say it has been a LIFE SAVER would be an understatement.  2 years later and no crazy side effects, or third arm growing.  These days I get nothing less than a single pimple every now and again.  This medication is a life saver if you can take it!	10	March 11, 2019	27
Accutane	Acne	Starting off, I just want to say that there is A LOT of bad stigma around accutane and most of it is NOT True. Anyways, I was always very timid about accutane as well were my parents were really against it. I'm sure if you're reading this, you've heard some horror stories about this medication. A point to consider is that Accutane most likely does not cause Depression (unless you have a history of mental health issues) in most people. However, having cystic acne can be really hard on people. I felt no fluctuation in my mood, and it honestly changed my life. If you're reading this, you most likely have bad acne. It's important to consider all your options before trying this heavy-hitting drug. It should be only used as a last resort. Spending Hundreds of dollars on BS face creams that don't work, it was really nice to find something that actually worked. Please consult with a professional and don't take advice from Random People on the internet. See if it is right for you.  Thanks!	10	March 6, 2019	36
Accutane	Acne	If you are googling accutane and reading this please be open minded about the medication. My biggest problem was I googled everything before taking it and had my funeral planned. For me accutane has been a life changer!!! I’ve had none of the side effects or anything I read or heard was even true. I didn’t break out more, never got depressed, bones didn’t hurt none of the above! Only clear skin and some dry lips at times. I took 60mg daily for 4 months. I’m 5 foot 105 lbs... they base it off weight. My dermatologist had me try everything under the sun and nothing worked but this. She swore by it and told me 1% of people get all those gnarly side effects and to try it and worse case scenario you stop taking it and we explore other options. I’m telling you, try it!!!! Be open minded and grateful that there is something out there for us pimple oil heads.	10	March 5, 2019	44
Accutane	Acne	My sophomore and junior year of high school, I took Accutane for the 6 month period. I took it again my freshman year of college, but for a shorter period of time. My skin was excessively dry, I experienced frequent nosebleeds, and my lips were appalling. As a result of taking Accutane for a total of around 15 months, my health changed and so did my confidence. They warn you of potential side effects, but they refuse to discuss healthier alternatives with you until it’s too late. As a result of this medication, I now experience GI distress and symptoms of Irritible Bowel Syndrome (IBS). I am 20 years old, and I firmly believe this medication is the cause. Despite making lifestyle changes, I still experience horrible episodes of constipation, and my acne has come back worse than before. My confidence is lower, and sometimes I feel hopeless. I am writing this review because I feel passionate about encouraging those considering Accutane not to go through with it. It’s not worth it!	1	February 20, 2019	20
Accutane	Acne	Before starting this medication I had struggled with acne for years, had a history of depression in my teens, had no back pain or joint pain, and I had a full head of hair. Month 1 dry lips and my acne got much worse. By month 3 the body/ joint pain started. Month 5 I was taking Tylenol 4 times a day everyday for back pain and  every joint in my body was popping and crunching. Acne never fully cleared. Month 2 off of it and my acne started coming back and my hair started falling out. I'm 5 months off now. My hair is STILL falling out and none of my doctors can tell me if/ when it will stop or if it will grow back. My back still hurts every joint in my body pops and is sore and my knees and shoulders crunch with minimal movement. I haven't been myself in 8 months, always angry and depressed. If I had known in order to have mostly clear skin all I had to sacrifice was half the hair on my head, my personality, and my back and joints I would not have done it.	1	February 13, 2019	17
Accutane	Acne	yeah this thing is rubbish, first of all it can give you depression (which I had before taking this, and it made it worse).  Also my acne is still fondly growing on my face and I'm pretty sure it made it worse. I'm starting to get small zits but also very big cysts that are developing under the skin, it's like a you could do a mountain bike race on my face, I also have acne on my chest and back, So all  accutane is doing is drying my lips instead of doing the thing it's supposed to.	1	February 7, 2019	7
Accutane	Acne	Accutane changed my life. I am 24 and have had acne since age 11, first on my back and then in high school it spread all over my face. It was debilitating and people looked at my skin rather than me. I felt terrible and invisible. Accutane works by preventing your oil glands from producing oil. My face was dry but people started looking at me for me! My skin cleared right up and literally have had only minor problems since.  My boyfriend also went on accutane and had a different experience altogether. He was very depressed, had hallucinations, etc. He's also the type that needs to turn the lights off for two hrs before bed and if he drinks coffee at 3 pm he'll stay up until 1 am because of it. His body is very sensitive and  yet his sisters had a great experience with the drug. Two years later he still thinks his life is changed because of the two weeks he spent on accutane. I know I would take depression and anxiety any day over how crappy I felt with my acne.	10	January 20, 2019	10
Accutane	Acne	"I was concerned about taking this drug because of the dermatologists ""over cautious"" warning against it, especially the video they played with the never ending list of harmful side effects its been known to cause individuals. Everything I've every heard about accutane has scared me away from it. However, I wished I tried it sooner. Like most people that suffer from acne, I have tried antibiotics, Clindamycin, Tretinoin, and basically every cleanser known to man. None of it did anything to improve my acne but, this stuff, this stuff works! It is the only thing that works. I wish I tried it sooner..."	10	January 3, 2019	21
Accutane	Acne	Accutane was truly a blessing for me. I was discouraged and honestly scared to go on the medication after doing research and reading all the stories and reviews. At 17 years old my acne was so bad it completely destroyed my self-confidence, and I was beyond desperate to find a way to stop it that I didn’t care what it took. Within the first 2 months of starting the treatment people began noticing a difference. Lotion and moistizuring became my best friend for those 6 months, luckily I did not experience anything worse than that. A word to the wise though: do NOT drink while on this medication it already compromises your liver and I  had to learn this the hard way. Overall 10/10 drug, I’ve been off of it for about 2 years and all my scars and hyperpigmentation have faded, and I maybe get a single pimple every couple weeks, If that. Moral of the story, there IS hope, your scars and acne will go away and you will be able to feel like yourself again!	10	November 29, 2018	36
Accutane	Acne	I had clear skin all through my teens and acne only started when I was 23. It was the very severe and nothing worked so I went on a 6 months course of Accutane, side effects weren't that bad as I had a very oily skin and I did feel it dried my eyes, throat and lips but not that bad.  My skin was clear for only 4 years and then acne came back again, very severe :(  I had a second 6 months course and same side effects.  Now, I am 45 and still suffer from bouts of severe acne but I have been trying to avoid going back fro a third course of reaccutane as my dermatologist recommended I go for it a couple of months ago when he saw my latest severe acne, it is really painful and bad.  I am now on antibiotics and topical cream and face wash. it helped a bit but not that much.  I developed diabetes four years ago and am concerned if I take roaccutane now, it could have different side effects.  Any advice?	8	November 29, 2018	2
Accutane	Acne	I've had acne my whole life (age 29). Face was always oily and I'd pop pimples all the time. Started accutane in January. Face and lips started getting really dry. Eucerin lotion and Aquaphor worked very well but needed to apply several times a day. Eczema on the top of my hands, wrists and upper arms (small red bumps that I've never had before in my life) so more lotion was required. By the middle of the second month, my acne was gone. I had dry eyes that required artificial tears at least 8 times a day. After 3 months my doctor told me I can discontinue taking it. It did not hold me back from being active and traveling through a few countries either. The side effects had disappeared except for a few small bumps only on my upper arms. It is November now. Still haven't seen a single pimple on my face! Had mild depression and anxiety but I've also had a long history even before taking accutane. Different people will have different results and side effects. Best of luck to everyone.	7	November 15, 2018	31
Accutane	Acne	This treatment is not worth it in a long run. My case was pretty severe when I was about 19 I decided to try this and my acne reduced quite insignificantly while at the same time my skin was so dry I could peel it off on morning, it also made it itchy from dryness and I would involuntarily scratch myself in sleep which made me look like I been attacked by cats the next day. Also your skin looses elasticity and if you frown a lot you may develop wrinkles on your forehead. Lost hair density by about 20% which I never regained back and I would get unjustified mood shifts on few occasions as if I was taking some anabolic steroids. I've stopped 1 month before the end of my last cycle but I wish I never started. Eventually my acne went away naturally when I was fully grown man around age of 22. You can't defy nature or it will mess you up, this is in your genes you just have to stick it out.	2	November 9, 2018	5
Accutane	Acne	I have a friend who is in stage 5 kidney failure because of this drug. She is only 20 years old. She has to get a kidney transplant and will suffer for the rest of her life because of accutane.  PLEASE DO NOT USE ACCUTANE! It may affect you for the rest of your life.	1	November 1, 2018	14
Accutane	Acne	I took Accutane 60 mg daily for 4 months for moderate acne on my arms, shoulders and back. Before starting, my acne was inflamed and painful and I was extremely self-conscious of my body. My side effects were not that bad--dry skin, lips, rashy arms--, but I do think it slightly exacerbated my depression while on it.  Three months after taking my last dose, my skin looks a lot better and I'm so glad I made this decision. Here's hoping it lasts.	10	October 28, 2018	8
Accutane	Acne	I started getting mild acne on my chin when I was 18 for which my doctor put me on birth control which cleared my skin and kept me completely blemish free for 6 years.  I got off birth control last year to try and have a baby and WOW did my skin go crazy. I went to a dermatologist in AU and they put me straight onto Accutane.  I was on 40mg a day for 6 months whilst not taking any birth control but I did have to sign a legal document stating I would NOT fall pregnant whilst taking this medicine and for 1 month after completion.  This medicine was honestly an easy breeze for me and I did not have many issues with it except the following; dry lips, mild mood swings and slight blurry eyes.  It worked but only time will tell if my acne returns.	9	October 22, 2018	9
Accutane	Acne	Please before you take Accutane really consider the side affects. Some of these reviews kind of down play them but some are actually very serious. I have been on Accutane for 1 month and I started to lose hair on my temples (like my hairline is receding) and I’m only 18. I’m really scared that it may not grow back and from what I’ve read that might be a possibility. I’m telling you don’t go in this drug unless you have extremely severe acne. If it is moderate like mine just try to accept it the risk is not worth it.	3	October 13, 2018	15
Accutane	Acne	I took Isotretinoin for 27 days from  December 2017 to January 2018. At the time I was 21 and I had exhausted all other options . After a brief consultation with my GP who assured me that the drug was safe and the listed side effects were uncommon, I was placed on 40mg a day for 6 months (I’m a 5-9 male 160 lbs). The side effects that I experienced at first were as follows: dry lips+skin, light sensitivity and slight joint pain. Week 3 I suffered from a major nodular breakout (which is to be expected), severe brain fog, and short term memory loss. Terrified, I quit the medication as my memory is my most prized possession. 3 months following my drug refusal, my short-term memory came back for the most part and I was 100% clear. At month 3.5 I encountered an SE : a virtually non-existing libido and general numbness in the phallic region. September 2018, my libido slowly came back and I started breaking out again with mild to moderate acne on my face and scalp.	10	October 5, 2018	6
Accutane	Acne	I had to take two courses, genuinely think this drug saved my life. I had beyond severe painful, bulging, cystic acne everywhere that nothing worked with while in high school. I had to wear undershirts because I would bleed through my shirts. Had to quit sports because any contact would cause bleeding, not to mention pain. Was essentially bullied out of high school due to the severity of my skin, I literally to this day have never seen anyone with as bad of acne as I had. It completely cleared up my skin after the first course, after a few months, it did come back, pretty harshly by most people’s standards, but literally nothing in comparison to what it was. I took another course, and I have clear skin to this day, 6 years later with minimal scarring. Only side effect I had was dry everything, skin eyes nose lips. People say it causes depression, I think having severe acne is much more likely to cause depression then accutane	10	October 4, 2018	45
Accutane	Acne	I have just finished month two and my face is the smoothest it has ever been. Fair skinned people you will definitely look like you have a sunburn in the first month but it goes away. I did purge bad in the first three to four weeks but it was manageable.  This thing is a miracle drug, and only side effect I have had it SOME lower back pain, fatigue and SLIGHTLY dry skin and lips. I attest my lack of symptoms due to my one gallon of water I drink everyday and unwavering moisturizing skills.  Ladies, butter yourself up everyday with that ultra repair cream and some rosehip oil and you will be fine.  I thought this would be really bad but maybe everyone is sensitive OR I just got lucky. Anyways, I highly recommend this drug. Don't think you can still eat absolute junk and it will still work, eat as healthy as you can, exercise, limit stress, eat clean and indulge every once in a while and let accutane do its job.	10	September 25, 2018	27
Acebutolol	Sectral (acebutolol) for Premature Ventricular Depolarizations	Been on sectral for 15 years at a dose of 200mg  a day for Premature Ventricular Depolarizations, after having an ablation for  a bad pathway. Sectral is a miracle drug for me...keeps me low a slow...no issues.	10	July 31, 2020	1
Acebutolol	High Blood Pressure	Acebutolol (for whatever reason) is hard to find user info on. I have been on it almost 1 year & once my body adjusted to it (less than 1 week), it has been pleasant. No side effects, no hair loss. It keeps my BP in perfect range & my resting HR has gone from 98 to 62 (I wear a FitBit 24/7). I've also been able to lose 40lbs while on this medication (further helping my HR & BP). I take it at night so any fatigue will occur while I'm sleeping.	10	July 17, 2020	1
Acella Hydrocortisone Acetate - Pramoxine Singles	Proctofoam HC (hydrocortisone / pramoxine) for Hemorrhoids	I respond the best to Proctofoam and have tried a few other products; I hate to use Proctofoam at almost $50 a squirt; Some genius shortened the tip of the applicator where it is more suited for anal use. Yes I know about ring of vein around the anus BUT when they are swollen inflamed engorged..the new and not improved syringe is worthless. I have 1 for use in the US and the other when I go to a foreign country and keep it there. It stops the bleeding and anemia. I have had them injected, rubber banded over the years. I decided to 'bite the bullet' and have them excised about 5 years ago and a colon and rectal surgeon told me to get lost because of several medical problems... Proctofoam save my butt again a few day ago.	9	October 2, 2020	0
Acella Hydrocortisone Acetate - Pramoxine Singles	Hemorrhoids	I’m only 32 and I had my very first thrombosed hemorrhoid, how I got it I have no idea ... I’m young athletic and don’t pass hard stools. Needless to say it sucked, and a major discomfort... my doctor prescribed me hydrocortisone 2.5 (2xs a day for a week). It’s been 72 hours and so far so good, the swelling goes down by the day and the discomfort/ pain of the hemorrhoid also has been improving drastically. I’ve bumped up the application to 3xs a day, hopefully by next week I can go back normal!!!	9	February 10, 2020	4
Acella Hydrocortisone Acetate - Pramoxine Singles	Hemorrhoids	I am only 39 and got a sudden huge external hemorrhoid (My first). It was very painful so I went to the doctor because I wasn’t sure if it was an abscess or a hemorrhoid. The doc prescribed this cream. It was expensive but it worked. After 5 days, it has shrunk by half. I try to use 2-3 times a day. It’s not too easy. I use my finger and not the applicator which is junk.	9	December 18, 2019	4
Acella Hydrocortisone Acetate - Pramoxine Singles	Proctofoam HC (hydrocortisone / pramoxine) for Hemorrhoids	Used the product. Did not foam as I assume the can was defective. Used what oozed out and applied it on top of the Hemorrhoid ( which at 63 was the 1st time this has happened to me ) and found no relief at all. !! I’m taking it back to CVS for a refund in the morning! 55 dollar copay with good insurance is just plain and simply ridiculous even if it had worked properly!! As I soak in the tub I wonder how anyone could tolerate this type of discomfort for more than a day! I’m totally dissatisfied that a product that costs this much could be so cheaply produced or designed! Shame On The Manufactures!	1	November 23, 2019	4
Acella Hydrocortisone Acetate - Pramoxine Singles	Proctofoam HC (hydrocortisone / pramoxine) for Hemorrhoids	Have used for past 3 years with good results. Use twice daily so one 10 g tube last about 15-18 days. Use when my colitis flares which happens 3 or 4 times a year.	9	October 6, 2019	2

Acella Hydrocortisone Acetate - Pramoxine Singles	Pramosone E (hydrocortisone / pramoxine) for Dermatological Disorders	This cream is amazing for my rash around my anal area.

Do you know why insurance does not pay for this cream or can I get samples somewhere? Thanks		September 23, 2019	0
Acella Hydrocortisone Acetate - Pramoxine Singles	Proctofoam HC (hydrocortisone / pramoxine) for Hemorrhoids	Works, but horribly overpriced, and in an absurdly-designed, useless, dispenser.   Customer service at MEDA Pharma. was terrible.	3	August 1, 2019	5
Acella Hydrocortisone Acetate - Pramoxine Singles	Analpram-HC (hydrocortisone / pramoxine) for Hemorrhoids	I used the Analpram-HC for my hemorrhoids for 2 weeks and had plenty cream leftover. In case of a flare up. It worked great, I tried to get the same meds again. Different Dr and wouldn't give it to me. Put me on Proctozone HC. The Analpram cream is much better.	9	June 5, 2019	5
Acella Hydrocortisone Acetate - Pramoxine Singles	Hemorrhoids	I’ve had episodes in the past with thrombosed hemorrhoids but never used the HC cream.  This time I had some mild but constant bleeding.  It has worked incredibly well. Hemorrhoids shrank 30% in the first 24 hours and the pain is almost non existent.  I am able to function.	9	March 14, 2018	5
Acella Hydrocortisone Acetate - Pramoxine Singles	Hemorrhoids	Works great for me. Also I installed an inexpensive sprayer that hooks up to the toilet water inlet and allows you to spray clean after a bm. I find that washing allows it to heal faster along with cool water giving temporary pain relief and best of all no painful wiping.		September 2, 2017	1

Acetaminophen	Sciatica	I have had a major back surgery and after tons of morphine, oxycodone, and OxyContin, the only things that takes my low back pain to zero is Buprenorphine. No type of  injections worked either. However, the only thing, including all the opioids that helps my sciatic pain is Tylenol. I can’t take any NSAIDS due to kidney failure from Metformin and NSAIDS but they never helped my sciatica.	10	April 8, 2021	0
Acetaminophen	Pain	Tylenol has never worked even a little for me. It seems to be the go-to pain reliever at hospitals and emergency rooms here in Canada, but really does nothing, even when it's Tylenol-3. It has never even got rid a headache for me, let alone real pain.  I can't count the number of times it's been prescribed for me following surgery for broken bones (for use after I'm off morphine or other opiates). It might as well be a sugar pill. My sister is the same — it just does nothing. I don't know why they still give this to people as a pain reliever. I always end up buying naproxen or ibuprofen instead.	1	April 2, 2021	1

Acetaminophen	Tylenol (acetaminophen) for Sciatica	Tylenol did zero to help my Sciatic nerve pain, although it's helped in the past with other issues.  -  nothing else prescribed helped either but oddly enough Mocha flavoured monster drink would remove about 80% of the pain for about 5-8 hours.

Acetaminophen	Sciatica	I really recommend giving actaminophen a shot. for a while it’s the only thing that would get my through the night because of my lower back and hip pain. Nothing else worked even sleeping meds. It made me comfort enough to sleep through most of the night.

Acetaminophen	Tylenol Arthritis Pain (acetaminophen) for Pain	My doctor won't prescribe medication for my fibromyalgia and arthritis pain. He told me to take Tylenol Arthritis. Well, it works sometimes, but most of the time it barely touches the pain. If I take aspirin with it, it works better. But I'm still in a lot of pain. I don't like using creams, because I had a cat die from Icy Hot poisoning, so that's not really an option. I need something else.	5	April 10, 2020	6

Acetaminophen	Tylenol (acetaminophen) for Pain	"In the early nineties I was taking Tylenol for severe headaches. We had first responders in our workplace that pushed me to larger strengths and doses.

Acetaminophen	Tylenol (acetaminophen) for Pain	It’s one of the most worthless medicines I know of. I have tried Tylenol on numerous occasions throughout my life for migraines, back pain, menstrual cramps, post surgical pain, arthritis pain because some doctor or friend has recommended it. Each time it did absolutely nothing for me. Aspirin is a better pain reliever. Now with severe chronic pain, my Doctor wants me to try it again. No thank you. I give it 1 star because I never suffered any side effects from it.	1	July 8, 2019	13
Acetaminophen	Tylenol (acetaminophen) for Pain	I had a sudden experience of lower back pain, to the point where it hurt to breathe, and I wasn't able to sit because it meant bending my back. I took 2 pills of the extra strength. After about 15-20 minutes I could breathe without crying, it was still extremely painful to sit, but after another 15 minutes or so 90% of the pain was completely gone. So thankful  for Tylenol extra strength!	10	May 31, 2019	13
Acetaminophen	Tylenol Extra Strength (acetaminophen) for Pain	I had my rotator cuff repaired and I was sent home with a block in my arm that did not even last 24 hours. Also I was sent home with a liquid bulb of pain medicine around my neck with the tubing inserted into my shoulder. In less than 24 hours the tubing leaked twice and finally just fell out. I had one pain medicine prescription. I had to half each one into 4. It was terrible pain and the doctors advised me to take extra strength Tylenol. It does noting for me. I don’t understand why there’s a push to take Tylenol. I’m certain Tylenol would work for me if I exceeded the recommended does. Thus, why so many people have liver damage. Tylenol and extra strength Tylenol is like taking nothing. I even tried going without it and then taking Tylenol. No difference!!!  Nothing!!		February 6, 2019	7
Acetaminophen	Sciatica	"My doctor insisted I take acetaminophen in spite of me telling him it has never helped with any pain I have ever had, and surprise! It had no effect on my severe sciatica pain either.  I don't know why doctors keep prescribing it considering there are studies readily available to anyone who can read, that have proven that acetaminophen is no better than placebo when it comes to back pain relief (the Cochrane Reviews), AND  ""Analysis of national databases show that acetaminophen-associated overdoses account for about 50,000 emergency room visits and 25,000 hospitalizations yearly."" (Dr. Aric Hausknecht, a New York neurologist and pain management specialist.)   My experience is that it doesn't work and I can read so I know it is ineffective period and is dangerous; and I am astonished and offended when a medical professional who should know better tells me to take it for any reason."	1	February 5, 2019	11

Tylenol has helped me thru all of it. From migraines, to horrible monthly cramps. Crazy when I think about it...It allowed me to function normally through some of the worst moments of life. I am, thankfully, a perfectly healthy 51 yr old and 2 hrs ago I woke with a sickening headache from 3 days of hard yard work. All gone now.

I'm allowed up to 4 per day, but now I take one or two since I started to use Tylenol 8 hour. I use the store brand of it too and it works just as well.	9	December 21, 2017	12
Acetaminophen	Pain	It cannot be overstated how dangerous this medication is.  Over 100 teens DIE yearly in the USA ALONE from an Acetaminophen OD.  I believe personal experience is illustrative & common so I'll share.  The child was not truly trying to harm herself, as with most, they don't think it can harm them, their desire is to regain control.  They may vomit - regardless, they wake the next morning feeling embarrassed but fine, unaware their liver is dying inside them - & by the time they realize they are sick, nothing can be done.  Please EDUCATE YOUR CHILDREN ON THE DANGERS of this is liver-killing POISON!  NEVER EXCEED recommended dosage, I never go above 3 doses daily, & NEVER MIX WITH ALCOHOL!  I also avoid APAP meds, 5Mg oxycone, not Percocet, etc		November 15, 2017	4

Acetaminophen (Intravenous)	Tylenol (acetaminophen) for Fever	Great if you have a fever. But if you need pain relief, This won't help.

Acetaminophen (Intravenous)	Sciatica	I really recommend giving actaminophen a shot. for a while it’s the only thing that would get my through the night because of my lower back and hip pain. Nothing else worked even sleeping meds. It made me comfort enough to sleep through most of the night.

Acetaminophen (Intravenous)	Tylenol Arthritis Pain (acetaminophen) for Pain	My doctor won't prescribe medication for my fibromyalgia and arthritis pain. He told me to take Tylenol Arthritis. Well, it works sometimes, but most of the time it barely touches the pain. If I take aspirin with it, it works better. But I'm still in a lot of pain. I don't like using creams, because I had a cat die from Icy Hot poisoning, so that's not really an option. I need something else.	5	April 10, 2020	6

Each time it did absolutely nothing for me. Aspirin is a better pain reliever. Now with severe chronic pain, my Doctor wants me to try it again. No thank you.

Acetaminophen (Intravenous)	Tylenol (acetaminophen) for Pain	I had a sudden experience of lower back pain, to the point where it hurt to breathe, and I wasn't able to sit because it meant bending my back.

I had one pain medicine prescription. I had to half each one into 4. It was terrible pain and the doctors advised me to take extra strength Tylenol. It does noting for me. I don’t understand why there’s a push to take Tylenol. I’m certain Tylenol would work for me if I exceeded the recommended does. Thus, why so many people have liver damage. Tylenol and extra strength Tylenol is like taking nothing. I even tried going without it and then taking Tylenol. No difference!!!  Nothing!!		February 6, 2019	7

Acetaminophen (Intravenous)	Tylenol 8 Hour (acetaminophen) for Pain	I use it a few times per week for pain flares with my chronic pain. It seems to work better than extra strength and longer. I don't need to rely on my oxycodone as much now that I take this for some pain flares. That being said, not every pain flare is the same and I end up still using one of my oxycodone. I'm allowed up to 4 per day, but now I take one or two since I started to use Tylenol 8 hour. I use the store brand of it too and it works just as well.	9	December 21, 2017	12
Acetaminophen (Intravenous)	Pain	It cannot be overstated how dangerous this medication is.  Over 100 teens DIE yearly in the USA ALONE from an Acetaminophen OD.  I believe personal experience is illustrative & common so I'll share.  The child was not truly trying to harm herself, as with most, they don't think it can harm them, their desire is to regain control.  They may vomit - regardless, they wake the next morning feeling embarrassed but fine, unaware their liver is dying inside them - & by the time they realize they are sick, nothing can be done.  Please EDUCATE YOUR CHILDREN ON THE DANGERS of this is liver-killing POISON!  NEVER EXCEED recommended dosage, I never go above 3 doses daily, & NEVER MIX WITH ALCOHOL!  I also avoid APAP meds, 5Mg oxycone, not Percocet, etc		November 15, 2017	4

Realized what the cause was.  I have never taken anymore and condition has not returned after three months.

Acetaminophen Tablet	Sciatica	I have had a major back surgery and after tons of morphine, oxycodone, and OxyContin, the only things that takes my low back pain to zero is Buprenorphine. No type of  injections worked either. However, the only thing, including all the opioids that helps my sciatic pain is Tylenol. I can’t take any NSAIDS due to kidney failure from Metformin and NSAIDS but they never helped my sciatica.	10	April 8, 2021	0
Acetaminophen Tablet	Pain	Tylenol has never worked even a little for me. It seems to be the go-to pain reliever at hospitals and emergency rooms here in Canada, but really does nothing, even when it's Tylenol-3. It has never even got rid a headache for me, let alone real pain.  I can't count the number of times it's been prescribed for me following surgery for broken bones (for use after I'm off morphine or other opiates). It might as well be a sugar pill. My sister is the same — it just does nothing. I don't know why they still give this to people as a pain reliever. I always end up buying naproxen or ibuprofen instead.	1	April 2, 2021	1

Acetaminophen and Codeine Oral Solution	Tylenol with Codeine #3 (acetaminophen / codeine) for Pain	I take Tylenol 3 for tension migraines. For about 5 years, I took two pills and they eliminated the pain within 45-60 minutes. Worked every time for 5 years, and only recently has effectiveness decreased. A couple of months ago, I had to increase my dosage to 2.5 pills to achieve the same result. Tylenol 3 only works for my migraines. I recently had dental work done, and had to take something stronger for the pain.	8	December 13, 2020	1

Acetaminophen and Codeine Oral Solution	Tylenol with Codeine #3 (acetaminophen / codeine) for Pain	I just started on these Tylenol with Codeine #3, I have had chronic pain since 2005 and have been on norco for 8 yrs for a fusions in neck.  My sister was dying in hospice and I was packed to go be with her in last days and out of the blue they called for a pill count> mind you<they haven't called for pill count in 8 yrs. And I said one cuss word to the girl because she said you may get kicked out and they did because of me cussing - true story - so I had to find someone else and started me on tylonol with codeine useless for pain, the other doctor messed me up.	1	August 23, 2020	3
Acetaminophen and Codeine Oral Solution	Tylenol with Codeine #3 (acetaminophen / codeine) for Osteoarthritis	I have had two hip replacements, one being 13 years ago, the other 7. Excruciating pain occurs in my SI every now and then, of course when one over does it. T3's are the most reliable relief, two extra strength tylenols don't even touch the discomfort and pain intensity. Whereas, with one T3, I can actually perform daily tasks.  I do not usually use it for more than two days in a row.. and usually many months apart. I have positive results and they work so well.	9	August 15, 2020	10
Acetaminophen and Codeine Oral Solution	Tylenol with Codeine #4 (acetaminophen / codeine) for Pain	It should be noted I've been on pain medications for 21 years so you can imagine I've tried it all, I use Tylenol #4 for breakthrough pain and for me it works very well from an 8/10 to a 3-5/10 but bearable.  We each have different metabolisms that being said and as a result medicine doesn't do the same thing for everyone some of you will do well with Percocet or Vicodin, they don't work well for me but T4s do. Go figure.....so when you go to a doctor or go to the dentist they will take your opinion on this matter into consideration.  Only we know what works for us.  I saw so many reviews for T3s or T4s that said it didn't work for them it probably did to a minimal extent, but again you know your body and what pain medications especially that work for you I wish you all good luck in the future but for me T4s work wonders for me	8	June 25, 2020	9
Acetaminophen and Codeine Oral Solution	Tylenol with Codeine #4 (acetaminophen / codeine) for Pain	Hi,  Although I do agree with everyone that these Tylenol-anything are junk for pain (especially if you’ve been on more effective pain relievers prior for a while), I just wanted to point out to all who are saying they’re flooding your liver with acetaminophen now that the DEA caused you to switch from other ones... Norco and T4s have all the same amount of Tylenol (aka acetaminophen or paracetamol depending where you’re from).  Just wanted to mention that, as well as that generic brands of all these have the exact same narcotics in them as the name brands so I’m not sure why people think they’re less effective. Maybe it’s the fillers? Who knows.  Anyways, yeah I agree that the DEA has screwed everyone in the USA. Something similar is happening here in Canada and it sucks for pain patients here so bad too! :(	2	April 30, 2020	4

Acetaminophen and Codeine Oral Solution	Pain	I thought it was just me; like maybe I somehow smoked too much marijuana and my body started to reject the pain relief from T3. Seems like this is not the case though because these pills do absolutely nothing. Not sure if they're some type of placebo or something but the infected cavity that I have currently sitting on my jaw nerve is supremely painful. When's the last time you seen a grown man cry? I've been taking these useless pills like candy hoping that they eventually kick in but these seemingly work slightly less better than Goody/BC powder.	2	December 5, 2019	6

Acetaminophen and Codeine Oral Solution	Tylenol with Codeine #3 (acetaminophen / codeine) for Pain	I have been on pain medicine for about 2 decades, due to pain caused  by a motor bike crash. Broke my leg in three parts and crushed ankle etc. At first they put me on many pain medicine like morphine, oxy and many others but I got very addicted to them  due to my severe pain. So my doctors started cutting down slow and they started using Tylenol 3 and therapy. So now it has been over two decades and I am taking 6 Tylenol 3 a day with therapy. I am doing okay. I have to admit there is days that I have severe pain that Tylenol 3 relieves my pain a little. My advice for you out there that will have to take pain killers (that is what I call them) for a very long time,  before you would get out of control with them, go for therapy to know how to have self control over them.	9	July 26, 2019	21

Acetaminophen and Codeine Oral Solution	Tylenol with Codeine #3 (acetaminophen / codeine) for Pain	I got all four wisdom teeth out two days ago and was prescribed this medication by the specialist I saw. The actual procedure went well, but as soon as I got home (about an hour post-op), the throbbing pain in my upper and lower jaw began. I was unable to sleep the first few hours, then slept for about two during the night. The second day was worse, I wasn’t able to sleep at all and the second night I began throwing up.

Acetaminophen and Codeine Oral Solution	Pain	"Dr. prescribed generic brand Tylenol #4 for arthritis, knee, back pain. I had been in pain at a level of 8-10. I was sent for Pain Management, no help. Dr. prescribed the acetaminophen with codeine 3 times a day and so last 5 years pain at a level of  3-4. For me it works. It has very low addiction rate. ""Codeine is a weak opioid, about 10% is metabolized to morphine. Still potential for abuse-addiction."" That depends on individual.  Long term use can cause issues, patient should be tested and followed by Dr. I moved from Birmingham to Mobile Ala. The Mobile Dr. was terrified,  said he would not risk losing his license. This is a Schedule III drug. Does not cause majority users to become addicted to it. This Dr. was unwilling to help or  discuss it, said take OTC pain remedy.  Checked with med. ins. co., pharmacy, it's approved, can be prescribed by Dr. with refills."	8	June 6, 2019	3

Acetaminophen and Codeine Oral Solution	Pain	First, let me say that after reading many comments I'm surprised that people use Empracet for toothaches . They should use an anti-inflammatory like celebrex or naproxin, not codeine because the pain is due to inflammation . Anyway, I'm taking Empracet 30 (Acetaminophen and Codeine )  for Shingles in my face. If you think that a tooth ache is painful, shingles is WORST. Codeine help in 2 ways. It remove the stress from having shingles, i and help for the pain .  If you try to use it for something that have to do with bones ( breaking ,surgery, root canals ) it won't help much. I had a surgery in my hand and they had to cut the bones in my small finger and put some pins to hold the 2 bones together so that they fuse together. THIS was PAINFUL and Tylenol/codeine didn't do much , even if I took 2 or 3.  Some new medications for pain management will come soon. I hope so.  I live in Québec so the Rx if almost free , cost= $5 for 20 pills. Doctor= $0	9	December 29, 2018	5
Acetaminophen and Codeine Oral Solution	Pain	Tylenol #3 or Tylenol with Codeine is one of the most effective painkiller for me however, just the  original Brand is effective and generics especially the one with letter M on it  just doesn't  work at all. If your doctor prescribe you this pain killer just make sure it is either the Brand name or if it is generic you must not get the one with letter M on it. I have been using the Brand name for more than 10 years and any time that my insurance tried to replace it with it's generic, if it was with letter M on it I had to prove to them that it is a fake medication. Any other type of generic although is not as good as the Brand sill Okay as long as it does not have Letter M on it.	1	December 19, 2018	7

Acetaminophen and Codeine Oral Solution	Pain	This was the most awful experience with a drug I’ve ever taken.  I was up for 24 hours because I could not fall asleep, nauseated, and having brutal anxiety/paranoia. This was prescribed after I had a painful surgery. I was relatively healthy considering I lost a massive amount of weight. Others had great experiences, but unfortunately it doesn’t work with me. A waste.	1	September 22, 2018	7
Acetaminophen and Codeine Oral Solution	Tylenol with Codeine #3 (acetaminophen / codeine) for Pain	Works great for my pain due to a torn Achilles tendon.

Acetaminophen and Codeine Oral Solution	Tylenol with Codeine #3 (acetaminophen / codeine) for Pain	First I must let you know I have a congenital disability that has become more severe as in pain and at my age of sixty-seven. I am some what more concern over my pain medication, which has today became a much more challenging issue in obtaining. Anyway, it is almost impossible for me to obtain good pain medication without jumping through many hoops, which I am sure some of you are now experiencing . Boy would I love to discuss that issue with you, anyway I have found that Tylenol with Codeine #3 is somewhat easy for me to get a prescription for, and it will work well with my Methadone I am now on for pain. So, sure I do believe Tylenol with Codeine is a good choice, it is very affordable, and for us with pain, it is for now. Somewhat less challenging to get our hands on, I just wish the medical model and those in control of our pain medication understand, they are actually harming us with severe pain. We don't sell our medication, because we need every pill...good luck friends.	8	June 14, 2018	25

I have been prescribed Codeine several times, many times even, over my lifetime, and each time. It seems as if I took nothing at all. I don't know why, but I just shake my head and even laugh, when they prescribe it.. After trying it yet again, thinking it was just a mistake, or they made it better.. again, it does absolutely nothing to relieve pain. I take several of them, and usually about halfway through the prescription, given me by the doctor, I switch to plain aspirin, to get some relief from pain.	1	October 18, 2017	11

After the second dose I started to panic quietly inside and I couldn't get liquid Advil out of my mind! The nurse only had tablets, so my husband arrived and rushed me to the pharmacy to get some Chldrens liquid Advil, and 30 minutes later I was pain free! I'm not touching my prescription for Tylenol 3 and will tell the doc ASAP.	1	April 18, 2017	5
Acetaminophen and Codeine Oral Solution	Tylenol with Codeine #4 (acetaminophen / codeine) for Osteoarthritis	I was in great pain. This drug helped me immensely.	10	March 29, 2017	13
Acetaminophen and Codeine Oral Solution	Tylenol with Codeine #3 (acetaminophen / codeine) for Pain	I have had all 4 of my wisdom teeth removed 2 days ago. To deal with the pain after my numbing injections wore off, I was prescribed Tylenol 3. When I got home, the pain from the operation was already starting to kick in, so I took one at 5 pm (which was when I got home) in hope of relieving my pain before trying to get to bed. I sat there in pain for the next 12 hrs, taking another pill every 4 hrs, and not a single bit of pain relief or drowsiness came to my aid.	1	March 12, 2017	26
Acetaminophen and Codeine Oral Solution	Pain	Horrid drug, caused irg heart beat and problems breathing.	1	March 1, 2017	1
Acetaminophen and Codeine Oral Solution	Tylenol with Codeine #3 (acetaminophen / codeine) for Pain	Post abdominal hysterectomy with anterior and posterior repairs and bladder lift. I was prescribed toradol 10mg scheduled every 6 hours with tylenol 3 every 4-6 as needed.   As long as I don't go any longer than those minimum times I do okay with about a 4 pain level.  I haven't been pain free yet but I guess that's to be expected.....tylenol 3 has worked ok but does start to wear off towards the end of the 4 hours. I must wait....it is a shame though that there is so much abuse of narcotic strength drugs like norco...they are extremely effective for post surgical pain....they are very addictive and Drs don't even like prescribing them much anymore	7	February 21, 2017	8
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Norco (acetaminophen / hydrocodone) for Pain	Absolute garbage. Ibuprofen works better for my tooth pain. I ended up doubling my dose and still no relief. I don’t know what the manufacturers are doing to pain pills these days but it’s wrong on so many levels.	1	April 24, 2021	6
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Norco (acetaminophen / hydrocodone) for Back Pain	I have had work related back and neck pain. I have had surgeries before and generic vicodin worked great. I haven't had any luck with Lupin generic norco. I have half a bottle left and won't take anymore because it doesn't work.  I worked in the pharmaceutical manufacturing for decades and have learned that 80 percent or more of all generics are now made overseas. FDA rarely inspects plants and have no legal jurisdiction there.  If you want to know more about the quality of your prescriptions, check the book Bottles of Lies  or look online for one  or more of her interviews.	1	April 24, 2021	2
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Pain	I am am in pain from Degenerative disc, shoulder surgery. Yes the acetaminophen + hydrocodone with imprint T257 (Camber Pharmaceuticals brand) is rubbish! The big white ones are better. Sad.I need this relief. Also just got a molar pulled/crushed out earlier today.	2	April 23, 2021	1

Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Norco (acetaminophen / hydrocodone) for Back Pain	No I don't have a pain management problem - I have a pain problem! Nobody understand a damn thing - pain is pain! Norco works wonders.	10	April 14, 2021	12
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Pain	I was 9yrs old when I was diagnosed with SLE. It was a new disease and not coming at all in youths. I suffered from severe arthritis. It was crippling, my knees would swell so bad or my ankles I would basically have to crawl, it was awful. Later on I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia severe osteoarthritis austerities i need 2 knee surgeries.  I’ve had close to 12 surgeries I’m broken down. At times my pain is so  bad I just cry. I’ve gained 50 pounds cause depression and COVID. I decided to restart physical therapy so I can get stronger for surgery.  I’m beyond out of shape. I’m stretching yada yada.... Long story short I’m in soooo much more pain it’s beyond terrible. My pain pills do not work. They haven’t but rather than saying anything I’ve just deal it with it.  I just don’t know what to do anymore.	2	April 8, 2021	9
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Norco (acetaminophen / hydrocodone) for Back Pain	CVS had generic Norco by Sun pharma NO vomiting, migraines, upset stomach. CVS had Aurobindo generic , pain was 8 after 2 tablets a 7, nausea bad.  I wrote CVS CEO and he told pharmacist to order a brand that worked for me. Pharmacy manager got ANGRY and refused to fill my pain medication  then she told my doctor, I had to go to pain management doctor. First visit the Dr came in said I read your chart you’ve had everything done to try and help your pain, so why are you here. I explained, I’m here because of a pharmacist,  I explained he was shocked a pharmacist could do this and with all my surgeries. A pharmacist would complain about four pain pills a day. Dr wrote my RX added do not fill with Mallinckrodt, Aurobindo or Amneal . 2 years no problems last few months CVS said No Sun REALLY !! Every pharmacy refuses to order other brands and every pharmacy I call says we only carry Mallinckrodt .The FDA said if no one calls to complain , then things won’t change	1	April 2, 2021	26
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Pain	I get very helpful information from this website.	10	April 2, 2021	3
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Norco (acetaminophen / hydrocodone) for Back Pain	I am reading these reviews and I’ve had the same experience. It does matter who the manufacturer is. I’ve been using Lupin! And I’ve noticed that it is the best. It does what it is supposed to do! I recommend it. The others mentioned are all garbage!	10	April 1, 2021	5
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Pain	"I'd sure like to know what is going on with these drug companies that make Norco and in my opinion and experience have changed their formula. I""m having an awful time finding a manufacturer that doesn't have terrible side effects or one even works. How do we as consumers of this particular drug make a complaint.  Why do I have to suffer as a legit patient in chronic pain have to pay the price for the countries opioid epidemic?  Then, to top that off, when I am calling around to find out what generic brand that a particular pharmacy has in stock, I'm literally treated with disrespect like I'm a drug dealer calling in.  I've got legit allergies to the fillers in some of these manufacture brand and now I'm told no pharmacy can special order me the brand name Norco by Allergan."	1	March 31, 2021	0
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Back Pain	It doesn’t do anything. I got headaches from the pain. Norco 10/325 is useless.	1	March 30, 2021	1
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Back Pain	These are bad meds, I get sick, my stomach hurts and doesn’t help with pain. Why??? Horrible med that is just anti addiction by making you sick. Both the 5 and the 7.5 don’t help pain and make you sick at your stomach. Why must we suffer??	1	March 26, 2021	1
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Vicodin (acetaminophen / hydrocodone) for Back Pain	The only medication that relieves my back pain and reduces my recovery time by several days. Although I only use it 2 or 3 times a year to treat episodes, my new doctor won't prescribe it and I'm back to severe pain and my recovery time has tripled once again. NSAIDS and PROFERNS are useless. I thought doctors were supposed to better one's quality of life and manage their pain. Have an appointment with specialists that will cost me my retirement savings, but I have to live!	10	March 26, 2021	2
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Norco (acetaminophen / hydrocodone) for Back Pain	What is going on with the Norco pills these days? I've been getting the name brand Norco made by Allergan in the 7.5, when I filled my script this month, I swear they have no opiate in them and it's straight tylenol, I've been miserable this entire month,  no relief at all, and I don't sleep at night due to RLS something isn't right.  I used to take generic Watson never had an issue but when most pharmacy switched to that Mallinckrodt manufacturer I had to quit taking due to severe allergic reactions.  So, after reading these comments I see I'm not the only one, now I don't know where to get meds refilled,  pharmacies are doing something different for sure,  these pills look the same but something is off, and they thought people would not notice, well I did right off the bat.  Ridiculous	1	March 24, 2021	42
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Pain	I have been taking the 7.5 hydrocodone for pain due to fibroids and ovarian cysts, which will be removed during my hysterectomy. I usually have no issues with how well my medication works. In fact it has helped a lot to keep me functioning, until my surgery. However, this last fill on my meds has me wondering if some companies aren't adding enough of the actual pain medicine to the mix? I can tell a HUGE difference in how my last fill of medicine is not working. It is as if it is half of the dose per pill. It really made me wonder why a company, Mallinkrodt, would not safely see the medicine is actually what it says it is, because I can tell you, it is not nearly as effective as the brand I was using, until my pharmacy switched it on me. It seems to me that could be dangerous to people. Anyway, thats my opinion. I just don't think it's right if they expect people to not notice the difference,  when clearly there is one.	3	March 22, 2021	16
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Back Pain	Recently I have been getting generics like Lupin. It doesn't work that well, I wondered if I was getting a placebo. I sat in pain most of the day.  These fat little white ones just do NOT do the job. The yellow football shaped ones work, these don't/ What a shame we have to suffer.	2	March 19, 2021	3
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Back Pain	I am a disabled and retired hard working American who can no longer work due to pain in various parts of my body back neck shoulders. I’ve been able to live with my pain and continued to work for 20 yrs with the use of Watson Norco Mallinckrodt pills.  Now for some reason during my 1 week  of taking my refilled prescription noticed lack of relief and headaches joint pain and breathing problems and  took my pills out and noticed that my pills have the imprint G036 and not the most recent M366. What?? so I went to back to ask Pharmacist if been given wrong pills? No you have a substitute because the brand Mallinckrodt is not available and being supplied by Tris which may have different fillers. What? And they didn’t think it was important to tell me this. Some one needs to address these people or someone may really get hurt. Playing with people’s medications should be a federal offence.	1	March 18, 2021	6
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Norco (acetaminophen / hydrocodone) for Pain	I'm given an RX whenever I need it of the 5/325. I suffered combat x2 injuries in Iraq and Afghanistan I only use this when I really need to and for me it's very effective in fact I break the tablet and a half so I'm only using half of one of these doses and I've never had it not help me.  Its made by Mallinckrodt No issues at all  I'm extremely safe using this medication and again only when I need it of course I have pain every day but not enough to make me take this every day and I don't want to ever become reliant on something to feel better and that may be one reason it works well for me I also combine mild exercise when I can do it and using a hot tub as water therapy helps tremendously Heating pads help too	10	March 17, 2021	2
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Norco (acetaminophen / hydrocodone) for Rheumatoid Arthritis	Feb 28,2021 I've been getting my prescription Norco 10/325 from CVS and lately they haven't been working on my pain. So I called my doctor and mention it they suggested I try a different pharmacy could be manufacturer so I did.  I tried Walgreens worse decision because they gave me a brand called Mallinckrodt. It don't help at all with pain. I've had really horrible side effects bad weigh gain, head aches, depression, forgetfulness.  Never again.	1	March 17, 2021	13
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Back Pain	I am in Chicagoland. The last few months on this med have been so bad for me. Most acetaminophen with hydrocodone don't work (6 or 7 brands available now--but only 3 of these my pharmacy can order due to thresholds or whatever) Mallinckrodt & Amneal are two awful ones--2 helped, Aurobindo & Lupin, but are now unavailable. Now on Tylenol #4, which only has me borderline sane--very little effect on my nerve pain level. Reading here, the best bet is Qualitest brand hydrocodone, but I cannot find a pharmacy that can/will order it. I am going on 65 yo in a few weeks & have no quality of life. I SHOULD be productive at this age, but need help managing my pain. I am ready to give up.	1	March 17, 2021	3
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Back Pain	I have been rx'd Norco for severe back pain, is this drug a placebo? I shouldn't still be crying in pain after taking 2. I see someone said the Mallinckrodt brand was worse than a placebo, this is absolutely 100% true. Also CVS lied to them, there are other brands but they're all junk as well. I changed pharmacies because my new pharmacist said he knew all about the Mallinckrodt junk and NEVER orders it. So now I am getting the yellow Qualitest and for the past 8 months I have gotten maybe 2 out the 8 rx's that worked, the other 6 seemed exactly like Mallinckrodt. WTH is going on? This stuff actually makes you feel terrible and makes my ears ring non-stop. It's almost Iike someone is switching them out, like taking the legit medicine and replacing it with blanks.	1	March 16, 2021	1
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Pain	Was prescribed generic hydrocodone with acetominophen following rotator cuff surgery.  Took as directed and got absolutely NO alleviation of pain.  Spent 27 hours in agony.  I have been prescribed brand-name hydrocodone in the past and it worked well.  It's almost impossible to convince a doctor that the generic isn't working.  I've never had this happen before with a generic drug.	1	March 16, 2021	4
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Pain	I just started taking these pills produced by Tris for about 3 months. I have experience much more constipation and it doesn’t help the pain. It works more like a sleeping pill. It makes me sweat and taking one does not help at all. Drs will say the generic is same as brand WHICH IS NOT TRUE. I CANNOT FIND THE WATSON BRAND OR ABBOTT ANYPLACE ANYMORE. Also taking two doesn’t help and really stops you up. Also it seems like the pill has gotten smaller. I am told never to take any more than 1 every 6 hours. But your make up of the same pill that Watson makes or use to make doesn’t come close to doing or stopping the pain. If there is another pain pill I could get I would. I can only say get your pill up to where at least it will help stop the pain.	1	March 16, 2021	6
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Vicodin (acetaminophen / hydrocodone) for Pain	I've been on both 5/325 and 7.5/325 after different surgeries and both dosages worked well.  It's my trusted painkiller that causes the least amount of side effects.  I prefer the lower dosage because it's easier to discontinue when the medication runs out.	10	March 12, 2021	1
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Norco (acetaminophen / hydrocodone) for Pain	I was prescribed Norco 10/325 after extensive ankle surgery to repair tendons and remove a bone spur.  I have taken Vicodin before, so I knew that the combination worked well for me.  I was given a week's worth and I think it may have worked a little too well.  I tried to cut the pills in half when I noticed my supply was getting low due to the pill regulations, but I still experienced horrific pain when the Norco was discontinued.  I don't like this dosage at all.  However, the medication itself works well.	8	March 12, 2021	3
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Back Pain	Generic  acetaminophen with hydrocodone ie generic Norco 10/325 is in no way, near Brand Name. Doesn’t matter what brand, they all have weird side effects, an do nothing overall, for the pain. Tiredness, confusion, and overall weird feeling. They should all be fined for making such inferior products.	1	March 10, 2021	4
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Back Pain	I don’t understand why there’s such a difference but a 5mg Vicodin name brand is as or more effective than most 10mg generic. The Watson generic is the best I’ve taken but still doesn’t work like the name brand. I wondered if others noticed this until reading reviews. I don’t know why there’s not guidelines on how medication is absorbed and effectiveness, I can’t afford to pay several hundred dollars more for to get name brand so I’m stuck with whatever generic the pharmacy has at the time.	7	March 9, 2021	2
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Vicodin (acetaminophen / hydrocodone) for Back Pain	Some pharmacy's carry 5/300 acetaminophen with hydrocodone  The 325 is rubbish ! The amount of in it is acetaminophen rubbish !	8	March 9, 2021	0
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Pain	I have noticed the change in my hydro's too. (T259). In part it is a problem with the fillers being too hard to dissolve properly . This may not help those of you who have side effects but I simply chew them up thoroughly. In fact I have found I can get by on a half of one. When I started these pills I took 5 mg and was doing fine for years. Maybe your doctor will prescribe a 5 mg dose in twice the quantity. Maybe that will help	7	March 7, 2021	0
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Norco (acetaminophen / hydrocodone) for Pain	Malinkrodt acetaminophen with hydrocodone(M367) is less effective than a placebo. How can they legally offer that product as hydrocodone? I asked my CVS pharmacist what I could do to prevent them from dispensing it the next time...even at an increased cost...and he gave me some gibberish answer like there is no other manufacturer available to them. Maybe it's a Govt plot to wean people off the pain meds by giving them this garbage.	4	March 4, 2021	8
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Norco (acetaminophen / hydrocodone) for Back Pain	M367 is garbage its works like crazy! Its really  hard  to find  Watson 853. Mallinckrodt is terrible garbage. Watson at least cured my pain I have stenosis  in the cervical/neck C5-6-7 plus L5-S1 Spondylosis hurting.  I don't feel any withdrawal from norco its a Good drug but you have to be careful my liver enzymes  go up. Watson  853 is the best one	9	March 1, 2021	7
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Pain	My pharmacy just started stocking KVK Tech hydrocodone.  Does anyone have experience with this brand?  Please report on the efficacy.	8	February 27, 2021	0
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Norco (acetaminophen / hydrocodone) for Back Pain	I've been on Norco on and off for 12 years. No withdrawal whatsoever I miss the Watson 853. The M367 is garbage got find the Watson or better generic in Walgreens. I need to find a little mom and pops shop because these ones feels like a placebo! I'm hurting with cervical Stenosis and Lumbar Spondylosis.	8	February 24, 2021	11
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Norco (acetaminophen / hydrocodone) for Back Pain	I actually respond well to Mallinckrodt M366 acetaminophen & hydrocodone for 2 years.  Walmart switched to Camber T258 which are useless even at a higher dose and impair sleep where M366 actually improved sleep if taken at the right time.  On a pain management contract so I guess changing pharmacies is only option. Now to see if they will disclose what they’re going to dispense before hand.	8	February 18, 2021	7
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Pain	The Malinckrodt generic norco 10/325 is utter rubbish! Shame on them and FDA. I’m glad I found this site so now I know it’s not in my head. I just wanted pain relief from dental surgery and what I got was nausea, headache and my stomach was so bad  I was literally rolling around in bed holding my stomach moaning. Not sure what’s worse the pain or the nausea and headache from these pills! All of us can’t be imagining this! These pills are poison!!!  SHAME ON ALL INVOLVED!!!!!!	1	February 14, 2021	9
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Pain	My recent refill is awful. The pills look different, I don't know who makes them, but as someone mentioned, they may as well be sugar pills. I can't sleep, my pain is not helped, and my hands are shaking.  Why does this so often happen? We are told this is the same med, but it clearly isn't.   Is there a way to find out if the one I took before this month still exist? I wish I knew the number, all I know is they are not the ones with T259 on them. Another bad generic is UO3.	7	February 11, 2021	9
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Back Pain	I’ve recently been placed back on acetaminophen/hydrocodone 10/325 by the VA as some pharmacist decided I was on something too strong to bring me in line with new guidelines set forth by DEA and CDC, on account of “Opioid Crises” with absolutely no regard for my trouble with pain.  VA uses Mallinckrodt generic which has always been the most worthless generic acetaminophen/hydrocodone on the market.  I suppose I could make it work if I took more than the recommended dose at a time but not going to.  Stay completely clear of Mallinckrodt as your wasting your money, I’ve know this for at least twenty years.	1	February 4, 2021	8
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Back Pain	I have been on pain medication for over 15 years, now the acetaminophen/hydrocodone don’t work, I have taken chamber, Rhodes, and a few more ! I am not sure what going on with this pain medication they use to work, every since the so called opiates abuse of pain medication these companies can do what ever they want, hope this helps someone.	3	February 3, 2021	17
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Norco (acetaminophen / hydrocodone) for Rheumatoid Arthritis	I've been taking Norco for 10 years I've never had a problem but my pharmacy changed to this pharmaceutical company mallinckrodt and I'm literally taking one pill every four hours and it still doesn't work it takes 30 to 40 minutes for it to take effect so I sit here in pain. it just seems that there's something wrong with this drug I've never had a problem before I don't have an addiction to these pills I've been very careful only to take them when I need them.	3	February 3, 2021	25
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Rheumatoid Arthritis	I have suffered with the pain of chronic RA for the last ten years. This past month the Walmart pharmacy switched my hydrocodone to the brand Camber. They offer zero pain relief. Honestly I took a baby aspirin they gave me more pain relief that the 10 mg acetaminophen/hydrocodone camber brand. Maybe if these pharmacies pharmacists suffered from RA they would start demanding the manufacturers of these junk generic brands be tested because they cannot have any opioid pain medication in them. Suffering in the mountains.	1	February 2, 2021	17
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Back Pain	I've been taking norco generic 7.5/325 for awhile now with the imprint IP115 (AvKare, Inc. brand)and for the most part they do help. I just got a new RX and these are wes302 (brand = Eywa Pharma Inc.), these do absolutely nothing for my back pain.  These are junk!	1	January 27, 2021	7
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Norco (acetaminophen / hydrocodone) for Pain	Train track worker 30+ years and am in pain - non cancer, non hospice palliative care pain. Stenosis.. Multiple Lumbar and thoracic disc nerve intrusions.. (herniated) Cervical Schmorls Nodes from the daily many hours of tool vibrations. Severe Heart Disease. High blood pressure from daily pain. What would happen if people on depression medication was cut off? Why are State Health Departments sending letters to doctors  treating people with legitimate pain that can be seen and proven from medical testing while they are responsible to guard the medication they take because it is life saving to warn doctors about their prescribing? Doctors will not tell you about those letters. My guess is because pain medications give legitimate people with proven pain quality of life and keep them out of revolving doors in the medical community where salaries are very high. People in pain need a good law firm to bring class action suit against profits before compassion.	3	January 24, 2021	86
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Back Pain	This medication is effective if your lucky enough to get the right brand or a good generic!!! T258 camber brand norco is junk ! They don’t work at all and Aurobindo is just as bad with horrible side effects !!! I have been on this medication for 15 + years I don’t see how this is allowed to pass QA. The  FDA  need to stop messing with people! They think switching formulas will stop over dosing when all it dose it hurt the people who truly need it. I personally am now gonna have to call pharmacy’s and look bad asking what brand they have because I refuse to have a 3rd month with CAMBER brand. I’ve been on several different brands again stay away from CAMBER and AUROBENDO it’s only side effects in a bottle with no pain reliever!	1	January 22, 2021	34

Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Pain	I've been taking this hydrocodone 10 for over 12 years now and last month my pharmacy gave me a generic brand made by a company called west. This didn't do anything to help with my pain but I can tell you what it caused. I started to have gallbladder and liver issues. I also couldn't move my bowels almost all month. Not to mention the constant sick feeling and falling asleep all day and night. 2 days ago I went for my refill and I got the same kind I used to get before this last time and within the last 2 days my liver and gallbladder is no longer hurting,  I don't have that sick feeling and I can stay awake all day now.	1	January 18, 2021	14
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Back Pain	"On this drug for 15 years for nerve damage. No problems until I received a fill with Mallinckrodt. Little relief, lots of side effects. Found ""better"" brands--these brands are just not the same as in the past (where did THEY go??), but at least they helped. Anytime something helps, it disappears at some point(?) Now I got a fill with Amneal -I hadn't tried those. (I NEVER paid attention to ""brands"" until Mallinckrodt! Any change before was seamless!!) Amneal has 0 pain relieving properties! Nothing but side effects in a bottle! Cannot take these for another 30 days! Nausea, sweating, HEADACHES- side effects++!  What works--anyone??? I have NEVER lost a script, lost my meds, sold my meds, had my meds stolen & I am writing this, so obviously I haven't OD'd!!! Does it matter? Apparently not. Living like this is NO life."	1	January 17, 2021	23
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Pain	The old yellow hydros with the checkmark were the best for helping my chronic pain. Now all pharmacies have the mallinckrodt M367 white ones which may as well be sugar pills. Very little effect if any, the government just can't stop hurting all of us who actually need pain medicine due to all the other people overdosing. No idea how the FDA hasn't done anything about this!!! Terrible!!	2	January 16, 2021	43
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Norco (acetaminophen / hydrocodone) for Back Pain	Norco just isn't the same. I get more pain relief with the added benefit of an anti-depressant with Tramadol and Tylenol and NSAIDS.	1	January 11, 2021	14
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Pain	The pills I'm reviewing have M365 printed on them; the label says 5-325 hydrocodone. I took hydrocodone after a hernia operation in 2007. I don't know the dose of hydrocodone but a single pill worked  within 30 mins. In fact, I reduced the dose by half. Today I had a mohs surgery on a forehead SCC (skin cancer). Once anesthesia wore off it it hurt to even blink. Two OTC tylenols had a minimal effect so I called the clinic and got these. I'm cautious and took a half a pill about three hours ago. Nothing. Then took the other half. Nothing. So far, I've taken 10mg over 3 hrs. Absolutely no effect; literally no effect. In fact, the wound is even more painful than ever. I was warned against aspirin and Advil b/c of bleeding risk. I'm astonished and wonder if the non-effect is in part what makes this drug so addictive. What a waste of time to drive to the clinic and fill the script. This drug has  absolutely no effect.	1	December 23, 2020	13
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Back Pain	I been taking Hydrocodone for 10 years to be able to work. I have had many manufacturers over the years unfortunately Amneal is the worse one for my pain. I literally have withdrawals and stomach aches switching to ur brand and still in severe pain! They don't work well compared to other manufacturers.. sorry!!	1	December 18, 2020	20
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Back Pain	I am so done with this generic hydrocodone. It does absolutely nothing for my pain and I don't understand how this medicine is even allowed on the market. There is no way in Hattiesburg there's more than 1 mg of hydrocodone in the 10 mg tablets. This stuff just makes me sick-ish and sleepy. Years ago it always worked, heck a half of one worked, now 2 won't even work. There is not one generic on the market today that is worth taking. If your doctor prescribes this for your pain you're pretty much going to suffer in pain like me and I know I'm not the only one as I know others who have had this med for pain issues and it didn't work for them either. Absolute garbage, the U.S. FDA is garbage as well to allow this.		December 18, 2020	40
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Norco (acetaminophen / hydrocodone) for Back Pain	Norco is a huge help for any chronic back pain, dental pain, and headaches.	10	December 16, 2020	15
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Back Pain	always got acetaminophen/hydrocodone m366's worked great for managing my pain. Then wally world filled my last RX with these t258 junk medication and snake oil. In the future  we all know we have two choices find a drug dealer for relief or the alternative.	3	December 15, 2020	25
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Back Pain	CVS was giving me the Lupin  acetaminophen/hydrocodone 325/10. Just 2 days ago I got my new prescription for the month. These are from Novel laboratories. Has n 358 on the white oval pill. Lupin bought Novel in 2015. So whats up with this? The pills do not work at all. Just make me drowsy and want to sleep. I don't want anymore generics!! I will pay extra to get the Watson brand.	1	December 14, 2020	22
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Back Pain	I’ve been taking Percocet 10/325’s almost continuously since 2012. I’ve had 3 back surgeries including 2 fusions. I never had any problems with my medication until my pharmacy began dispensing the Lupin manufacturer, pill identifier n493. I began suffering what I now realize were withdrawal symptoms. Horrible, nonstop drenching sweats, stomach problems, severe joint pain, and no pain relief. I discussed with my doctor and he tried requesting brand name only. Unfortunately, I cannot afford $2,000 a month for my Rx so this was not an option. My Costco pharmacy advised me that this was their preferred manufacturer and I had no choice but to take what they dispensed. And, if I call around to other pharmacies I’ll be looked at as a drug seeking pharmacy shopper (even though I’ve been taking my medication responsibly, and without exceeding the prescribed dosage for 8 years). So, my only choice is to roll the dice each month and pray I don’t get Lupin.	4	December 14, 2020	16
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Pain	The generics acetaminophen/hydrocodone make you so drained, no pain relief,  so awful.  Why can't the pharmacies carry the Brand names anymore,  no freedom of choice.	1	December 12, 2020	28
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Pain	The generic acetaminophen/hydrocodone is HORRIBLE this doesn't work! If I could,  I would give it a Zero	1	December 8, 2020	25
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Xodol (acetaminophen / hydrocodone) for Pain	This combination of 300 mg acetaminophen and 10 mg hydrocodone works best to suppress pain from kidney stones while interfering the least with sleeping.  Other Vicodin combinations have odd side effects like itching and “sleep skimming” (no deep sleep).   This pain reliever works best for me.  Always needs to be taken before pain level becomes too high!	10	November 28, 2020	7
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Lortab (acetaminophen / hydrocodone) for Pain	I was on this medicine Lortab back in 2016, 2017 then onto oxycodone by early 2018. But my advise is for y'all to try Liquid lortab aka hycet instead of the pills plus there is 7% of Alcohol per dose. I think its 5mg/5ml and 7.5mg/10ml,  10mg/15ml if im not mistaken. Works far more better than the tablets.	7	November 21, 2020	11
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Norco (acetaminophen / hydrocodone)	Question I am so lost. So I get hydrocodone 10 mg every month. Well I noticed if I get white pills from CVS they work perfectly, but if I get yellow v3601 10mg they do absolutely nothing. I made this mistake 2 times when dr asked me if I get my meds from heb pharmacy I said yes which was a mistake because this is second time I got pills from there and they do nothing for me. I get white ones and I definitely feel it   working. People keep telling me its same pill just different manufacturers but I know the yellow ones have some different ingredients in it		November 15, 2020	47
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Cough	I have a cough off and on for 5 weeks. No over the counter cough syrup works. I am using Vicks, humidifier and vaporizer. Also, warm liquids and stay out of cold and windy weather.  When I eat food or talk my cough is aggravated and chest hurts. I take 5-325 hydrocodone-acetaminophen and drink 2 bottles of water to clear throat.		November 10, 2020	2
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Norco (acetaminophen / hydrocodone) for Back Pain	For those saying Watson no longer makes their generic norco...... your wrong. Just picked it up for a disabled friend yesterday and it’s Watson.  Don’t know why you’d want it tho. Every time I’ve ever taken Watson norco within twenty minutes I’m vomiting.		November 7, 2020	31
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Norco (acetaminophen / hydrocodone) for Pain	I have extreme pain from a tooth and my dentist prescribed me Norco and I thought the excruciating pain will finally end. This stuff is complete garbage. I usually have to take lower doses due to sensitivity and this was a full dose. It did absolutely nothing for pain. The only thing it did was make me a tiny bit tired, but Tris needs to figure out what they are doing. DO NOT use this for pain relief, ibuprofen does a lot better.	1	November 4, 2020	27
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Pain	AUROBINDO worked great and fast 10 for generic. I recently received something/tech brand 10/325 and it was junk and hard to break in half. I've had others that just weren't effective? and usually hard to break in half.	10	November 3, 2020	9
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Cough	"I have had a chronic cough for more than 10 years. Had many xrays, tests and scopes. Was told allergies...tried inhalers and allergy meds. Tore out carpet in house. Nothing has worked. Doctor has no solutions for me. Now during COVID19 I'm constantly having to say ""I've had this cough for 10 years. I can clear out a store with my cough. The only thing ever stopped my cough was when I was on Norco for a knee replacement. My cough stopped the day of surgery and no cough until the day I ended Norco. I am a person that does not like to take meds. But if I could get the doctor to prescribe a very small amount that works, I would take it. This cough is annoying and keeps me from sleeping. Many times I've told my husband he may want to sleep in the guest room so I don't disturb his sleep."	10	October 23, 2020	21
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Norco (acetaminophen / hydrocodone) for Back Pain	I was on norco over 10 years, seems all it began to do was make me sleep. Dr switched me to percocet 10mg, better at alleviating pain but still causes sleepiness. He switched me to oxycodone 10mg seems to work better for me.	7	October 19, 2020	19
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Pain	Those with concerns regarding current generic pain medications are not imagining anything. After a gunshot left me with debilitating pain close to 20 years ago, I was hesitant to began opioid therapy. I was initially given numerous non-opiate meds to try and control the pain (Elavil, Neurontin, etc). After a few years, I ultimately ended up being prescribed Norco 10/325. Norco 10/325 worked wonders for me for years. All of a sudden, around the end of 2017, I filled my prescription and was notified that the pharmacy carries a new “manufacturer’s” brand. Ok, I thought no big deal, right? Well, it was a very big deal. That first generic I tried did zero except make me nauseous, so I changed pharmacies. The 2nd generic just made me feel weird & anxious. I stuck with the 3rd generic, Mallinckrodt, which is ok sometimes (very hit & miss, no stability). My physician has offered to prescribe me stronger meds, and despite my hesitation, I may need to change. Best of luck to you all!	5	October 4, 2020	48
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Norco (acetaminophen / hydrocodone) for Back Pain	I screwed up my back pretty bad in 1993. The older I get the worse the pain. Surgery in NOT an option.. Used to get Watson and Qualitest brand acetaminophen/hydrocodone for the pain. It worked great. Then the pharmacies switched to Mallinckrodt.  It either didn't work, made me itch or gave me severe breathing problems depending upon the lot number.  My doctor switched me to Percocet.  It didn't work at ALL!  Then I checked the manufacturer. Mallinckrodt.   If you can find a pharmacy the doesn't use Mallinckrodt...run, do not walk, to that pharmacy.  I've had it with Mallinckrodt.	1	September 26, 2020	103
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Lortab (acetaminophen / hydrocodone) for Back Pain	I've been taking lortab for over 30+yrs... It's not helping my pain at all now. I've had 7 back surgeries which helped but not for long. I need advice on what else I can take. I've got a pain management. I need some help	2	September 25, 2020	28
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Cough	I discover my chronic cough goes away within 15 minutes with a small  dose of Norco. It last for 6 hours. Been taking it for 15 years. Never have to increase the dose. I have tried everything the ENT ,  lung specialist, allergy doc etc . Once a year I stop for a couple months to see if will go away and it’s always there. Im 67 years old, and if they ever take it alway , I will go to the streets to get my cough under total control. It’s seems like it has such a bad connotation, but it works! I get my liver tested twice a year . So far so good. I have tried  inhalers, and have around ten different meds which didn’t even touch my cough.	10	September 21, 2020	12
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Norco (acetaminophen / hydrocodone) for Back Pain	"For years I took brand Norco (acetaminophen/hydrocodone) when it was manufactured by Watson.  When the drug went off patent, many companies jumped in to manufacture generic versions of the drug.  At one time, Watson was manufacturing a generic, which was great, since it was exactly the same as the brand, but Watson was bought out, and it's impossible to know (except through trial and error) whether the purchaser is using the Watson ""recipe.""   As for generics acetaminophen with hydrocodone, for me, the generic Norco manufactured by Aurobindo has been excellent, as has that manufactured by Mallinckrodt and Rhodes.  I have also been able to take the generic manufactured by Tris with what is usually adequate pain relief (but not as good as Aurobindo, Mallinckrodt or Rhodes).  The generic that I absolutely cannot take is Amneal - it's like not taking anything at all.  I'm not sure why, as all of these drugs should have the same amount of opiate in them, but I might as well not fill the prescription if the generic is Amneal."	9	September 12, 2020	68
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Vicodin (acetaminophen / hydrocodone) for Rheumatoid Arthritis	I have been prescribed vicodin for RA and fibromyalgia it helps so much. I can get up and almost live a normal life without drowsiness as get with Gapapentin	10	September 10, 2020	13
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Lortab (acetaminophen / hydrocodone) for Back Pain	Lortab gave me very little, if any, pain relief. Have been successfully treated with 10/325 hydrocodone for 3 years. This manufacturer pills don't help.	1	September 9, 2020	17
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Back Pain	I’ve had multiple back surgeries, fusions with hardware a few months back.  The past 2 months CVS changed to Lupin acetaminophen/hydrocodone 10mg.  I’ve had no relief from this medication and went through withdrawals for a couple days.  I actually thought I had COVID but tested negative.  I found hydrocodone in my medicine cabinet from my last surgery that I tried and had solid pain relief for almost 6 hours.  Whatever these manufacturers are putting on the market is complete garbage.  I’m going back to my doctor Tuesday to see if she can switch me to oxycodone or change to a brand name.	1	September 6, 2020	50
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Rheumatoid Arthritis	I have been on acetaminophen with hydrocodone for 6 years and just in the last 2 weeks I got a refill with Amneal brand pills, I thought it was the end of me. Had to switch to 1/2s and then was spacing them 9 hours apart but would become loopy, headache and no pain relief but a high which was NOT enjoyable, and a heart rate that wouldn't slow. Has anyone felt like this on the Amneal brand of acetaminophen with hydrocodone?	1	September 3, 2020	17
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Back Pain	I've taken this drug generic  for norco (acetaminophen/hydrocodone) for many years and I don't know what they have them, they are not the same drug.  Throw them in the trash. I wanted to get them tested to see what was in them but they said because I was on medicare and could not.  They signed a contract.  They did not want to be liable.  Be careful be aware. This is not what they say it is.		August 30, 2020	39
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Vicodin (acetaminophen / hydrocodone) for Back Pain	After an injury a I got a prescription for 60 tablets of Vicodin. The old class I mean. 500/5. After one tablet I felt almost no relief. After tho Vicodins my pain goes away within 30 minutes. I am pain free for good 5 hours. I feel a little happy, drowsy.. constipated a little.	10	August 27, 2020	15
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Pain	I have taken lortab for chronic pain for many years and had to start using cvs for my medicines and used Walgreens previously but never gotten sick from the lortabs until now and have been so sick taking it . It has gotten hung up in my throat and made my stomach have belches and nauseated. Novel laboratories is who makes the Kieran for CVS.  Just be aware they are different.	3	August 26, 2020	20
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Pain	I’ve been using hydrocodone for many years for chronic pain.  This time I got a refill, I took one and it’s like I threw it in the trash.  What’s up?  I usually only need one a day but I have to take two in order to get some relief.  I plan on complaining to the pharmacy.	1	August 26, 2020	42
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Vicodin (acetaminophen / hydrocodone) for Back Pain	8 years ago I had discectomy surgery on my L5-S1 disc. The surgeon was hopeful that I wouldn’t need additional surgery. 8 years later I ruptured the same disc. I live with excruciating pain every day especially during the evening hours when my back has said that it’s finally had enough for the day. I take the Vicodin only in the evening and it help tremendously. I’m also taking Gabapentin and Baclofen. The combination of these medications makes my life bearable. However, if I miss taking the meds on schedule then I’m in severe pain. The Vicodin works amazingly. The only issue I have with it is that it wakes me up and makes me feel more aware and motivated. At night this can be a difficult thing because I then want to work on projects and get things done. Sometimes I don’t go to bed until the early hours and that’s not good for my health. Otherwise I think Vicodin is a wonderful pain reliever for my back pain and sciatica.	10	August 26, 2020	19
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Norco (acetaminophen / hydrocodone) for Pain	Fibro, CF, deg.arthritis, bilateral TJR of jaw. Have side effects to most meds, Norco works best. Generic Norco quality declined substantially since 2017. Used to take Qualitest generic 10/325 worked great, then Watson. Mallinckrodt, awful, did I mention AWFUL? Felt as I took nothing, nausea, & dizziness. Tried Par brand bad as Mallinckrodt. Dr. documents chart about lack of effectiveness of generic brands. Called small pharmacy, asked to order brand name Norco. Did this w/out any hassle or judgment.Costs $500 /100 , Rx is 180/ month. I pay $10 or less for generics. Good news brand name Norco works great, no side effects, pain 8 goes down to 3-4. Bad news can't afford. Req. ins co. cover, have documented generics give no pain relief. Think generic fillers are poor quality, & is why don't work for a lot of us in pain. Assume brand name have better quality fillers. It's unfair we have sub-par meds. Not all generics work as well as brand names, as they claim. Brand: Allergan, white, oblong, NORCO 539.	9	August 25, 2020	102
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Norco (acetaminophen / hydrocodone) for Pain	The generic hydrocodone/ acetaminophen combo has turned into absolute garbage in the US. In my experience pharmacies are just purchasing the cheapest product they can find, which increases all the bad effects of an opioid while providing very little pain relief. Opioids are the only drug class you can't even pay extra for the name brand for, all thanks to pharmacy/insurance company policy. It is absurd. Honestly, it should be illegal. Luckily my doctor is willing to switch me to percocet or oxy (which is almost impossible in todays age) so I'm glad. On the other hand I seem to have a weirdly high tolerance to oxy. Either way report this to the drug manufacturers (mallinckrodt, Tris, etc) is the only way. The FDA is filled people who don't answer the phone, so reporting to the manufacturers as well is best.	2	August 23, 2020	72
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Pain	I am a hard working citizen. I do not do recreational drugs or drink alcohol and yet I feel like I’m being treated like a vagrant getting the same medication I’ve been getting for years.  The pharmacies are making it harder and harder , they push out refill dates every time , sometimes for weeks with the same excuse “Oh sorry our shipment didn’t come in”.   Oh sorry! They aren’t the ones suffering in pain trying to make it through the day.  Then they use Cheap products  like the brand LUPIN. It’s awful.   It gives me headaches, blurred vision, and dehydration. It’s worse than Aurobindo.   I call, and call and call and and do tons of legwork on my own to make sure the pharmacist orders the right mfg and they get it wrong.   I physically talk face to face and they still get it wrong. So at this point it feels intentional.   The street users and addicts make it so horrible for the people who really need to use it to function.   This has to change. :(	2	August 7, 2020	101
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Rheumatoid Arthritis	I can tell you right now the Mallinckrodt  hydrocodone has been changed ! I don’t think there is anything in them for pain , I believe they are taking it off market. I, for one, don’t know what I’m going to do. I’m 60 I’ve had 5 back surgeries, 1 neck surgeries I have been in pain for 13 years and have been taking the same dose  for just as long !  I’m sick to my stomach , puke , I’ve had a cluster headache for over two months, dizzy, gain weight , tired all the time ! Why would the government do this to people that truly need this medication. I’m not a kid sneaking pills out of the medicine cabinet ! I wish I knew who to call about Mallinckrodt ! This stuff is nasty I’m worried there is something going into it that could really hurt us ! My god what can we do ?	2	July 24, 2020	85
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Rheumatoid Arthritis	I’ve been taking the generic Vicodin’s 7.5/ 325 for 15 years failed back surgeries. Walgreens is my pharmacy they changed brands from Watson to Mallinckrot and never told me I noticed I was sick to my stomach all the time and headaches tired , I didn’t know what the heck was going on. I got a refill on my inhaler they changed that, so I just looked at my pills what the heck they changed them too and didn’t tell me ! Damn now I have to deal with this for a month ! The pharmacist tried to tell me there is no difference in them and that just ticks me off , I don’t like being told something I know better !	3	July 24, 2020	51
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Back Pain	The experience is with Narco 10/325, and over the past few years I've complained to the pharmacy my doctor about the different effects that I'm experiencing from month to month. Born affected by Polio my biggest issue is hip pain but the medication is creating issues with a previously broken ankle, causing pain to that area same for a hurt knee. But the greatest problem from swelling in my feet, ankles and lower legs, and too the point of creating difficulties walking and stability. This is a continuous side effect when taking the medication. Summer months I can only help my pain with ibuprofen causing great stomach discomfort even if I eat before. But after about 4 days or so nearly all the symptoms from taking the Narco 10/325 knockoff is just about gone except for the burning stinging of my feet which I fear may become permanent. My doctor thinks I'm just creating this in my head.	4	July 22, 2020	24
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Pain	I have pain from  Failed back surgery. I've found a WALGREENS  in Illinois that will special order the par brand of acetaminophen/hydrocodone (qualitiest) Norco 10/325 for me.  These are the LAST of the yellow acetaminophen/hydrocodone, and as such the last that work. (Unless you want to send insane money on name brand Norco).  Also, I used to be on Fentanyl patches, and this same Walgreens ordered Sandoz brand Fentanyl.  Sandoz is manufactured in the same facility and on the same line as name Brand Duragesic.  The point being here, if you can make friends with your local Walgreens pharmacy manager, they can order a LOT of the specialty generic brands that are so much more effective then the IP 109/110 or the M367 garbage that every other pharmacy seems to dispense.  I don't think Watson even manufactures Norco anymore.	8	July 17, 2020	43
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Back Pain	Watch out for kvk-tech, inc brand of acetaminophen/hydrocodone. They have numerous warnings and fines. Because the CVS here doesn't know how to read, I'm stuck with almost a full script of 750s that don't do anything but make you sick as a dog. When are pharmacies and drs going to return?  Or should we invest more in Canada and trust their version of the FDA.	1	July 8, 2020	48
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Norco (acetaminophen / hydrocodone) for Pain	I was diagnosed with Connective Tissue Disease about 9 years ago. Up until a couple years ago, I got excellent relief from a yellow generic Norco 5 325. It didn't always relieve all the pain but that's OK. I changed pharmacies twice now in hope of  getting a product that made my life liveable. All I've gotten has been this ineffective m365. I took one over 2 hours ago and now do I finely feel like moving around, a big difference from getting relief in 20-30 minutes. The FDA is clearly negligent. They don't test generics for effectiveness at all. This witch hunt on Hydrocodone is a joke, with responsible hard working Americans paying the price in pain because of  the who obtain these drugs illegally. The FDA just recently decided that cigars needed to be tested at $100k  per test, but they refuse to test prescription medications prescribed by responsible care givers to tax paying Americans.	3	July 2, 2020	120
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Pain	The 10 mg HydrocodoneAccetaminopen 10mg 325 has lost its relief for my Legs and Lower back pain. It only takes the edge off for about 1-1/2 hours. I’m laying down a majority of the time as that is the only way to get any relief at all	1	June 28, 2020	20

Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Lortab (acetaminophen / hydrocodone) for Back Pain	This is by far the worst brand of hydrocodone I have ever taken. Makes me sick to my stomach and does not on my back pain at all. And it's a waste of a prescription. Watson brand is by far the best with no side effects and does its job. I do not know what fillers you're putting in this junk but you need to take it off the market. I had to change my pharmacy to get a brand that works because of your side effects of this junk. I couldn't be more serious. I'm after pain relief not a high and certainly not to be sick at my stomach from taking it.	1	June 15, 2020	61
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Pain	This acetaminophen/hydrocodone camber brand yellow pill with the number T259 (325 mg/10 mg). This must have come from the  black market, because it is worthless.  I have to stay in pain all month long. It is wrong to have your insurance pay for this pill. No more for me. I have to find out what is in this pill. My pain is too great. Camber fix this medication.	1	June 10, 2020	49
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Norco (acetaminophen / hydrocodone) for Rheumatoid Arthritis	This Mallinckrodt  acetaminophen/hydrocodone generic Norco is absolute rubbish! I've complained to my doctor, to the pharmacy, to the FDA too many times to count, and to the company itself. I'm at my wit's end in pain! What is going on and how are they getting away with this? For 5 years I've been on this medication and when it was Watson brand it worked fine, didn't take away all the pain but it was better than what I am experiencing now!  I'm seriously thinking about asking my doctor to switch me from 10 mg to 5 mg because someone said they worked great, maybe it's just the 10's that are junk. Tonight I am ordering some drug tests just to see if anything shows up because honest to god I am almost 100% positive there is not any active ingredients in the Mallinckrodt 10 mg. Why should I be crying in pain after taking 2???? ENOUGH. I am in the process of getting a chemical analysis of my medication.  	1	June 9, 2020	230
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Rheumatoid Arthritis	I suffer from rheumatoid arthritis and have been on Hydrocodone 10/325 for about 2 years, and when the generics stopped working, or made me sick, this website helped me find a brand that works.  First, my bad experience was with Lupin (severe nausea and headache with little pain relief) and Mallinckrodt (which used to work but a few months ago stopped being effective).  The yellow pills with the V on them are the only ones that work, they are made by Qualitest, which is now Par pharmaceuticals.  None of the big retail pharmacy chains will order them.  I called several local pharmacies until I found one who will order them and keep them in stock for me.  They’re only open 5 days a week and I have to drive about 35-40 minutes round trip to get them, but it’s worth it.  I hope this can help others, and thank you to those of you who recommended this brand to me.  I finally have my quality of life back.	9	June 8, 2020	78
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Rheumatoid Arthritis	I have all the problems that everyone has with pain meds I feel the pain. I’ve been taking acetaminophen/hydrocodone 10/325 for years and switch between brands etc. But definitely the power in them has dropped. I’m taking m367 and gives me more of an itch than the relief. I need my pain meds to work I pay big bucks for my blue cross blue shield 4 meds and I argue wit my pharmacist bout this but goes nowhere. I talk for all patients like I heard they all worried about over dose, addiction and such. 	3	June 7, 2020	39
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Norco (acetaminophen / hydrocodone) for Back Pain	The generic norco if today will be ineffective due to the abuse deterrence altering the effectiveness of the pain pill.

Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Back Pain	I have chronic back pain from an injury to 5th lumbar region.  I had back surgery in 1997.  The surgery gave me pain relief for two years, and that was it.  Now my entire back hurts from top to bottom with pain going down left leg.  I have been taking hydrocodone since 2003, and it has always worked for me.  Giving me enough pain relief to live an active life.  Within the last two years I have noticed that the hydrocodone wasn't taking away my pain like it use to.  Now it doesn't work at all.   My last prescription was Tris PHARMA brand.  This medication is comparable to Mallinckrodt brand.  I have nausea, ringing in ears, headaches, and severe dizziness.  I feel like I am going to fall over when I get up.   Is there anyone out there who can help us?  Who represents the people who have to take pain medications to live?  My quality of life is now gone.

I have back issues(need surgery), an ankle that I had surgery on several years ago that gives me problems all the time and severe arthritis in my hands. I also have a bad left knee and rt. rotator cuff issues. My body is just beat up and worn out. Biggest reason is from being a Registered Nurse in the hospital setting for 20 years. Anyway, I noticed a change in the medication first time about a year ago. Then again about 3 months ago. The change(s) are VERY NOTABLE!!  I have nausea, ringing in ears, less pain relief and dizziness so bad I feel like I have vertigo (which I don't..I had that checked). It is the Mallinckrodt mgfr. The fact they change the formulas on medications and don't let people know is terrible. Whether its dosage of the pain medication in it or fillers, it could potentially be a fatal issue if someone has allergy. The street addicts..ones that take any and everything to get high, has ruined true pain sufferers lives!!!	5	May 21, 2020	103
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Rheumatoid Arthritis	Been taking this med acetaminophen/hydrocodone for about a year for RA and  sometimes I believe its nothing but a placebo, and it does nothing, while other times it seem to help the pain.	3	May 15, 2020	33
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Norco (acetaminophen / hydrocodone) for Back Pain	Been on Norco 7.5/325 for 4 years . Had Spinal Fusion L4-S1 will never be the same . Norco has given me my life back . I am taking the Generic Version . For those of you complaining it DOES work . Be thankful you can get any Narcotics in todays world. They could say 800mgs of ibuprofen. Be thankful you are alive and kicking . Im 62 .	10	May 15, 2020	59
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Norco (acetaminophen / hydrocodone) for Back Pain	2 years agoI went to Walgreens instead of CVS and got my prescription filled  that month for Norco 10 / 325 it was a pill look like my yellow ones little football but it was white. Absolutely  did not work. I'm 67 years old and I had a horrible car accident 23 years ago and with the help of Norco I live with the pain. The last few years they're screwing with the medicine - everybody - not just Walgreens, Walgreens is the worst by the way. I believe that they are no longer putting opiate in their pills I mean if you get a 10 / 325 you shouldn't be able to break it so easily, used to be so hard to break that little yellow pill in half. I mean a lot of us are in pain if you're in pain why should we have to live in pain I don't get it. Somebody needs to do something I mean if anyone wants to go in together we find out how much it cost to test them I'll go in one way to find out	3	May 10, 2020	173
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Rheumatoid Arthritis	I have been on Vicodin, Norco, Hydrocodone-Acetaminophen off and on for about 11 years with RA, PA, AS, fibromyalgia, spinal stenosis, DDD, neuropathy...well let’s just say my spine is a mess and causing the rest of my body problems.   I was on Watson brand at first 5/500 and even 7.5/750 and they worked great and I only took one every 8 hours, even though I was prescribed 1 every 6. In the last year or so I was switched to U03 I have noticed that I am taking them every 6 and I’m even taking my Neurontin (gabapentin 300) more often than I was.  I really do agree with a lot of the reviews that there is a new formula or something being implemented by the FDA because I can take one and barely feel the relief I always used to. I know its taking the edge off, so I know its got something in it!	4	May 1, 2020	52
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Pain	My GYN prescribed this for me on 4/2/20, for ovarian cysts as he's done a couple of other times in the past, when the ER doesn't want to help with pain control. I'm in pain management & despite my pain Dr ok'ing me receiving pain meds in emergency situations,  from Dr's other than him, some ER Dr's don't want to be bothered with my quality of life & doing the right thing . In the past, I'm not sure who the manufacturer was, but, it was effective.  With this particular brand, Mallinckrodt, it's not as effective & I've noticed it feels like I've taken some sort of sedative. This hasn't happened before & when I looked this up & found these reviews, I knew I had to share my experience.  I also looked up Mallinckrodt & read where they've been in some legal trouble for ethical behavior concerning another one of their meds, so, I wouldn't be surprised if they weren't putting the correct doses of ingredients in these.	3	April 4, 2020	71
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Back Pain	Due to a severe back injury I've been on Norco for years.. Long ago, my pharmacies carried Qualitest and Watson (dark yellow) brand. Worked great!  Over the years, however, now they only carry Mallinckrodt brand.  This stuff is hit or miss. I've also noticed that the Mallinckrodt brand is not only hit or miss, but I've developed an allergic reaction to the brand.  Sometimes it causes itching and scratching, sometimes severe respiratory problems, or it doesn't work at all. My doctor says that I'm not the only one with this problem.  Interesting.  Has anyone else had these problems, or is it just me?	5	April 4, 2020	156
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Pain	Mallinckrodt Brand don’t work!	1	April 4, 2020	77
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Rheumatoid Arthritis	I could tell a difference the first tablet I took; it gave me a stomach ache and made me feel almost lethargic after an hour or so. I thought my condition was maybe getting worse. I stopped taking the prescribed amount and just use it when needed; I felt awful for weeks. I got my new prescription of a different brand m365 and OMG I feel like me again without the side effects of this drug. I will be sure to let the pharmacy know that I can not take this brand to many different side effects.	1	March 25, 2020	52
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Lortab (acetaminophen / hydrocodone) for Pain	This pill didn't do much of anything before but now days they do even less. Are they doing something to the pain meds so that they are not consistent ever.!!! Some months you get a script that's amazing an other times they make you feel so bad your head hurts an etc. But the feds and gov have there hands in every thing so I'm sure there knocking everything off so can't trust any of them anymore. It is  nothing like it use to be...	1	March 17, 2020	95
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Pain	10 years of taking these with little problems and just refilled and I have been bleeding out of nose and mouth and urine since getting a new batch of medication.  Dr is too worried about the bleeding and I am in pain, what is in these pills.	1	March 14, 2020	37
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Back Pain	Cambra acetaminophen/hydrocodone yellows t257 not effective. Lots of fillers causing side effects. Reported to rite aid, optum Rx, cambra and fda.   Also people who comment if possible mention the pill ID number. There are many generics.	8	March 13, 2020	61
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Back Pain	Just got my script of generic  Norco (acetaminophen & hydrocodone) made by tris pharmacy has no pain relief properties whatsoever.  I used to get the ones that said ip110 (Amneal Pharmaceuticals) at least they worked am gonna just throw these away	1	March 9, 2020	47
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Pain	"""I have a history of Colon Cancer and bowel obstructions which has lead into scar tissue. Also have had two total hip replacements along with other chronic pain issues. Dr. put me on Percocet...generic for Mallinckrodt. I have been on this brand for over 10 years. Have gotten my pain level down to a 3. Now Kaiser Permanente no longer dispenses this brand. Two month ago got the CAMBER brand. THIS pain medication is JUNK!! Gives me severe migraines and l want to throw up!! Have to counteract this CAMBER with other medications. Have called Mallincodt and they say that Kaiser pharmacy has to have a contract with them. Have filled a complaint with CAMBER and now with the AMA. Dr. said that if l could find the Mallinckrodt brand that he would give me a written triplicate to get this brand. Need assistance to find this brand. Thanks and God Bless""."	1	March 8, 2020	35
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Back Pain	Yeah I'm on this Malkincrodt acetaminophen/hydrocodone 10-325 for a  bad back. Ex-contractor.  This brand feels like completely worthless fake pills. Sick of sitting here in pain. Someone needs to sue these jerks. I asked the pharmacy. There's no other brands they carry. Because they want control of your life! I'm sick of it!	1	March 8, 2020	77
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Lorcet HD (acetaminophen / hydrocodone)	"The past 3 or 4 months, every time I pick up my meds (10mg-325 hydrocodone with acetaminophen) it hasn't been working. I had the one imprinted with  U03  (Aurolife Pharma LLC) when I started to notice I was having to double up due to the lack of effectiveness. So, I asked for a different manufacturer. I recently received white oval with imprint 176 by the mnft ""Caraco Sun pharm"" they are even worse!! I usually take 1 every 4 or 5 hours, these I've literally take  2 at ONCE and NO relief. This whole scandal is rubbish, what are we supposed to do as the patient for a resolution?? Seriously!"	1	March 1, 2020	66
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Pain	I just got a script yesterday for the 1st time for these  generic pills acetaminophen & hydrocodone. I've been taking 10/325 Norco's for over 6 years due to all my health issue's along with Oxycontin. I totally feel the difference with these pills. The yellow one's actually are the best I have ever taken ,but these are garbage like everyone is saying. I just don't know how to file a complaint? Good luck everyone!	2	February 29, 2020	58
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Rheumatoid Arthritis	Ok so i agree with everyone about the changes to the pain pill formula.  I have tried RP, and Mallinckrodt brand and they do absolutely nothing as far as giving me the overall pain relief.  No real relief as they had before like Watson.  Mallinckrodt used to be good but that was a long time ago.  It’s almost like - might as well take an Aleve and a Tylenol.  Problem with that is I have to take a lot of those often and then my kidneys and liver are hurting.  Trashed my body even more.  Mallinckrodt is better pain relief but nothing much better than Tylenol.  There may be some formula out there to avoid the euphoria effect but without triggering that, it doesn't offer any of the pain benefits.  Kind of like - have to have both or you get an alternative that does not actually work.  But. Then people don't overdose so I get that also...  Might be good for the addicts to stop but when I can't open a jar without excruciating pain or lift my arm, something has to give here.  These brands all suck!!	1	February 28, 2020	54
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Back Pain	My medicine was recalled back to Rhodes and Parma pharmaceuticals for testing I am having all the above complaints somethings changed heart racing, no relief, valve problems lethargic, zombie, headaches it’s like the chain on medicine that doesn’t work will relay updates later thank you	2	February 27, 2020	47
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Pain	Anyone given cambra t257 generic for Norco. Not effective filed complaint with fda and cambra. Mallinkckrodt works for me	1	February 26, 2020	24
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Back Pain	Listen all...QUALITEST brand of acetaminophen with hydrocodoneis ONLY generic that works...yellow pills.  Just go to a local pharmacy and request them to carry.	10	February 24, 2020	61
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Back Pain	"I was prescribed ""Hydrocodone/Acedeminiphen 7.5- 3.25"" for Sciatic Pain & Fibromyalgia Pain. I have been taking this medication for quite some time and it works/worked, until Walgreens, switched manufacturers, going from ""Watson"" to ""Mallinckrodt"". This  pain med has so much filler and hardly any actual pain reliever in it. I've had to take/use more to get any relief; And that makes me look like I'm abusing/misusing my prescriptions. This company is really doing us a disservice, not to mention being dishonest & fraudulent. I asked a couple of Pharmacist if anyone else has complained about this medication ( from this manufacturer) not working for them? He said there had indeed been other complaints. Mallinckrodt Pharmaceutical products  are on the same level as Placebos. This is so unfair, when we are suffering with legitimate pain. I am pleading with Walgreens, Walmart & other Pharmacies to Stop buying from this company. We Need Real Meds. This Patient/Consumer is calling them out!"	1	February 22, 2020	90
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Lorcet HD (acetaminophen / hydrocodone) for Back Pain	This pain medicine does Not Work!!! I was taking Norco which is much better! Couldn’t even tell I had taken anything!	1	February 22, 2020	23
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Back Pain	Past six months can't find any other brand of  acetaminophen and hydrocodone but these new pills by Malinckrodt and similar.  Definitely this is the government and big pharma trying to curb the opioid epidemic without telling anyone. Who can afford a lawyer big enough to dig into this? Cardinal health is now a 50-50 partner with CVS and Cardinal regulates what drugs get distributed to all pharmacies.  I heard this from two pharmacists directly. They took away their right to choose order specific manufacturers.  Imagine the money they're making by not even putting the active ingredient in these pills and selling them for the same price.  They know that you're going to be treated as if you're a drug addict if you say anything. The only recourse you do have is to complain through the proper channels. That's about like saying you want your tax rate lowered for your income bracket!  Unfortunately people with true chronic pain issues are suffering because they don't fix the issue of addiction	3	February 21, 2020	63
Acetaminophen and Hydrocodone	Pain	Punish the heroin not pain meds.  Ridiculous that this is even happening.  Some people rely on it just to work and have any quality of life.	10	February 21, 2020	73
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Chronic Pain	I've been on pain medication for a very long time now once you've been on them for awhile you can pretty much tell the difference of what works for you and what doesn't. I take oxycodone 10mg and my pharmacy gets Mallinckrodt, they do work for me but sometimes it seems like something is missing. It is saddening to see these comments how there are companies repeatedly having the same complaints and yet nothing is being done about this. Anyways I can relate to a lot of these complaints on here and especially when these pharmacies make you feel like you've done something wrong by asking for a different brand and being made to feel like you're some kind of drug seeker. I feel for you and I'm hoping and praying that things will turn around some day	10	April 25, 2021	1
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Chronic Pain	At first I was getting brand, then my medical company said too expensive and I started the yellow 10/325mg - they worked ok. Then the market was flooded with the white, generic, from who knows where, and its totally ineffective! What recourse do I have? I can't afford  $2,000.00 per month for brand acetaminophen/oxycodone.	1	April 14, 2021	5
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Chronic Pain	RP10/325 white oxycodone, made by Rhodes pharm. are highly ineffective for the treatment of pain, this medication should be removed off the market.  It causes stomach problems, irritability and sleepiness.  It really has only added to and aggravated my pain rather than helping to manage it.  I don't know if it is the hydrochloride or what but this the worst pain medication ever and I will be taking mostly motrin this month and avoiding being active in an effort to manage my pain until my pharmacy gets my more regular brand of prescribed pain medications and will only take one of these horrible ineffective pills at bedtime to ensure I dont suffer with opioid withdrawals so that I can go to work.  This is all that this medication is good for, is simply to ensure that you don't get withdrawal symptoms until next month when I can get a decent brand of medication again.	1	April 5, 2021	13
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Chronic Pain	I've been going to same pharmacy for about 5 years now.  I was paying $16 for 90 10/325 oxycodone.  I'm now paying $49..seems pharmacy doesn't always have my brand which works best for me the one with the imprint U17 by Aurolife Pharma LLC, my pharmacist is aware of this. Upon refilling my script yesterday, they did not have any, so I had to settle for the T194 (Camber Pharma). This brand is awful,  and on top of that,  they sorted me 2..next month when I refill, I'll call my pharmacy to make sure they have the U17, if not, I'm changing pharmacies.	4	April 1, 2021	8
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Percocet (acetaminophen / oxycodone) for Pain	"12 years ago I helped a so-called friend move a a tablesaw and  that thing weighed 200lbs I weighed 150lbs, the problem was he dropped it and next thing I fell on the concrete.  I've been in pain ever since. I'll take  either Oxycodone Apap, or Norco  Hydrocodone  anyday...  Like House would say ""life is pain, I wake up every morning with pain,  I go to work in Pain""! Lumbar Spondylosis in L5-S1 hurting for 12 years then they found bone spurs, with moderate Stenosis 34 epidurals has not helped, it is in both Cervical/Lumbar areas. I'm tired of pain 24/7 when I sleep no pain whatsoever! This medicine and Norco are 9's to me."	9	March 28, 2021	5
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Percocet (acetaminophen / oxycodone) for Chronic Pain	I've been on my meds since 1997. I was in a car accident crushed against a tree in my car. I didn't start my meds during the craziness. Over 20 years my pain meds keep me normal. I've been with the same pharmacy for about 4 years. I have never given them a problem. In the beginning of this month he claimed to of not had my usual brand. I desperately asked him how it will affect me and is this only once. He told me it's the same different manufacturers and that he hasn't gotten any of my normal ones. I trusted his word. Then once I tried them I called him and complained explaining this is not working. He also suggested I go somewhere else I explained to him that is not right I simply want what I know works for me. I am praying that when it's my next pick up he gives me what I'm supposed to have. This particular brand of percocet has been making me sick it's not a mind thing it's physical pain. U17 are the barings on the pill  the brand is Aurolife Pharma LLC and they do not serve there purpose. Please don't make the same mistakes as I did. We have rights	1	March 15, 2021	18
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Chronic Pain	I took NORCO 10/325 for years due to 9 knee surgeries and back pain from an auto accident. Tried to tell my doctor that the Camber white 20/325 were absolute garbage compared to Norco but he acted like I was a junkie. I printed out hundreds of reviews and laid them in his hands and my next visit he requested my pharmacy carry the Alvogen brand and its like night and day difference. Camber is awful to your body with all the fillers they use!! Stay strong my friends and I hope you all find pain relief!	1	March 14, 2021	6
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Percocet (acetaminophen / oxycodone) for Pain	I do not like this medication at all.  I was prescribed 10/325 after I had endometriosis excision surgery last year.  I had never taken oxycodone before and I don't want to take it again if I have another choice.  It made me feel incredibly loopy and brain foggy.  It took away the pain, but the side effects were awful.  I had some pills leftover because I wanted to stop taking them but I kept them in case I needed them later.  I had ankle surgery late last year and ran out of my week's worth of meds (I took them in a week but still had a lot of pain due to tendon repair and bone shaving).  I had the Percocet in my med cabinet and took half and it was horrible.  I relived the experience all over again.  I don't want this medication.	5	March 12, 2021	2
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Chronic Pain	I've been taking oxycodone 10/325 for a couple of years but only when I've gotten to a point that the pain has kept me from sleeping. My pharmacy checked my usage and said I was not opioid dependent for the amount of times I get a refill and length of time between refills. I am aware that opioids can become addicting and not great for long term use so I try to only take one when I'm in severe pain and other methods keep me from sleep. Have tried several generic's and while there may be slight differences the Dr. Reddy Wes pharma make me feel dizzy and very weak in my legs coupled with no relief of pain. The feeling is so weird after trying them several times I'm afraid to use them and since the reduction in pain is not happening I am questioning their authenticity. My pharmacy gave me two brands because they ran out of the other, marked difference in how they work for pain.	1	March 8, 2021	1
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Chronic Pain	People, ask your dr to switch you to oxy w/o Tylenol. You can take your Tylenol separately. Get 5’s , 10’s or whatever they’ll prescribe. I think it’ll work better.  Oxy/ Tylenol costs way more than just oxys. Try the kvk-tech, ind. pink, k 56 They work!! I have 1 disk that’s practically dust now and RA pain. One bulging in neck. They work	8	March 8, 2021	0
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Chronic Pain	I had been consistently on the Rhodes Brand of acetaminophen with oxycodone consistently for several years. I take it for chronic pain as directed.  I have been on the 7.5mg for a long time (this is so not good for you). Anyway, about two weeks ago my refill was due from the same local pharmacy I always use. It was a weekend (idk if this made the difference), but when I picked up, I noticed the Brand was different. The pills are made by Mallinckrodt. OMG they are not helping at all. The pain in my neck and back has returned times 100 & I'm constantly cold sweating. I feel horrible. The weather has been cold too which makes my arthritis pain and swelling even worse.  I have had to cut my days in half because of the pain I'm in. The nights are agony.  Maybe if you are on the same brand for a long time, any different manufacturer makes a difference.	8	March 7, 2021	0
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Chronic Pain	I am forced now to take Rhodes oxy 10/325 because there is nothing else available in my area. They are not scored, they will not split without crumbling, they do not work nearly as well and I'm getting withdrawal symptoms I've never had before. I take a half pill ever 4 hours because they don't last and I'm so frustrated. They are garbage.	4	February 24, 2021	5
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Chronic Pain	On 10mg codeine for years. Using only as needed, avoiding need for increased dose. The pill from Amneal is worthless. Doesn't touch the pain, barely stops withdrawal symptoms. Feb 2021 BCBS recalled coverage due to failure to meet FDA guidelines. Nothing else has been done. CVS claims its the only version they carry, their website says otherwise. Have a call into my Dr. Waiting. Don't know what to do. This pill really screws with your stomach. I'm hurting so much I can barely dress myself. Beyond upset. Needing help. Contacting an attorney.	1	February 19, 2021	3
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Chronic Pain	I was just switched from norco 750 to what's supposed to be Percocet 5. I've been on the Norco for over 10 years. My first three days on these Percocet. I'm sick. Absolutely NO pain relief. I have herniated and bulging disk. Both kidneys full of kidney stones. This is total junk.	1	February 9, 2021	3
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Pain	Well I don’t understand how chamber, Rhodes, and aneal and other company can give these acetaminophen with oxycodone out they do not work! I live in Louisiana and they used to carry Avalon and they work, now no one can get them at all ! Got to find something that works before I end up at the methadone clinic! I sure that what the government want us to take and to take weed ! What has happened to our health care ?	1	February 4, 2021	19
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Chronic Pain	Oxycodone has helped my pain a lot until RHODES 10-325 acetaminophen/oxycodone. Does not help pain they are garbage!!!  Taking oxycodone for 4 years due to cancer lesions on vertebrae from Multiple Myeloma.  The vertebrae fractured in a way it is pressing on sciatic nerve. So far no other broken bones. Pain in back,  legs shins, numb feet and legs. IT WOULD BE NICE IF ALL MANUFACTURERS COULD MAKE A PRODUCT WE CAN DEPEND ON THAT IS CONSISTENT TO HELP THE PAIN. DON'T MAKE GARBAGE AND STOP CUTTING CORNERS TO SAVE AT OUR EXPENSE.	10	January 29, 2021	43
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Chronic Pain	This medication does not work at all, I’m having bad side affects, CVS have told to me that they never know what the manufacturer will supply. I was with taking Rhodes, and it did the trick! Seems like there is no pain medication in these pills from WES Pharmacies, but there is severe side effects that I can’t handle, pharmacy won’t help, so I have to suffer until my next pain management appointment. Bad company!!!!!	1	January 28, 2021	5
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Chronic Pain	Do NOT let your pharmacist fool you into using the Camber brand of percocet.  It doesn't work.  It causes headaches, palpitations and an overall feeling of sluggishness.  You will not receive any pain relief and your energy level will drop to 0 after taking it.  I've taken other brands for chronic pain for years and they have all given pain relief and a sense of more energy.  Camber is the exact opposite. Ask your pharmacist what brand they have before they fill your prescription with Camber generic percocet. This is the first review I've ever written anywhere.  Take heed.	1	January 23, 2021	15
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Chronic Pain	I have had a cervical fusion C-4 C-5. Which left me with chronic pain due to nerve damage. I also have a herniated disc in my lumbar spine with bone spurs from spondylosis arthritis. I have been tapered down to oxycodone 5-325. I have tried many various generic brands. This is the first time I have had Camber Pharmacy acetaminophen with oxycodone and it is horrible. I'm glad I found this post because I thought I was crazy. Not only does it feel like a placebo I feel worse pain then not taking anything at all. I have never been in withdrawal but I imagine it hurts like this. Aching and pain in my neck and shoulders reminds me of the pain I felt before my surgery it was really bad. I asked my pharmacist to please note my profile to not give me this brand again. They should not be allowed to sell this brand.	1	January 5, 2021	14
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Chronic Pain	This is what I found out after getting percocet that I swear doesn't work like other percocet I've had. Not every brand of percocet is the same. The key ingredients are the same, but they don’t all use the same fillers, which can affect how the medication is ultimately absorbed by the body. This negatively impacts my therapy.	5	December 31, 2020	18
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Chronic Pain	Camber the worst generic brand of acetaminophen/oxycodone Mallincroft  ok but wear off quickly Alvogen best right now They have all gotten less effective in the last 3 years I have serious c2/c3 issues and can’t have surgery  The old yellow colored Vicodins worked best.	5	November 20, 2020	18
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Percocet 5/325 (acetaminophen / oxycodone) for Chronic Pain	After multiple spine surgeries I have weaned down to this dosage (Percocet 5/325) over the past years.  I have currently been on this dosage for about 3 years after starting on much higher and more frequent usage. Now I use it mostly to take edge off and take it at least once a day as needed. It works very good for me and I have not had any dependency or side effects from it.	10	November 16, 2020	5
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Percocet (acetaminophen / oxycodone) for Chronic Pain	Horrible medication reduces the pain from a 10 to a seven only lasts about two hours then strong craving settle in for more this is a horrible medication highly addictive with a little therapeutic use.	1	November 10, 2020	16
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Pain	This drug feels like a placebo.  There is zero effective.  I just had shoulder surgery, and am in pain, and have a bottle of nothing.  Rite Aid filled it and basically said Oh Well.  I've had a number of surgeries and have been prescribed this before so I am familiar with its effect on me.  Even doubling the dose this time has had no effect at all.  Nothing.  I have calls out to the FDA and Rhodes. This cannot be allowed to continue.	1	October 30, 2020	40
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Percocet (acetaminophen / oxycodone) for Chronic Pain	Every disc in my entire spine is damaged, all sorts of conditions with Chronic Pain. I've been on Brand Percocet for 10+ years with a few years on the generics. The generics suck and don't do much for pain as I had to keep switching between them (so long on 1 and then so long on the other) but the Brand Percocet does work, for me anyway. I was even reduced from 5/day to 3/day and it's still working. NO addiction and NO dependence, my strength is 10/325. The ins co wants to put me on generics again not because they care about me it's the cost. Quality of life, along with other meds, is better but far from great. Any side affects are out weighed by how good they work without getting high.	10	October 26, 2020	22
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Chronic Pain	Horrible product. This is the 3rd non-consecutive time my pharmacy has used their company for my medication, and 3rd time the product didn't work. The medication is supposed to be oxycodone-acetaminophen 5-325, but works worse than 2.5-325. Waste of money, time, and prescription.	1	October 18, 2020	17
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Chronic Pain	I initially started with Watson brand then my pharmacy changed to Mallinkrodt generic after both of those companies went by the wayside they started carrying only Rhodes.  The Watson brand work very well. The Mallinkrodt brand well not as good as the Watson was still quite good at reducing pain.  The rhodes brand I have been on for the last year and a 1/2 has left me feeling really draggy and almost like moving in quicksand a lot of the time and its effect on pain is substantially less then any of the other generics of this medication I have taken if you can get another generic brand or the actual brand you would be way better off.	2	October 5, 2020	26

Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Chronic Pain	Rhodes acetaminophen/oxycodone generic for Percocet 10/325 are 32.7 % less effective than other's. Also they are known to cause depression and allergies.	1	September 15, 2020	26
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Percocet (acetaminophen / oxycodone) for Chronic Pain	I have three bulging disc and a big guy at 240 lb the Rhodes frond of oxycodone with acetaminophen 10-325 medications absolutely useless. They're like taking a placebo or just a regular Tylenol. My doctor said that some people's chemistry binds with the bodies chemicals incorrectly with the medication and makes it to the inert. Does zero. The other percocet brand that starts with an M, weird name worked to reduce pain by 50%	1	September 4, 2020	42
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Chronic Pain	I have severe endometriosis which causes extreme pain especially during my periods. I have taken three of these pills today and still have had hardly any relief! These are crap! Hardly any oxycodone in them at all. I'd say it's all Tylenol.	3	August 22, 2020	25
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Chronic Pain	"I've been prescribed a new generic brand of Oxycodone 10-325the The brand is Was by Dr Reddy Pharmaceutical and it doesn't work. It's not a brand I'm familiar with. It says ""Wes 203"" on one side and ""10-325"" on the back. I've have not felt any relief yet and I'm thinking it's a poor quality generic. Is anyone familiar with this brand?"	5	August 21, 2020	54
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Percocet 10/325 (acetaminophen / oxycodone) for Chronic Pain	This is the 1st time I've been given this Camber brand of acetaminophen/oxycodone and it's like taking Tylenol. My pharmacy didn't have the Mallinckropt in stock so I'll be switching to another pharmacy. This T194 seems like a placebo, no help with my pain at all. Very dissatisfied and this company should be ashamed!!!!! I'd give a Zero if I could !! If this message helps one person, then it was worth taking the time to review Cambers pain medication.	1	August 12, 2020	161
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Endocet (acetaminophen / oxycodone) for Chronic Pain	After a few on the job injuries, 2 lumbar spine surgeries & 7, (yes I said 7), cervical spine surgeries over 15 years, I have tried every narcotic & non-narcotic pain reliever going.  I am in constant pain since 2 of the neck surgeries were failures !  My pain management Dr. is a Saint in letting me play guinea pig since I wanted less narcotics.   After almost 20 years of 24/7 documented pain & surgeries, Endocet does the best job ever !  (Percocet is aces but who can afford it !).    I’ve been on 10/325mg Endocet for almost 15 years now and haven’t needed anything stronger, nor have I needed to ask for any more than my normal 150 quantity.  If the pain gets unbearable I am to take 2 every 4 hours which works pretty well for me.  Not many side effects, every 2nd or 3rd Rx I may get ‘the itchies’ an hour after taking them, it sucks but does go away.    Thank you for Endocet 10/325	9	July 23, 2020	27
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Percocet 5/325 (acetaminophen / oxycodone) for Pain	Was prescribed percocet 7.5 right after surgery and that dosage worked just fine,  six weeks after surgery, PM Dr. lowers dosage to 5-325 because he didn't want me on that dosage for an extended amount of time.   Now there is very little relief.  At 6 weeks post-OP; this dose is not strong enough to alleviate my pain.  Maybe in another 3 to 4 weeks it will be, but not at the present.	3	July 20, 2020	19
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Percocet (acetaminophen / oxycodone) for Chronic Pain	If you find that this medication doesn’t help you, it could be your liver lacks the enzyme to break it down. This medication also made me feel depressed- and I actually am a very happy person- so I knew I wasn’t depressed, but couldn’t shake the feeling of flatness. Also, this medication did almost nothing for my pain from severe facet arthritis, DDD and stenosis. I found 40 minutes later it felt like I had to take it again -  Thankfully my Dr switched me to something that does work, but I had a genetic test done for medication and found out I lack an enzyme to break the med down to the active form.  I also found out that the reason for my mood problems is because this drug interacts with the Kappa receptor, which can cause dysphoria.  Not great for me, but I know many people find relief with it. If you don’t or have the above experience- ask for a genetic test for pain medication- it is very helpful.	2	June 18, 2020	35
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Chronic Pain	I have been on oxycodone for 15yrs from multiple injury's. I take my medicine as prescribed. Not all generic brands are the same. The pharmacist will tell you they are but they are NOT. The generic brands of acetaminophen/oxycodone AMNEAL , ALVOGEN, CAMBER, RHODES ARE TERRIBLE. ACTIVAS AND MALLIKRODT ARE THE BEST. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT MG OR WHAT CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE YOU ARE ON. YOU HAVE THE RIGHT TO CHANGE PHARMACYS AND/OR ASK FOR THE PHARMACY TO ORDER THEM BRAND WHICH SOME PHARMACYS WILL AND SOME WON'T. IF YOUR PHARMACY WILL NOT ORDER YOUR BRAND, THEN SWITCH AND TELL THEM YOU GET ALLERGIES OR A STOMACH ACHE. WHICH I REALLY DO FOR CRAPPY BRANDS. I HOPE THIS HELPS A LOT OF PEOPLE SUFFERING IN PAIN. GOD BLESS.	10	June 16, 2020	156
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Percocet 5/325 (acetaminophen / oxycodone) for Pain	My endodontist prescribed me this med before retreatment of root canal for pain relief. I liked it worked within 20 min, but it made me so drowsy it put me sleep and relieved the pain not more than 3 hours. The pain came back exactly after 3 hours but couldn't take it again right away because it would exceed daily max. I switched to ibuprofen 600mg next day and it worked as quickly as that med did, and the effect lasted about 5 hours and it didn't make me drowsy.	6	June 14, 2020	10
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Percocet 10/325 (acetaminophen / oxycodone) for Chronic Pain	I tried one time at a different pharmacy because I called beforehand to ask what brand they carried. They filled it grudgingly and made me feel like I belonged under a bridge with a heroin needle. But their brand, Rhodes, was still better than the Alvogen. I switched back to my old pharmacy who knew me for the crappier pills just to save my self the “shame.” And that is wrong and I shouldn’t have to do that or feel that way.  Asking questions about the brand or asking anything about a narcotic seems to immediately put a label and a target on you. In the rare instance when my pharmacy received a different brand (KVT Tech, Mallinckrodt, Aurolife Pharma) they were all white oblong pills and worked well for my pain management. But of course that didn’t last and the abrupt switch back to the round yellow Alvogen gave me withdrawals and pain again. I do not want to leave my doc and pharmacy because I have history there that has protected me from the medication shaming that is so rampant.	2	June 2, 2020	119
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Percocet 10/325 (acetaminophen / oxycodone) for Chronic Pain	There seems to be some sort of issue with either the amount of opioid medication in the pill causing these to be ineffective. In 2016 when the DEA cracked down on pain patients on doctors, the quality of medication plummeted. Most of these are coming from overseas but have received some from RI  pharma (perdue pharma generics umbrella company) AND ARE  complete garbage.  Is there any oversight over these generics? Where is the confirmation that we are getting what we are paying for and most importantly who is monitoring A safe materials supply from other countries? If so many people have noticed an inconsistency with their medications, I find it extremely difficult to believe that we all are wrong.   Reports that these medications have been vetted and safe for us Americans to continue to ingest?    This should not be this difficult to verify that a medication indeed contains the correct ingredients and accurate levels of that active ingredients to verify that what's declared is actually in it.	3	May 29, 2020	113
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Chronic Pain	I’ve been a long time user of Percocet for neck, thoracic and limb  as t pain. In addition I’ve had 4 surgeries on left knee and reconstruction of right. Initially I was prescribed Mallink 5/325 Percocet for pain, which worked well.  My provider recently changed manufacturers of Percocet, which doesn’t appear to be as effective. My question is what gives. Is it less opiate or the process of manufacturing	4	May 22, 2020	32
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Percocet (acetaminophen / oxycodone) for Chronic Pain	I’m a Disabled Veteran who has had 13 knee surgeries of these are included the removal of the patella in each knee and since 2015 my right knee has been replaced 2x I’m currently prescribed Percocet 5/325 at 2 per day. I find this medication is more than capable of controlling my pain.	10	May 16, 2020	19
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Percocet (acetaminophen / oxycodone) for Chronic Pain	Something needs to be done.     10 mg oxycodone 120 pills.    Some are weaker and don't work on the pain.    All out of the same bottle.     Drug companies should be testing their products to make sure they are consistent!   While some are weaker ( in same bottle)  some are stronger.   For some this could be dangerous.	6	May 9, 2020	81
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Percocet 10/325 (acetaminophen / oxycodone) for Chronic Pain	I am finding a mixture of two different tablets in the same bottle and I highly suspect that there's a number of false pills. I can tell the difference of the pills and the fact that some of them do nothing for pain and the consistency and taste is different.	5	April 15, 2020	86
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Percocet (acetaminophen / oxycodone) for Chronic Pain	I broke my back at 25 this drug, keep me going, it helps me with my anxiety  as well make me more social and I can go to the gym and workout without pain.  But my doctor only gives me 75 a month I go thru them in 20 days. But he won't give me more. Which sucks the new laws make it hard for people that actually need this drug, rappers glorify drugs and people that need them get screwed I get 5/325 . Miracle drug for some.	10	April 10, 2020	45
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Percocet 7.5/325 (acetaminophen / oxycodone) for Chronic Pain	I suffer from chronic back and joint pains for years now.  I have been getting relief from acetaminophen/oxycodone 7.5/325 pain meds for about a year now. All started off ok giving relief that enabled me to get out and do things. Now the generic brand Camber does little for me and leaves side effects. I never had this problem or felt bad before. The pharmacies keep switching manufacturers looking for the cheapest generic prices I guess. Why is it that some brands that I took worked much better than others if they are (supposedly all the same) ?  IMO FDA oversight lacks on imported generic drugs :(  Can’t afford over a thousand dollars for the original medications  :(	3	March 11, 2020	55
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Percocet (acetaminophen / oxycodone) for Pain	Taking 5/325  acetaminophen & oxycodone every 6 hrs for intense tooth pain after oral surgery.  Had never taken an opioid before, this was truly a lifesaver for me.  Took my pain from a 10 to a 3.  Also taking 3 Ibuprofen every 6 hrs (alternating). My doc says if pain is brutal I can go to 10mg every 6 hrs, thats 2 pills.  Im trying to avoid that but suffice to say this stuff works quite well for me.   Pop a stool softener once in awhile.	9	March 3, 2020	33
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Percocet 10/325 (acetaminophen / oxycodone) for Chronic Pain	My pharmacy only has the  brand that is round white rp’s. They don’t touch my pain. My tolerance is so high, but no other drug store will give me 150 a month. I just had radio frequency ablation. Best thing eve,  even after 2 spine fusions I have never had pain relief this good. Today is Thursday and I had It done last Friday. They say it takes weeks for total results. It kills the nerves and works for up to 1 Yr. I Recommend You Google It.	3	February 27, 2020	49

Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Chronic Pain	I have chronic pain in my back, knees, and sciatica.  I’ve been on 7.5/325 MG pain relievers for 2+ years. The makers of my pills/pharmacies has changed many times. That’s when I started doing research. I’ve been taking Camber brand T 193 and don’t like the relief or sick feeling I get from them. Taking this brand has caused me to stay home most if the time now unlike a year ago when I could go to the grocery or other places.    (I wish I had a list of the earlier brands that worked) I’ve found Most generics come from India and FDA inspections are lacking. Found this informative link that sheds some light on Generic Drugs. google search -  bloomberg culture-of-bending-rules-in-india-challenges-u-s-drug-agency   I wish the FDA would recognize that some people’s quality of life depend on medications that work instead of profits.  More inspections of foreign drugs are needed.	3	February 22, 2020	55
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Chronic Pain	I have been taking generic Percocet 325/10mg for almost two years. The last refill was a white capsule shaped tablet with the imprint T-194 (Camber Pharmaceuticals, Inc.). Evidently, they are nothing but sugar pills. I have not had any relief since my refill and I have been itching from head to toe. I decided to look them up and looks like I’m not the only one with a complaint.		February 14, 2020	64
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Endocet (acetaminophen / oxycodone) for Chronic Pain	I have been on 10/325 Endocet for over 8 years. I lived in WA for 3 of those years, now moved to ND. In WA I paid $25.00 for 224 every 29 days. My pharmacist here as of today charging me $395.00 every 29 day. He says the price is going up, and if he runs it through my insurance he will lose money.  I can not do this anymore. I've been disabled since 2009. My spine is cemented L2, 3, 4, 5 & S1 it's also got 2 rods and 8 screws. My upper spine is twisted from degeneration and fused in 2 places . I don't know what to do. I had tried different ones like Watson but they don't make them anymore. I have chronic pancreatitous and can not take any NSAIDS. Reading all these comments is scaring me as to WHAT  DOES ONE TAKE WHEN ENDOCET GETS TO DARN EXPENSIVE. (Oh only 1 pharmacy will order them for me) any suggestions???	10	February 10, 2020	51
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Percocet 5/325 (acetaminophen / oxycodone) for Chronic Pain	I have had 1 discectomy and laminectomy on my left S-1 & -2 discs. After surgery I was given the peach colored 7.5/325 and they did wonders. During  Physical therapy I herniated my L-4 &-5 on the right. I have surgery in a few days. My neurosurgeon prescribed me 30 of the white generic 5mg/325 percs until my surgery day. These small white round generic 5mg Percocet are complete trash. Yeah, it might slightly ease my back pain for an hour or so but I personally believe that’s because my mind is concentrating on keeping my food down. Honestly, I’m a recovering addict and I came off my suboxone for surgery per doctors orders. You would think Percocet might subdue the withdrawal symptoms but I’m not even sure if did. I actually felt worse after I took the Percocet. I’m calling my doctor today and going back to hydrocodone or morphine if he will. I will NOT take another generic Percocet again.	3	February 6, 2020	24
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Percocet (acetaminophen / oxycodone) for Chronic Pain	I have multiple painful conditions such as DDD (cervical and lumbar), sacroilitis, sciatica, small fiber neuropathy, and have been recently diagnosed by my pain doctor with Complex Regional Pain Syndrome. For years I have been prescribed one treatment or medication after another with poor results. I am now taking high doses of gabapentin for the nerve pain and 10/325 Percocet three times a day, and this is what keeps me functioning daily and working full time. If it wasn’t for Percocet I would most likely be bedridden and on disability.	10	February 1, 2020	50
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Chronic Pain	It's sad to hear how so many REAL PAIN sufferers are going thru so much because these losers are snorting, injecting and goodness only knows what else with the pills. I've had L-3 spinal fusion for a torn disc, lower back arthritis,  dislocated collarbone, carpal tunnel syndrome and sciatica. Dr did surgery on right hand and L-3. I've been on 10/325 percocet for 10 yrs and 10/325 lortabs for 3 yrs. Only ones ever worked was Endocet (yellow E712). Alvogen helps. However,  AMNEAL brand pf acetaminophen/oxycodone is nothing more then a tic-tac. I can take 2 at a time and NOTHING feels like pain gets worse. The FDA what are you doing? please investigate! The only thing they monitor is the money they take in, forget the legitimate pain suffering everyday. If they monitor the heroin, marijuana and cocaine half as much the country would be DRUG FREE. I wish us all better days ahead PAIN FREE. Stay strong people!	5	January 30, 2020	65
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Chronic Pain	Unlike most of the other posts I have been reading, I find that the Camber ( oblong light yellow) pills actually work much better for me than the Mallinckrodt brand (white).  For or some reason  the Mallinickrodt make me itch really bad, make me feel warm  and doesn't seem to provide as much relief. Amazing how everyone has different side effects.	8	January 26, 2020	28
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Chronic Pain	I've been in pain management for over 4 years and have gone through different manufacturers of acetaminophen with oxycodone  from what the pharmacy can provide. I recently have been dealing with leg problems and my muscles don't work and thought I was going to end up in a wheelchair after multiple MRIS neurologist appointments nerve scans with no positive results. Last week I switch to a different manufacturer of my oxycodone 15 mg the muscles in my legs came back and the stomach pain is gone!! The brand of acetaminophen/oxycodone that I take now is camber pharmaceuticals very small pill doesn't have much fillers I'm so mad that I had to go through all that treatment just to find out it was something they were adding to my medication that was causing me severe problems	5	January 26, 2020	25
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Chronic Pain	"Been taking Oxycodone/acetaminophen for a long time for spine pain/ bone spurs/ arthritis of the spine. Got a different pill this time from Amneal Pharm. / CVS. Absolute NO pain relief and will struggle to bear the pain rather than take more than the prescribed dose. I'm over 70 and I am in such  severe pain, why? These pills are clearly different than my last Rx. What can I do? Is taking them back to the pharm an option? The pill has IP204 on the surface. Anyone know anything about this ""pain pill"" that does nothing for pain relief? Address your response to Red, please."	1	January 18, 2020	51
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Pain	Camber brand of 10/325  acetaminophen with oxycodone are garbage ! They are placebos in my opinion.	1	January 17, 2020	45
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Pain	BIG MIKE---YES, I'm on this horrible M523 acetaminophen/oxycodone  after suffering stomach complications. Kings County Hospital was too paranoid  to allow me pain relievers so I had to ask my pain management doctor for my back who usually prescribes me oxycodone 5mg every month with  no issues or running out of prescription. Unfortunately I started using more of my back pain meds to deal with stomach pain (NOTE: oxycodone does not cause stomach issues as NSAIDS may cause issues long term.) I begged my pain management doctor for a new prescription so he gave me 10 mg of the M523....it made me drowsy and lethargic while I still dealt with pain. Finally through time my stomach healed on it's own THANK GOODNESS. So now I'm going take back the heap of fake pills back to Walgreens and just settle with my usual prescription which is due today.  DO NOT ACCEPT ANY PRESCRIPTION FROM Mallinckrodt INC! BEWARE.	1	January 17, 2020	37
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Chronic Pain	I'm disgusted after reading these comments...because I too had a chronic pain issue for years and have been taking a generic oxycodone 5mg but was fine with it. I then had  a stomach ulcer that was not at all from pain meds but from acids and other issues. My doctor prescribed me 10 mgs of M523. (Mallinckrodt Inc brand) ....THIS DOES NOT WORK. THIS IS A SHAM OR SOME KIND OF PLACEBO...WHICH IS A SHAM. DO NOT ALLOW YOUR DR OR PHARMACIST prescribe this to you. I was wondering why there was no pain relief but through time my pain was more manageable but NOT because of this useless so called pain reliever. I'm going to call my doctor and pharmacist. I actually had to pay for this medication.	1	January 17, 2020	24
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Chronic Pain	Been in pain management for 10 years. I’ve tried them all and can say they are all different!  Please respond to Bigmike in your first words since this review doesn’t allow responses.  Been loyal to WALGREENS this far.  The A333 brand was the BEST! I then was swapped to the T194,  which was good, then yellow then the M523 (Mallinckrodt) then switched to the T194 Camber brand.   M523 Has been the worst for me! I am lazy and “ spaced out” only on these! Never had I’ll side effects like others describe but feel dumb and unproductive, compared to energized and euphoric on all the others.   Anyone else?  I’ve had a 3 week sore throat on the Mallinckrodt M325 too.  Anyone have any alternatives as I can’t continue to live like this?	3	January 3, 2020	49
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Chronic Pain	I have been taking generic percocet for years off and on for chronic pain.   I did have Camber brand acetaminophen with oxycodone before and had constant sweating. I now have finished 60 over 4 months of Mallinckrodt and had constant stomach pain and nausea when taken.  The pain medication has a shorter effect to keep the pain away.  What is in this Mallinckrodt Brand of acetaminophen with oxycodone. I cannot take it anymore?  I have mentioned this to my doctor and the pharmacist to no avail.	3	December 29, 2019	33
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Percocet 10/325 (acetaminophen / oxycodone) for Chronic Pain	Was taking Alvogen (India) brand of acetaminophen with oxycodone again after REALLY bad experience with Camber/Ascent (Hetero is parent company in India) and last month's refill caused the same negative issues as the Camber. Must be one manufacturer in India making ingredients for generic drug makers. Filed another complaint with the FDA's Medwatch (EVERYONE that has an issue with a med MUST do this) and spoke with another FDA pharmacist. Life is hard enough when you're chronically ill but when you have to fight for medication and can't get decent medication it can make life unbearable. I will fight as long as I'm able. Search the net for what's going on with generics. It eye opening and very scary.	9	December 26, 2019	131
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Chronic Pain	I’ve been tested for 2 months and test are negative on Camber generic Percocet  (acetaminophen / oxycodone) from publixs and Now a new generic from a private run pharmacy Rhodes brand and I tested negative again, so I want to know are they putting any active ingredients in these???.  So with that said seeing a spinal neurologist and using pain meds when needed, I have never tested negative on the Alvogen generic and it seems to help 100% better than the Camber or Rhodes.  There is no way on this earth I should’ve tested negative.  Something needs to be done about the bad genetics.	1	December 6, 2019	53
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Chronic Pain	I broke my hand, so  I did a lot of PT (physical therapy)  Hand surgery is very highly specialized and PT is necessary with pain relief.  Here is the point.  My surgeon was a military doctor on the battle field of war.  When I asked him for some pain killers he simply asked me what worked for me.  So I told him Percocet and he treated me. If your doc can't treat then find one who will. I was doing fine with Percocet then the drug stores and doctor's got pressure. So you have to advocate for your self.  ENDOCET  works less than Percodan/cet so I take an asprin   I am trying out some RHOD and seem to get some short term relief.  Doctors are being crushed by the DEA and considered BAD MD's for treating people with pain.  Just ask the MD will you treat pain? And then you have to have a heart to heart with your pharmacist to order your brand. ENDOCET or Activis . The Camber brand is rubbish and gives you a blue tongue!  Smurf!!!	8	December 5, 2019	27
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Chronic Pain	I've been taking Oxycodone 5mg for 13 years.  For pain from car accident and other medical conditions. Anyways, I normally go to CVS to get my prescription filled the pills are normally marked with a 512 and they are white and round BUT now when I go to CVS the same one that I have been using for years always has the excuse, Sorry sir we don't have enough to honor the prescription or sorry sir we have to order them and it will be a few days.   I started going to a MA-PA Pharmacy across the street, they do give me rough time about filling a prescription 2 to 4 days early and they always have the medications I need.  But the pills I get from them have an ALV 196 when I take them they do not give me the relief I would get from the other Oxy pills that have 512 on them.  I thought they were all the same thing?  Am I wrong?  Appreciate any feedback.  Also feedback from anyone if they have similar issues with CVS giving you excuses about not having your pain meds.	9	December 4, 2019	33
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Percocet 10/325 (acetaminophen / oxycodone) for Chronic Pain	I've been in pain management since 2009. I have chronic pain  from  a ruptured C6, ruptured L3,4,5 & sciatic pain with stenosis. I was taking the Mallinckrodt  brand of acetaminophen and oxycodone & I've known my pharmacist at this particular for over a  decade. He came down to the pharmacy consult area & told me that I should transfer my Rx's to a mom & pop so I could get a good brand. Well I switched to a smaller pharmacy and they used the RP little round 10/325 percocets. Heck the bottom of the bottle even looked like it was sand particles + they were irritating my throat. I asked my doctor about it & she told me to switch to another Ma & Pa pharmacy who used Alvogen (yellow) generic percocets. They seem to work just fine & I haven't noticed any additional problems + my throat doesn't get sore. I never knew that these companies could/would make pills with so many different fillers & vary widely in strengths. As for me the best brand of acetaminophen with oxycodone  is the round yellow Alvogen 10/325 percocets work good for me...	7	December 3, 2019	98
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Percocet 10/325 (acetaminophen / oxycodone) for Chronic Pain	My pharmacy changed. To percosets to ALVAGEN,  brand.  I had no idea because they were sent it through email. I returned them, through the mail  I have a lumbar fusion and a neck fusion . I suffer unbearable pain. I had to  take three. To  Straighten my legs in the morning  to walk . I think they are placebo's. I can't believe they actually giv these to chronic pain sufferers. It's a Shane when people really suffer in pain to give these to people j owing they can't fill their prescription again I returned to my mail pharmacy.. I ll suffer. Before you g to through all the trouble. It's not worth it  I'll never take them again.  Sincerely Amanda Poore	1	November 28, 2019	45
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Percocet 10/325 (acetaminophen / oxycodone) for Chronic Pain	Been on these meds for 9 years due to a severe back injury.  Each MRI was worse than the previous.  W/O these meds I cannot function. The mfg(Rhodes)was changed to KVK Tech.  KVK gave me severe diarrhea.  My dr said that was impossible.  She said I most likely had diarrhea because I’m selling them instead of taking them. I'm on 112 of the 5mg every 14 days and I’m having withdrawals.  I found out the KVK brand has an extra inactive ingredient, some kind of lactose something,   I’m lactose intolerant.  My dr. cut the quantity in half believing I was selling them. 2 months on the KVK brand severe diarrhea non stop.  One morning the pain was so bad in my leg and back I couldn’t walk and was taken to the hospital and was admitted.  MRI revealed a benign growth on my spine and was now pinching nerves. My dr called it arthritis. Years of Rhodes (oxy) seemed to work.  Mallinckrodt also worked ok.  I just filled 10/325 of camber will see if those work.  KVK absolutely does not work for me.	8	November 21, 2019	38
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Chronic Pain	RPS brand acetaminophen/oxycodone come from cvs. Instead go to kroger or walgreens and you wont get that useless med .I have hurt now for 5 years with chronic pain in my back and legs .see a pain dr . Was on good meds that helped then one day .my pharmacy dident have my med and I was leaving on vacation for 2 weeks . I went to cvs and filled . Worst mistake of my life . I went to hawaii to visit my daughters .and was in so much pain I could not get up and enjoy seeing my daughters . It was the worst 2 weeks of my life the RPS brand were like taking an aspirin that didn't even help me with even a little pain relief.  All I did for the most part was sit in the hotel and in the car. My girls tried to help me so much . The pain literally kept me down . I tried to walk with them and would have to sit every 10 min . I don't get to see my girls much living so far away but I tried my best to enjoy the time I had .I will never go back .	1	November 4, 2019	20
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Chronic Pain	When I was 28 I was in Iraq (2010) as a gunner for our Sgt Major and Colonel. We was on a mission and 3 IED’s (improvised explosive device) went and flipped our truck. My strap broke when I was in the gunners hatch but long story short I broke my back and my right leg. I was given the MBlock 15mg pills and it worked but I switched doctors and they prescribed me the RP 10/325. I am a strong person and can take a lot of pain but when it gets unbearable I do expect for the medicine to work. So I understand what all you are going through when you take the RP 10/325 and it doesn’t work. I will pray for everyone that’s having any kind of pain and trust me things will get better. We can’t expect them to understand our pain when they don’t have to go through it.   Try the 15mg Mblock or the RP 20	1	October 24, 2019	34
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Pain	I developed shingles and tried other pain medications. None worked until this. I want to point out that in no way is this a daily way of life pill. It is  intended for use in pain. I only received one weeks worth, thats all I need.	9	October 22, 2019	13
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Percocet 10/325 (acetaminophen / oxycodone) for Pain	Camber brand is garbage do not except it tell them you want another brand tell your doctor it causes headaches high blood pressure does nothing to the pain they’re allowed to reduce 20% of the active medicine and generics this seems to be reduced 75%	1	October 20, 2019	70
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Chronic Pain	Are they looking into acetaminophen / Oxycodone 10 because they do NOT work. This is a scam and they are trying to fool us. If you're really in pain then you know this doesn’t work. They are fooling us and putting something else  (or nothing) in these meds. Can someone please investigate! 	1	October 17, 2019	49
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Nalocet (acetaminophen / oxycodone) for Chronic Pain	After many years, I was recently switched from Norco 10/325 to Nalocet, which currently is brand only and offered in a 2.5/300 formula. I was having some terrible side effects from various generic brands of Norco within the last year or so, and my physician talked to me about the Nalocet. My understanding is that brand names are held to a higher standard than the cheap, third world generics we’re seeing now, so I thought the Nalocet may be a better option. Well, I was wrong. Aside from the difficulty in even finding the medication (none of the chains could even order it; I had to go to a specialty pharmacy to obtain it), the medication seems rather weak. Like the other reviewer stated, it’s probably the low dosage. The higher copays, lack of pain relief, and inconvenience in getting the meds are enough to not stay on this treatment.	3	October 17, 2019	11
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Percocet (acetaminophen / oxycodone) for Pain	I have taken percs before and the last time I picked up my script the pharmacy told me these may be made outside the US. Noticing some of the comments and people getting sick is it possible that those symptoms cause the ill effect from being made outside the country? Just an opinion...		October 16, 2019	39
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Chronic Pain	I’ve never looked up a medication before but I have chronic arthritis of the spine and it’s only getting worse. I didn’t look at my medication I just assumed it was the same as usual. I always take a half dose in the morning and half a dose approximately every three to four hours through out the day. I only need 25-30mgs a day to get me through my day. Well today something was off. I started feeling so much pain, I had stomach cramps, my spine and shoulders could barely move. I couldn’t believe I was taking another half a dose within another hour and a half. Then I felt nauseated. I took the bottle and looked at the pills and saw they were not the same. I am a half a dose away from my full daily dose and feel NO EFFECTS from this medication. I just took an entire pill, something I haven’t done since my spine surgery 5 years ago. I can barely move and my legs are starting to ache. I thought they gave me placebos so I looked them up. I will no longer get my prescriptions at CVS.	1	October 2, 2019	39
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Chronic Pain	I have taken  acetaminophen/oxycodone 10 325 for many years because of my spine pain. Have used several brands from Par, Caraco Sun and for years the Watson Brand. Recently CVS changed to Aurobindo  pharmacy. I don't care what they say, these pills do not have the same amount of pain killer in them. Not to mention the dizziness and nausea that you get from them. There are pure junk and detrimental to your health. I told the pharmacist I was allergic to them and they put that in their system. Low and behold the next month I get my pills and look at them after I walk out of the store and it's the same brand. I went back in and they said well I'm sorry that's all we had. Even though they knew I was allergic to it they gave me those again. And of course they wouldn't take them back.	2	October 2, 2019	30
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Pain	acetaminophen with oxycodone known as “RP” 10/325 (Rhodes) should be investigated. The potency of this medication is lacking. This so-called Oxycodone/acetamino brand does not relieve pain.		September 30, 2019	47
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Percocet 5/325 (acetaminophen / oxycodone) for Chronic Pain	I have noticed that  manufacturers of percocet use different formulas in their pills. Some are just awful and merely provide a sedative effect with very little pain relief.  The ones made by Alvogen (blue/scored) just knock me out and do nothing for the pain. The ones that work the best are the ones that are white, scored on one side and have the #512 on the other side (Mallinckrodt Pharmaceuticals?).  Just 1/2 of those works better for pain than two of any other brands. Stay away from the blue scored ones!  They are awful and do NOT help with pain. This opioid issue is merely fear mongering and those people who really need the pain relief are NOT getting the meds that they need because of it	2	September 16, 2019	69
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Percocet 10/325 (acetaminophen / oxycodone) for Pain	I have cancer pain and I've gotten generics from other companies and when I got the RP 10 325 (Rhodes Pharmaceuticals L.P.?) ones they do not work at all!

Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Chronic Pain	I have chronic low back pain as well fibromyalgia! I have been taking generic Norco for over 10 years off and on, and never had such horrible side effects in my life as I had when given camber brand of acetaminophen/oxycodone,  I feel like I have the flu, I wake up with  diarrhea, migraines, dizziness, Sweats, stomach cramping , feels like my hearts racing while sitting. I’ve called the pharmacy with no help also called my doctor, and will Call my insurance as well. What is in the stuff?  Poison fillers. Praying this gets fixed ASAP and they pull this rubbish off the market.	1	August 27, 2019	47
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Pain	My issues are L-1 thru L-5 all bulged L-4 annular tear, arthritis in lower back. Took 10-500 hydrocodone with acetaminophen for 12 years, @ 3 a day then the laws changed and had to go every month for drugs at pain clinic where I told them meds only upset stomach didn’t help. So I was changed to oxycodone with acetaminophen 10-325 3xDay , along with epidural, facet injections, risotomy,  and SI injections.  I had no real relief and finally  had a second opinion from a spine specialist that gave me Meloxicam 7.5 and therapy - no more opioids never any real relief from the opioids .		August 25, 2019	24
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Chronic Pain	The acetaminophen with oxycodone doesn’t seem to work like it use to. I am in pain all the time, it is like they took the pain killers out of pill. I read that other people are having the same problem. How am I suppose to go to work in pain. I feel wronged not only did they cut me from 6 a day to 4 a day I am sure the stopped putting the active ingredients  out of the pill		August 24, 2019	46

Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Pain	Publix pharmacy just changed from Alvogen Genetic acetaminophen / Oxycodone to Chambers  generic and I have had terrible reactions. Headaches, nausea, elevated heart rate, irregular heartbeat, racing thoughts, unable to sleep, chills, hot flashes and sweats. I had to STOP taking after one week. The pharmacy told me they have had numerous complaints. They are trying to get another manufacturer again. In the interim my Health Insurance provider is trying to locate a pharmacy who carries the Alvogen Genetic.	1	August 14, 2019	49
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Chronic Pain	"I have been on Oxycodone with Percocet 10/325 mg for over 8 years now. I suffer from  Thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS), a herniated C5 in my neck and arthritis in my shoulders, neck and knees!! For over a year now, I’ve stayed in chronic pain ever since the pharmaceutical companies have changed the ingredients. I just picked up my prescription last week from CVS and my quality of life is at a 0%, I stopped going to Walgreens because the Oxycodone with Percocet Mallinkrodt brand made me sick, tired and had terrible mood swings!! I can’t get any pain relief to go to work, take care of my home/family by cooking and cleaning or do any normal activities!! These pills are killing us more now, than they have ever before with the ""opioid crisis“ of overdose! If you think people overdosed before, people with chronic pain is really going to overdose NOW by taking more than prescribed!!! I hope once this is a reality to the CDC, FDA, DEA and the GOVERNMENT there will be an awarded lawsuit for every patient this has affected!!"	1	August 13, 2019	75
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Xartemis XR (acetaminophen / oxycodone) for Chronic Pain	I took Xartemis XR for 3+ years. I very much appreciate how it did not interfere with my work. I am a teacher and not willing to take anything with negative effects on me, how I teach or on my students. While taking it 2x per day, I simply began to notice I was not thinking about the pain all the time as I had been. Not noticing it sometimes - amazing! I think the extended release aspect of it eliminates feeling extreme highs and lows somehow. The only issue now is I changed doctors and no one wants to prescribe it because of the active ingredient. It is immediately dismissed and, oddly, they prescribe medications that are known to impair performance. I was uncomfortable with my original doctor so I will not go back. After three back surgeries, so far, I only have aspirin or advil which do not work as well but I keep hoping doctors become better educated about this version of this medication and understand how it works.

Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Chronic Pain	I was switched from endocet pill imprint E 712  (Endo Pharmaceuticals Inc.) to a generic.  The generic  have made me sick with diarrhea, Horrible RLS AND RAS, I am literally  going through withdrawal taking this medication, stomach cramping, goose bumps, someone take these off the market they are horrible.  Do these even have any acetaminophen or oxycodone in them ?	1	August 10, 2019	28
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Chronic Pain	I'm so glad I read most of the reviews! My pharmacy, switched from Alvogen 10/325, to Camber  brand  acetaminophen/oxycodone and I've been sick fro three weeks! I have severe Osteoarthritis in my spine, neck and knees, and have been taking Alvogen brand for 3 years. I'm about to refill, so I'm calling pharmacies to ask what brand they carry.......I sound like a junkie, but some days I can't get out of bed. There is a definite issue with the Camber brand and should be checked by the FDA.	1	July 23, 2019	63
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Pain	This med is so bad you will actually experience withdrawal symptoms. Best bet is to ask pharmacist for brand before having script filled. You will be surprised.	1	July 22, 2019	37
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Chronic Pain	"This is a reveiw on the generics of acetaminophen with oxycodone. AMNEAL PHARMACEUTICALS are the worse you can get. My pharmacist said ENDOCET was still on back order which are the only ones that ever worked for me.  Spinal fusion/titanium rods and screws surgery, bullet right leg (innocent bystander), sciatic nerve damage and hip arthritis. I would need 3 AMNEAL 10/325 as opposed to 1 ENDOCET. I have no choice now but to wait until my next refill in August. Its horrible that so many have abused this medication and people like all of us GENUINE pain sufferers must use ""fake  or placebo type medicine"". I hope the FDA will realize there are many people with legitimate daily pain. Going forward I pray everyone on this site find relief and good health. All the very best to you all."	1	July 21, 2019	64
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Chronic Pain	I've been taking acetaminophen with oxycodone 10/325 for the last 10 years for my chronic condition, and these Camber made pills seem to have half of the oxycodone in it since I have to take more to achieve the relieve I've received from other generic brands. Also, having taken more it's made me more restless than relieved, and it's completely thrown my managed consumption amount so I hope I have enough for the entire month. Now I'm stuck with these until my next fill!!	1	July 18, 2019	38
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Chronic Pain	I’ve read some of the reviews about Walgreens, I suffer from chronic pain and about a year ago I noticed that Walgreens 10/325 stopped working as well. I take them sparingly so I knew I wasn’t me. I switched to Walmart and they are working the way they are supposed to.	7	July 14, 2019	26
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Chronic Pain	Started going to Walgreens for medicine because it's preferred by my insurance. I was getting acetaminophen with oxycodone through CVS but a different brand other than Mallinckrodt and they were working halfway decent. These from Mallinckrodt with 10/325 and M523 on the other side are like taking a placebo. It takes more than what I was taking and I was starting to lower my dose down for breakthrough pain. I'm not getting as much pain relief as I was before on the other brand that was white and round carried by CVS. I've had a bilateral mastectomy for breast cancer with complications that left me in chronic pain. Then I got thyroid cancer that required thyroid removal that increased my pain. I've had problems breathing with feeling like my throat is closing. I thought it was just me until I came here. Report it to the FDA!	8	July 14, 2019	40
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Chronic Pain	Camber T 194 white oblong pills, supposedly generic Percocet, 10mg Oxycodone and 325mg Acetaminophen but I'll bet ten grand it's not. It will make you wish you'd gone to the street to get your prescription filled. For $599.00 I can have it tested and am compelled to do this as I've had numerous generic brands of Percocet in the past ten years and NEVER did they make me sick, completely useless and give me explosive diarrhea. I only took a half of a pill to see if I'd have an adverse effect as it happened once before (NOTHING like this though) and if I'd have taken a whole one I'd be at the ER right now. Also, the T194's on the Camber website are a light green in color in their photo but mine are white. ??? Is Camber trying to kill legitimate pain patients???	1	July 13, 2019	51
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Percocet 10/325 (acetaminophen / oxycodone) for Chronic Pain	"I've been taking the generic Percocet 10-325 made by Alvogen for years. I find it to be a very effective generic brand and have had little to no side effects; ( other than making me very energetic and manic) Today, my {same} pharmacy switched to a ( generic brand ) un-beknown to me. It's imprinted with a T194 on the pill and it's white and oblong (Camber Pharmaceuticals).  This is interesting as I have never consumed this particular ( generic) brand. I have read all the comments and I'm doing my own, non-biased review of this brand.  So far its working; but it's only been an hour since I took them.  Its disheartening to read all the bad and negative comments on this particular brand but I will be honest with my review. It does give me the euphoria that my Alvogen brand gave me which indicates to me that ""it's working"" or at least gives one the impression.                     I will add to this review as time goes on because people react differently to different brands."	6	July 12, 2019	60
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Percocet 10/325 (acetaminophen / oxycodone) for Chronic Pain	My pharmacy changed to this manufacturer. Wow. What a difference in strength.

Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Percocet 5/325 (acetaminophen / oxycodone) for Pain	June 2019 - My body hated it!  My doctor prescribed Oxycodone-acetaminophen 5-325 (Percocet) for pain from bulging disc in my hips and thighs and back. The Tramadol I've been taking for osteo-arthritis and foot pain wasn't helping the hips, thighs and back pain. I took only 3 half-tablets in a 10 hour period and after the 3rd half-tab I started feeling horrible. Dizzy, restless to the point of not sleeping, feeling awful.  When I did try to sleep I could not relax at all, and the really sad part is - the pain in my back, hips and thighs never went away so I was suffering from the drug and the pain. Not everyone is going to have bad side-effects but these were mine.	2	June 14, 2019	27

Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Chronic Pain	I have always taken my  acetaminophen with oxycodone prescriptions to Walgreens and never had a problem. Until 3 months ago I started having problems it was like their acetaminophen with oxycodone generic brand were fake - they just don't work. They wouldn't take them back. They said it was their new supplier. I now go to Winn-Dixie.	1	May 16, 2019	33
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Pain	I’ve been taking Oxycodone w /APAP 10/325  for 6 mos for chronic pain. I have had all prescriptions filled at Walgreens and had no complaints until now. My most recent prescription seems to possibly be fake. Previous pills were hard and shiny, and worked well, this batch is dull, soft and chalky and I can’t feel them working. All numbers stamped on pills as well as shape and size are the same but these are garbage. I’m taking them back to Walgreens tomorrow and having them refilled elsewhere. Possibly bootleg ???

Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Endocet (acetaminophen / oxycodone) for Chronic Pain	I have a field spinal fusion for 10 years I have a been on pain medicine from hydrocodone the Lortab to you name it and does it without a doubt is the most effective medicine I’ve ever been on for my back.

Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Primlev (acetaminophen / oxycodone) for Chronic Pain	According to my pain Dr, companies have a 20% allowable variance in the active ingredient.  That is horrible ! ! !   So they put me on a brand of oxycodone / acetaminophen, called PRIMLEV 10/300, and it has been AMAZING !  It actually works.

Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Percocet 10/325 (acetaminophen / oxycodone) for Chronic Pain	I was on the 5/325 for 5 years it wasn't reliving the pain, The Dr. Put me on 10/325. Again it works so far 4 more years. But I don't want to keep going up. At times when I wake up in no pain I don't take any. Rare but it happens. until the nerve pinches. It's a drug that I have not taken for days. And I don't seem to have the craving for it. I do this so I don't get addicted to them. But I'm not sure I have any side effects that others have. I would rather take one 2mg tablet of Dilaudid that I have no side effects at all.	8	April 28, 2019	21
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Percocet 10/325 (acetaminophen / oxycodone) for Chronic Pain	I was involved in an auto accident 30 years ago and suffer with chronic fibromyalgia, spinal cord injury, spinal stenosis, chronic sciatic pain in both legs, different forms of arthritis, neuropathy in both feet and legs -- not to mention the constant burning from head to toe. I had to undergo many years of therapy, back surgeries, injections in neck, shoulders, back, buttocks, knees, feet, and even nerve blocks. I, too, have been having problems with the Percocets M325 brand not working the same as other brands. They are also affecting my breathing; it feels like my airways are getting cut off. My drug store changes my medicine a lot without notifying me and they're suppose to. Is anyone else having this problem?  And, yes, the drug store #1 priority is PROFITS! Not us!	5	April 28, 2019	67
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Percocet 10/325 (acetaminophen / oxycodone) for Chronic Pain	"Must admit, that I only read a few comments. Only because I'm tired. But, I am astonished that I haven't read (or missed READING), what I consider to be the biggest problem. Not the only one, but from my experience the biggest. Doctors very routinely advise you to ""STAY AHEAD OF THE PAIN"". Now there is a presciption for addiction, if I ever heard of one. How, pray tell, do you know when the pain has run it's course and there is no longer any  PAIN TO STAY AHEAD OF?"		April 22, 2019	29
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Chronic Pain	Same experience as others filling Percocet at Walgreens . Sick like a dog and didn’t take care of my chronic pain. Had to switch to Alvogen brand and and I’m on the third month of severe diarrhea. I’ve been worried to death that I have cancer or something. I am convinced that this started when I was switched to an inferior brand. I suspect that the CDC has forced pharmacies to supply us with a drug that will cause us in time to not want to take it anymore. Please ! Fix this injustice to legitimate pain patients. This is truly torture and someone needs to investigate please. Both pharmacies in my small town is in on this effort to curb our use. On a good note , the CDC and doctors now can’t just drop a patient cold turkey or drop the dose too much at a time. It’s considered inhumane. Now , what about us, please give us back our correct medication strength.		April 16, 2019	37

Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Chronic Pain	About 2 years I started taking Percocet for a chronic lower back pain.  Well 2 years later that has progressed to degenerative disk, spinal stenosis, sciatica with neuropathy  in both feet.  Then while being treated for hip pain with injections (useless money maker for pain clinics), come to find that what was diagnosed as Bursa Sac issues was actually AVN (Osteoinecrois-Hip sockets were dying due to lack of blood-Rare 1 out of 20,000). Complete mis-diagnoses? Anyway for 1 1/2 years I thought I was on Rhodes Pharma (part of Purdue-Oxycontin), but this past January when my Pills were switched From a straight 10 marking to a 10/325 marking. It appears I was given a Straight Oxycodone by CVS instead of Generic Percocet.  What a difference! I called Rhodes and they promised to investigate but sent me a letter with (Blah, blah, blah). Because of CVS not being able to correctly fill my prescription I had them switced to a local MOM and POP.  Mistake # 3.	5	April 13, 2019	18
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Chronic Pain	I've been taking Oxycodone/acetaminophen 10/325 for about 2 years for severe pain. I got my monthly refill and immediately noticed it didn't work. I had taken my morning dose from the old bottle and it worked just fine. By the next day I started to experience withdrawal symptoms. I called the pharmacy and they are unwilling to replace these pills with pills from a different batch. Both the old prescription and new are from Rhodes Pharmaceuticals  acetaminophen/oxycodone but obviously they have distributed a bad batch.	1	April 12, 2019	26
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Chronic Pain	I’ve been on  Actavis brand of acetaminophen/oxycodone for years now  then Walgreens changed to  the Camber brand acetaminophen/oxycodone and can’t take it.

Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Chronic Pain	I have been getting my  acetaminophen/oxycodone 10/325 generic Percocet filled at Costco for 4 years now, they use the aurobindo brand which I have had zero problems with - it controls my pain 80 to 90 per cent. I have 2 spots of bad sciatica and a bulged disc. I once had to go to a local pharmacy and they had Rhodes brand of acetaminophen/oxycodone   and it made me sick and  I very little relief.  Costco makes money in the shop side of the store, so cutting costs at the pharmacy is not needed. 	8	April 11, 2019	27
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Chronic Pain	My Walgreens switched my acetaminophen/oxycodone 7.5  to Mallinckrodt 2 months ago and I do not seem to get the same pain relief. I am also experiencing headaches, nausea and I just feel lousy with this new brand. I am going to fill my next script at a different pharm  so I can get another brand and see if it helps. Maybe it's all in my head? I don't think so because I get more relief from my old scripts that are 5 mg ( I still had some left over). I am reading many people are having similar issues with Mallinckrodt. I wish I had a magic wand so I could wave it and help you all with your pain.	1	April 1, 2019	45
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Percocet 10/325 (acetaminophen / oxycodone) for Chronic Pain	I have severe pain from bad injuries in my neck , back, both knees.. I was given percocet 10 325 years ago. I must say it does help somewhat in combination with the others my doctor prescribed, but I honestly must say that some manufacturers do seem to me to work better than others. Why that is I am not certain, but I never had a problem with camber. I do have a problem with the mallinckrodt brand. It just doesn't seem to work for me very well and I don't know why. I know that everyone on this earth is different and so maybe that's why the same exact medications might work for some and might not work for others. I just noticed this problem since Walgreens switched the manufacturer to mallinckrodt. But I notice that if you discuss it with your pharmacy they act like your not right upstairs or something. I mean come on it is a legitimate issue to bring up.	10	March 28, 2019	89
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Percocet 7.5/325 (acetaminophen / oxycodone) for Chronic Pain	Actavis  acetaminophen/oxycodone 7.5/325 has been unavailable since Jan 2019 in my area. Recently I was advised it will be available mid April 2019 at local pharmacies.  Anyone else have any details regarding this particular generic availability. This generic has been very helpful and I have been using other generics which have not worked well.		March 23, 2019	16
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Percocet 10/325 (acetaminophen / oxycodone) for Chronic Pain	I've been on percocets for years. Normally the A333 brand  then was swapped to the T194, then yellow then the M523. They all worked good! Until my one day my pharmacy switched to the T194 Camber brand without my knowledge. Now keep in mind I'm not picky nor brave enough to tell my pharmacist what brand to give me, considering judgement of being label as an addict! So after my first pill within 8 hours my HEAD HURTED so bad it caused confusion, jittery, and cold sweats!! So I researched the inactive ingredients, it contains a silicone filler similar to sand. I do noticed a salty taste to them compared to the M523 brand that has a sweet taste to them. This pill doesn't work and the pharmacies and drug companies are putting profit ahead of our health.

Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Pain	Does anyone have any experience with Rhodes pharma for 7.5 oxy...  My pharmacy keeps changing and seems like blanks for others.  Rhodes I hear is better or is it better to get endo...the brand		March 19, 2019	18
Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Roxicet (acetaminophen / oxycodone) for Chronic Pain	I too have had chronic pain after terrible accident and have been on pain medication for decades. When I take CAMBER OXYCODONE HCL 15 MG they made me sick from withdrawal, nausea, diarrhea, chills, aches, no pain relief and stuck on them for.a month - is there any active ingredient in these. Tell your pharmacy to NEVER give you that brand again. If a chain, DRIVE TO ANOTHER to find different brand and PLEASE REPORT TO FDA. I have reported this terrible worthless drug to FDA. The more reports they get then maybe they will inspect further, and hopefully do tests on how much active ingredients are in them. I have refused this brand with my pharmacy. I am so sick from them and in terrible pain - I just can't function but have to use them for this month. DEMAND FDA do something. Please please report. There is a shortage of opioids thanks to junkies not us people in chronic pain who do what we are told. But if FDA don't stop this company we may be stuck with only being able to get these TRASH, USELESS PILLS!	1	March 18, 2019	40

Acetaminophen and Oxycodone	Chronic Pain	I’m on Percocet 10 for years. I was switched to the Mallinckrodt I knew they made me sick but I wasn’t told about the switch. I had to take them all month.  Years ago, my father in law built a pharmacy building. I got to know the pharmacist and her son on a casual basis. I got my Percocet there one month. I asked the Pharmacist son  why they carry a medicine that makes some people have stomach problems. This is what he said. “It’s strictly business. We’re allowed to purchase a pill with 100 % active ingredients but as low as 20% less.” It’s now 30% less. It is sad that Mallinckrodt was allowed to take 30 % of active ingredients out of their formula and makes us sick . Hang in there . Chronic patients . We worked all our lives and got hurt etc. and just want out of pain and a normal life. Thanks	4	March 2, 2019	43

Acetaminophen and butalbital		After long years of use an individual can become dependent since there is nothing out there in Medicine for severe migrains.  Of course dependency is not the same as addiction.  However one must caution the possible will not to take this for long periods of dependency but alternate with Ibuprofen 600mgs.  Thank you.	10	April 14, 2017	1

Acetaminophen and codeine	Tylenol with Codeine #3 (acetaminophen / codeine) for Pain	Went to the hospital for my toothache and Doctor gave me Ibuprofen 800 mg which is always a joke because it does nothing for pain. Thought it would get any better by going to my Dentist office & she gave me nothing at the office visit but ex-ray that showed wisdom tooth was the causing for pain that feels like someone is trying to take my gums and teeth out without a care at all. I have been crying like a baby. It feels like my head is going to explode. And she prescribed me Tylenol 3. Just took the third one and still waiting to see what relief I will get.	3	March 2, 2021	2

Acetaminophen and codeine	Tylenol with Codeine #3 (acetaminophen / codeine) for Pain	I take Tylenol 3 for tension migraines. For about 15 years, I took two pills and they eliminated the pain within 30 minutes. Worked every time for 15 years, and only recently has effectiveness decreased. A couple of months ago, I had to increase my dosage to 3 pills to achieve the same result. I have talked to a lot of people and they have said the same thing. I think they have changed the drugs in the pills now.	5	February 18, 2021	0

A couple of months ago, I had to increase my dosage to 2.5 pills to achieve the same result. Tylenol 3 only works for my migraines.

Acetaminophen and codeine	Tylenol with Codeine #3 (acetaminophen / codeine) for Pain	I just started on these Tylenol with Codeine #3, I have had chronic pain since 2005 and have been on norco for 8 yrs for a fusions in neck.  My sister was dying in hospice and I was packed to go be with her in last days and out of the blue they called for a pill count> mind you<they haven't called for pill count in 8 yrs. And I said one cuss word to the girl because she said you may get kicked out and they did because of me cussing - true story - so I had to find someone else and started me on tylonol with codeine useless for pain, the other doctor messed me up.	1	August 23, 2020	3
Acetaminophen and codeine	Tylenol with Codeine #3 (acetaminophen / codeine) for Osteoarthritis	I have had two hip replacements, one being 13 years ago, the other 7. Excruciating pain occurs in my SI every now and then, of course when one over does it. T3's are the most reliable relief, two extra strength tylenols don't even touch the discomfort and pain intensity. Whereas, with one T3, I can actually perform daily tasks.  I do not usually use it for more than two days in a row.. and usually many months apart. I have positive results and they work so well.	9	August 15, 2020	10
Acetaminophen and codeine	Tylenol with Codeine #4 (acetaminophen / codeine) for Pain	It should be noted I've been on pain medications for 21 years so you can imagine I've tried it all, I use Tylenol #4 for breakthrough pain and for me it works very well from an 8/10 to a 3-5/10 but bearable.  We each have different metabolisms that being said and as a result medicine doesn't do the same thing for everyone some of you will do well with Percocet or Vicodin, they don't work well for me but T4s do. Go figure.....so when you go to a doctor or go to the dentist they will take your opinion on this matter into consideration.  Only we know what works for us.  I saw so many reviews for T3s or T4s that said it didn't work for them it probably did to a minimal extent, but again you know your body and what pain medications especially that work for you I wish you all good luck in the future but for me T4s work wonders for me	8	June 25, 2020	9
Acetaminophen and codeine	Tylenol with Codeine #4 (acetaminophen / codeine) for Pain	Hi,  Although I do agree with everyone that these Tylenol-anything are junk for pain (especially if you’ve been on more effective pain relievers prior for a while), I just wanted to point out to all who are saying they’re flooding your liver with acetaminophen now that the DEA caused you to switch from other ones... Norco and T4s have all the same amount of Tylenol (aka acetaminophen or paracetamol depending where you’re from).  Just wanted to mention that, as well as that generic brands of all these have the exact same narcotics in them as the name brands so I’m not sure why people think they’re less effective. Maybe it’s the fillers? Who knows.  Anyways, yeah I agree that the DEA has screwed everyone in the USA. Something similar is happening here in Canada and it sucks for pain patients here so bad too! :(	2	April 30, 2020	4

Helped get me from a pain level or 6 or 7 down to a reasonable 1 or 2. Had been given Norco and even morphine previously but they where so strong I slept over 18hours a day.

Acetaminophen and codeine	Cough	This comment is for NightShadow. Do you take Lisipril by any chance, for blood pressure? I had that same disgusting constant cough for 2 years. I was in the salvation army doing my cough and one of the employees commented that she use to have the same cough. She linked it to the Lisipril. And sure enough!!!! That was the problem.

Acetaminophen and codeine	Pain	I thought it was just me; like maybe I somehow smoked too much marijuana and my body started to reject the pain relief from T3. Seems like this is not the case though because these pills do absolutely nothing. Not sure if they're some type of placebo or something but the infected cavity that I have currently sitting on my jaw nerve is supremely painful. When's the last time you seen a grown man cry? I've been taking these useless pills like candy hoping that they eventually kick in but these seemingly work slightly less better than Goody/BC powder.	2	December 5, 2019	6
Acetaminophen and codeine	Tylenol with Codeine #3 (acetaminophen / codeine) for Pain	I have come to the conclusion thru reading the comments below that the biggest addiction and overdose threat from this medication comes with the fact they don't treat moderate to severe pain.		November 5, 2019	22

Acetaminophen and codeine	Tylenol with Codeine #3 (acetaminophen / codeine) for Pain	I have been on pain medicine for about 2 decades, due to pain caused  by a motor bike crash. Broke my leg in three parts and crushed ankle etc. At first they put me on many pain medicine like morphine, oxy and many others but I got very addicted to them  due to my severe pain. So my doctors started cutting down slow and they started using Tylenol 3 and therapy. So now it has been over two decades and I am taking 6 Tylenol 3 a day with therapy. I am doing okay. I have to admit there is days that I have severe pain that Tylenol 3 relieves my pain a little. My advice for you out there that will have to take pain killers (that is what I call them) for a very long time,  before you would get out of control with them, go for therapy to know how to have self control over them.	9	July 26, 2019	21

Acetaminophen and codeine	Pain	"Dr. prescribed generic brand Tylenol #4 for arthritis, knee, back pain. I had been in pain at a level of 8-10. I was sent for Pain Management, no help. Dr. prescribed the acetaminophen with codeine 3 times a day and so last 5 years pain at a level of  3-4. For me it works. It has very low addiction rate. ""Codeine is a weak opioid, about 10% is metabolized to morphine. Still potential for abuse-addiction."" That depends on individual.  Long term use can cause issues, patient should be tested and followed by Dr. I moved from Birmingham to Mobile Ala. The Mobile Dr. was terrified,  said he would not risk losing his license. This is a Schedule III drug. Does not cause majority users to become addicted to it. This Dr. was unwilling to help or  discuss it, said take OTC pain remedy.  Checked with med. ins. co., pharmacy, it's approved, can be prescribed by Dr. with refills."	8	June 6, 2019	3
Acetaminophen and codeine	Tylenol with Codeine #3 (acetaminophen / codeine) for Pain	I was prescribed Tylenol with codiene T3 for a bad toothache that I’ve been having.

Acetaminophen and codeine	Pain	First, let me say that after reading many comments I'm surprised that people use Empracet for toothaches . They should use an anti-inflammatory like celebrex or naproxin, not codeine because the pain is due to inflammation . Anyway, I'm taking Empracet 30 (Acetaminophen and Codeine )  for Shingles in my face. If you think that a tooth ache is painful, shingles is WORST. Codeine help in 2 ways. It remove the stress from having shingles, i and help for the pain .  If you try to use it for something that have to do with bones ( breaking ,surgery, root canals ) it won't help much. I had a surgery in my hand and they had to cut the bones in my small finger and put some pins to hold the 2 bones together so that they fuse together. THIS was PAINFUL and Tylenol/codeine didn't do much , even if I took 2 or 3.  Some new medications for pain management will come soon. I hope so.  I live in Québec so the Rx if almost free , cost= $5 for 20 pills. Doctor= $0	9	December 29, 2018	5
Acetaminophen and codeine	Pain	Tylenol #3 or Tylenol with Codeine is one of the most effective painkiller for me however, just the  original Brand is effective and generics especially the one with letter M on it  just doesn't  work at all. If your doctor prescribe you this pain killer just make sure it is either the Brand name or if it is generic you must not get the one with letter M on it. I have been using the Brand name for more than 10 years and any time that my insurance tried to replace it with it's generic, if it was with letter M on it I had to prove to them that it is a fake medication. Any other type of generic although is not as good as the Brand sill Okay as long as it does not have Letter M on it.	1	December 19, 2018	7

Acetaminophen and codeine	Pain	This was the most awful experience with a drug I’ve ever taken.  I was up for 24 hours because I could not fall asleep, nauseated, and having brutal anxiety/paranoia. This was prescribed after I had a painful surgery. I was relatively healthy considering I lost a massive amount of weight. Others had great experiences, but unfortunately it doesn’t work with me. A waste.	1	September 22, 2018	7
Acetaminophen and codeine	Tylenol with Codeine #3 (acetaminophen / codeine) for Pain	Works great for my pain due to a torn Achilles tendon. Unfortunately with the current paranoia surrounding pain medications, good luck getting Tylenol 3. There are no doctors who will even write you a script for it anymore and will instead tell you to get OTC Advil or Tylenol.	9	September 13, 2018	15
Acetaminophen and codeine	Tylenol with Codeine #3 (acetaminophen / codeine) for Pain	First I must let you know I have a congenital disability that has become more severe as in pain and at my age of sixty-seven. I am some what more concern over my pain medication, which has today became a much more challenging issue in obtaining. Anyway, it is almost impossible for me to obtain good pain medication without jumping through many hoops, which I am sure some of you are now experiencing . Boy would I love to discuss that issue with you, anyway I have found that Tylenol with Codeine #3 is somewhat easy for me to get a prescription for, and it will work well with my Methadone I am now on for pain. So, sure I do believe Tylenol with Codeine is a good choice, it is very affordable, and for us with pain, it is for now. Somewhat less challenging to get our hands on, I just wish the medical model and those in control of our pain medication understand, they are actually harming us with severe pain. We don't sell our medication, because we need every pill...good luck friends.	8	June 14, 2018	25
Acetaminophen and codeine	Pain	Prescribed 150 every 25 days. 6x daily. I believe that's the highest recommended dose. Usually don't even work well to help pain but I don't want to go to pain management.	6	March 22, 2018	2
Acetaminophen and codeine	Tylenol with Codeine #4 (acetaminophen / codeine) for Osteoarthritis	Have been on these pain meds for 25 years, name brand McNeil. Take one with every meal and at bed time. When I moved from California to Georgia they started me on the generic ones. They do not help with the pain I suffer everyday, and it  does a number on upsetting my stomach an causing breakthrough migraines that I suffer from due to the lesion to my right temporal lobe. I pray to God that physicians will stop pushing generics as  good as name brand ones, when they are not.		March 1, 2018	16

Acetaminophen and codeine	Tylenol with Codeine #3 (acetaminophen / codeine) for Pain	I have really bad pain/fibromyalgia/osteoarthritis possibly. My pain doctor prescribed me this pill, and it has been a godsend. The only side effect I get, is nausea. I take a Zofran if it’s bad, it really helps my pain. It helps me function in life again.	9	January 27, 2018	16

Acetaminophen and codeine	Tylenol with Codeine #3 (acetaminophen / codeine) for Pain	I have chronic lower back pain with scoliosis and some lumbar area degenerative disease. Tylenol 3 is the only drug that my Drs will prescribe. The problem is it keeps me awake all night. I consequently use it sparingly and I live in pain. I had an epidural today and pray for some relief when meds kick in.		December 28, 2017	17
Acetaminophen and codeine	Tylenol with Codeine #3 (acetaminophen / codeine) for Pain	I have been having severe pain due to an infection in my cheek from my wisdoms. I went to the Emergency because it was on a weekend that I experienced this pain and was prescribed T3's and Amoxicillin for the infection. After taking 2 T3's and waiting an hour, the pain still seems to be throbbing. I don't know if it works for different people or what, but I am for sure disappointed and frustrated	4	December 4, 2017	18
Acetaminophen and codeine	Cough	I was prescribed Tylenol with Codeine #3 30/300 to take two tablets every 4-6 hours. It worked wonders for both my cough and the pain related to my severe bronchitis  I have read some double-blind studies that show that the fact that many people View codeine as inferior to, say, hydrocodone, is simply not true.	10	November 17, 2017	6
Acetaminophen and codeine	Tylenol with Codeine (acetaminophen / codeine) for Pain	I have been taking triptans on and off over the past 7 years even tho I favour homeopathic and naturopathic medicine over prescriptions drugs, but was desperate as suddenly getting migraines after menopause for the first time! After finally suffering rebound headaches as my Dr. did not warn me, I couldn't sleep or was being woken up with pain, so asked for tylenol 3 for the pain and after taking one a day solely for only 2 weeks, I was off the triptans, it felt like a miracle! However, once over the hurdle, don't take codeine for a long time as that can cause rebound headaches as well, but it got me thru!!	10	November 8, 2017	3
Acetaminophen and codeine	Tylenol with Codeine #3 (acetaminophen / codeine) for Pain	Have been given this several times for pain, and it never does anything for the pain. The only thing these cause is exhaustion, so I guess they would be good for sleeping.	1	October 27, 2017	8
Acetaminophen and codeine	Tylenol with Codeine #3 (acetaminophen / codeine) for Pain	Tylenol with Codeine #3 does nothing for me.. plain aspirin is more effective. I have been prescribed Codeine several times, many times even, over my lifetime, and each time. It seems as if I took nothing at all. I don't know why, but I just shake my head and even laugh, when they prescribe it.. After trying it yet again, thinking it was just a mistake, or they made it better.. again, it does absolutely nothing to relieve pain. I take several of them, and usually about halfway through the prescription, given me by the doctor, I switch to plain aspirin, to get some relief from pain.	1	October 18, 2017	11
Acetaminophen and codeine	Tylenol with Codeine #3 (acetaminophen / codeine) for Pain	Tylenol 3 did not work for me. I was suffering from unbearable pain from a tooth infection that kept me up all night. after 30mins the pain did not go away. After 1 hour still no relief. I wouldn't recommend this medicine to anyone.	1	October 12, 2017	18
Acetaminophen and codeine	Tylenol with Codeine #3 (acetaminophen / codeine) for Pain	Suffered a SAH (sub-arachnid brain hemorrhage 7 years ago and have been taking T-3's regularly in order to deal with post incident headaches, which can be quite sudden onset primarily due to exertion at work (lots of physical work in agriculture sector). Headaches are caused by blood trapped in my cerebral spinal fluid until it can break down small enough to pass back through the membrane - zanthochromas. After taking this dosage of up to 6 tablets a day I was quite concerned about my liver functionality,  however I just was tested pre-op for rotator surgery and was pleased to still have 97% functionality. Ask your dr.for a functionality test in order to make an informed decision before continuing it's use, it may not be adverse for you.	9	October 12, 2017	6
Acetaminophen and codeine	Tylenol with Codeine #3 (acetaminophen / codeine) for Pain	My two front teeth were progressively getting worse in pain from two nights ago when I had hit my teeth really hard. 7/10 pain scale last night/this morning - To the point where no toothache remedies were working anymore, including OTC pain medicine (which never worked from the start). Was prescribed Tylenol 3 this morning from the dentist as we wait to do a root canal on one tooth, the other tooth may just be bruised as it shows no sign for a root canal needed. It has been 2 hours and the medicine has extremely barely done anything. Waiting on doc to approve better medication.	2	August 7, 2017	11

Acetaminophen and codeine	Tylenol with Codeine #3 (acetaminophen / codeine) for Pain	I was prescribed Tylenol with codeine for when my gallstones act up. Well it does nothing for me. This last episode of pain woke me up out of my sleep, took my Tylenol with codeine and 30 minutes later, no relief. To top it off, because I had no relief from the pain I ended up puking.....ugh! I'm better off with the ibruprofen 600mg I have from the birth of my son.	1	May 10, 2017	9
Acetaminophen and codeine	Tylenol with Codeine #3 (acetaminophen / codeine) for Pain	After I was discharged from intensive care, I reported no pain, and no pain killers were given previously. After given Tylenol 3 in liquid form, and I started to experience pain with an extra large headache. The pain was in my eyes, temples, and ears not to mention throat. I got cold and my legs started to shake. Then I experienced more swelling in my throat than before, but I thought that this was post op normal. After the second dose I started to panic quietly inside and I couldn't get liquid Advil out of my mind! The nurse only had tablets, so my husband arrived and rushed me to the pharmacy to get some Chldrens liquid Advil, and 30 minutes later I was pain free! I'm not touching my prescription for Tylenol 3 and will tell the doc ASAP.	1	April 18, 2017	5

Acetaminophen and codeine	Tylenol with Codeine #3 (acetaminophen / codeine) for Pain	I have had all 4 of my wisdom teeth removed 2 days ago. To deal with the pain after my numbing injections wore off, I was prescribed Tylenol 3. When I got home, the pain from the operation was already starting to kick in, so I took one at 5 pm (which was when I got home) in hope of relieving my pain before trying to get to bed. I sat there in pain for the next 12 hrs, taking another pill every 4 hrs, and not a single bit of pain relief or drowsiness came to my aid.	1	March 12, 2017	26
Acetaminophen and codeine	Pain	Horrid drug, caused irg heart beat and problems breathing.	1	March 1, 2017	1
Acetaminophen and codeine	Tylenol with Codeine #3 (acetaminophen / codeine) for Pain	Post abdominal hysterectomy with anterior and posterior repairs and bladder lift. I was prescribed toradol 10mg scheduled every 6 hours with tylenol 3 every 4-6 as needed.   As long as I don't go any longer than those minimum times I do okay with about a 4 pain level.  I haven't been pain free yet but I guess that's to be expected.....tylenol 3 has worked ok but does start to wear off towards the end of the 4 hours. I must wait....it is a shame though that there is so much abuse of narcotic strength drugs like norco...they are extremely effective for post surgical pain....they are very addictive and Drs don't even like prescribing them much anymore	7	February 21, 2017	8
Acetaminophen and diphenhydramine	Tylenol PM (acetaminophen / diphenhydramine) for Insomnia	I have severe back pain everyday. Just had back fusion surgery in May. It's difficult to get comfortable at night in order to fall asleep. However, after taking two Tylenol PM (the recommended dose) within the hour I'm comfortable enough to doze off. I stay asleep for 6-10 hours most nights. Without it I would maybe get a few hours a night if I was lucky. Hope it works well for everyone else!	9	September 10, 2020	14
Acetaminophen and diphenhydramine	Tylenol PM (acetaminophen / diphenhydramine) for Insomnia	I am delirious after taking Tylenol PM. Super hot, mind racing in a tortured/exhausted state.

Acetaminophen and diphenhydramine	Tylenol PM (acetaminophen / diphenhydramine) for Headache	I hate this stuff. I took it at around 10:30pm and it did not help me sleep at all. I have been tossing and turning the whole night and having the most stressful, fast dreams. I woke up completely soaked in sweat even. I also am now awake at 5am (at least the third time I’ve woken up throughout the night) and my nose and throat are drier than the Sahara desert. I also have a heinous headache. I cannot wait until this stuff wears off so I don’t have to feel so dry and uncomfortable anymore.	1	June 27, 2020	7
Acetaminophen and diphenhydramine	Tylenol PM (acetaminophen / diphenhydramine) for Insomnia	It’s pretty effective at helping me sleep, I’m down for usually 10-12 hours. I usually get bad side effects from any medication I’m on, so here are the ones I’ve had. Feeling lightheaded, numbness in feet and legs, heart palpitations, blurred vision. Some of this may be my existing medical conditions but it’s worth mentioning. I don’t think I’d recommend taking this for a long amount of time?? I’m only using it to help me through the rest of school.	4	May 16, 2020	15

Acetaminophen and diphenhydramine	Legatrin PM (acetaminophen / diphenhydramine) for Pain	I have taken this medication for pain in my foot due to gout.  Nothing else I bought over the counter worked.  I read the bottle and decided to try it.  It eased my pain more than I ever thought an over the counter medicine could.  The only thing to be aware of is it makes you sleepy and drowsy.  But it works!	10	September 8, 2019	3

Acetaminophen and diphenhydramine	Tylenol PM (acetaminophen / diphenhydramine) for Insomnia	I have used Tylenol PM for a long time to help me fall asleep. Unlike Benadryl, this med actually keeps me asleep as well. However, the BEST effect from Tylenol PM is the dreams. I have had the most wonderful dreams.	10	June 6, 2019	45
Acetaminophen and diphenhydramine	Tylenol PM (acetaminophen / diphenhydramine) for Insomnia	Well I take this on & off, especially when we are low on melatonin or I can't simply sleep on melatonin. Some nights I can't sleep with taking it, and I take both.  Then it may take me a bit to actually fall asleep but I usually sleep 10/12 hours on it! My daughter told me she couldn't get me up the other day, I told her I remember her saying something to her & she was like yah but you wouldn't get out if bed. 	5	August 15, 2018	23

Acetaminophen and diphenhydramine	Percogesic Original Strength (acetaminophen / diphenhydramine) for Headache	In my earlier years I had severe migraines. I found that  percogesic was very effective in lessening the severity of these. I am 78 now and in 4th stage kidney failure so I am very limited in what OTC products I can safely take. I take a prescription pain med regularly for pain from a bad knee replacement plus 2 hip replacement and severe arthiritis. I  take percogesic for headaches since my pain meds do not help them while percogesic will usually stop them. I am very pleased that percogesic still does the job for me.		October 10, 2017	7

Acetaminophen and phenylephrine	Dilotab II (acetaminophen / phenylephrine) for Sinus Symptoms	I have taken prescription meds for over a month  and over the counter Meds .. and non of them ever worked. I stopped at a convenience  store and the cashier told me about Dilotab .So I bought a package just to try .. and oh WOW did It ever work on my sinuses. This is the only thing I take now.

Acetaminophen and phenylephrine	Sinus Symptoms	Works well for the nasal part of relief, but doesn't last. Also need to take Extra Strength Excedrin with this because this doesn't work strong enough on the headache aspect. Overall recommended.	9	June 6, 2018	2
Acetaminophen and pseudoephedrine	Ornex (acetaminophen / pseudoephedrine)	I first used Oranex caplets in the late 1980s, after the company nurse where I worked told me it would work better than plain Tylenol.  She was right and I continued to use it until my sinus headaches stopped occurring a couple of years later. A year ago last Spring the headaches returned and when I went looking for Oranex there was none to be found at any drugstore.  Why did they take this great and simple product off the market?	10	April 4, 2020	0
Acetaminophen and pseudoephedrine		This is my go to cold and flu relief med. I mix it in a double shot glass of cold water and shoot it down after it dissolves it treats headache, fever, sinus pain,  Generic store brands work just as well. It's inexpensive and I swear by it.	10	January 8, 2019	0
Acetaminophen and tramadol	Ultracet (acetaminophen / tramadol) for Pain	I used Ultracet 0.4 mg for my abdominal pain. But it's not very useful to me. I took one Ultracet before the pain worsened but still not provided a good relief to me. I went to the hospital after 4 hours as my pain increased gradually.	3	November 18, 2020	2
Acetaminophen and tramadol	Pain	I’ve had an extracted tooth before but this was the first time I’d been given Tramadol/Acetaminophen for pain afterward. I literally called the pharmacist crying my head off asking what else could I take for the pain!   I don’t remember what if been given in the past; (T-3) maybe, but THIS doesn’t work at all like whatever I’d had before! I counted on this medicine to get me through the healing peacefully. It has not.	2	May 16, 2020	6
Acetaminophen and tramadol	Pain	I have taken tramadol off an on for years. Everybody is different and everybody has different pain and different tolerances. Tramadol will help minor pain. For me it 50mg did nothing so had to take it 3 times a day I felt some relief not pain medicine for me though! But it is better than nothing everybody has their own pain levels & tramadol can treat those with minor pains & for some people who can’t handle the stronger pain pills.	4	September 29, 2019	7
Acetaminophen and tramadol	Ultracet (acetaminophen / tramadol) for Pain	Was given this after a tooth extraction. Yeah it works for mild pains (level 4 pain and lower ). It makes me extremely groggy, but I can't seem to really sleep very long while on it. It also dehydrates me really quickly.	5	June 21, 2019	10

Acetaminophen and tramadol	Pain	I have taken it for 2 issues over last 2 years. First was a lower disc, second was a pinched nerve in neck so upper disc. Without it I could not function.   First time was 6 pills a day for 2 months. Second was 3 pills a day for 4 weeks as the pinched nerve needed less. Nothing else allowed me to  move, work, sleep. Without it with the disc issue I could not stand.   I must say coming off was hard. I went slowly down to 1 and stopped but could not sleep for 4 to 6 weeks. Feels like you drank 10 coffees before bed. Pulse in the 90s, I am  norm of 65 pulse. It is worth it for allowing me to function but I wish there was some way to avoid the withdrawral as In fear I will need again someday.  Sleeping pills and other things did not help.	8	September 30, 2018	8
Acetaminophen and tramadol	Pain	I have been taking Tramadol for a period of ten years. A starting dosage of 300 mg daily. (100 mg 3 times daily) I have chronic pain in my shoulders, Doctors, Specialist and therapist have both told me, I have severe nerve damage in both shoulders that is not repairable, even though I am having corrective surgery to repair all the tendons, muscles, ligaments and rotator cuff that are torn and partially disconnected. I've never had an upset stomach, or an adverse reaction to the drug, fact is it immediately relieved the pain I was having and allowed me to resume a normal day's work. Addiction/Dependence? Yes I would say I was addicted to this medication. My reason as to Why? Cause it relieves the constant pain I experience 24 hrs a day. Yes I worry about all the side effects, but I AM a responsible adult and follow my doctor's direction.	10	September 11, 2018	14
Acetaminophen and tramadol	Ultracet (acetaminophen / tramadol) for Pain	"I've been taking Ultracet 37.5mg/325mg for 12 years.  I am 74 years old.  I have arthritis in my joints and degenerative disc disorder in my lower back.  I usually take one pill early am to take the edge off my pain for most of my daily activities.  If I have ""over done it"" throughout the day, I sometime have to take a second pill at bedtime to get pain relief and sleep."	9	July 12, 2018	50

Acetaminophen and tramadol	Ultracet (acetaminophen / tramadol) for Pain	I have several back and joint issues that have stemmed from degenerative joint and disc.  I take 3-4 pills daily to continue reasonable function.  I have 4 boys at home and pets.  Recently, our health insurance cut me down in coverage to 1 pill a day.  I'm in agony, level 4-5 pain now after 3 weeks of 1-1.5 pills.  Sad situation.  What do we do now? Medical procedure so expensive	8	March 22, 2018	16
Acetaminophen and tramadol	Ultracet (acetaminophen / tramadol) for Pain	I have arthritis and I am waiting for a hip replacement. The cartilage has gone in my hip. I am walking on bone on bone with terrible pain.  I take 4 - 8 tablets a day depending on the severity of the pain. Ultracet controls the pain perfectly and I can walk almost normally. I have been on the medication for about 4 months now with no side effects. It's brilliant and I would recommend Ultracet for pain relief. It is the only painkiller that works for me.	10	December 5, 2017	28
Acetaminophen and tramadol	Rheumatoid Arthritis	"I was originally prescribed this medication (it's called zaldiar where I live but is the same as Ultracet) when I got shingles and it helped a lot.  I've since continued to take it since I was also diagnosed with RA as it works incredibly well for me. It means the difference between controlling my pain sufficiently I can keep working, and being almost unable to function. It helps with both the pain and fatigue I feel -- when I first started to take it the effect was so profound I felt as though I was back to ""normal me"". I'm now taking 2 tablets twice a day and that's sufficient to keep everything under control most days. If I need to I can take them 3-4 times a day but that's rare for me unless I'm having a major RA flare."	9	November 12, 2017	12
Acetaminophen and tramadol	Pain	I've been using the red capsules for several years with good results.  Recently I was given the beige capsules by amneal and they make me sick and do not reduce my pain.  There were a few white ones mixed in with the others which also worked.  I now have a bottle of beige ones which are worthless unless you want to feel worse.  And, I am unable to get any others because they're controlled and the pharmacy says beige is all they can get from their supplier..	1	November 8, 2017	3
Acetaminophen and tramadol	Pain	This medication did not help me with my pain,  peroid. I took up to 400mg at once and still no relief but it did make me feel nauseated and gave me a headache. It's synthetic and really more like a weak antidepressant. I was prescribed it to alternate with my Hydrocodone 10mg tabs. I stopped my Norco for a 2 week period to give Tramadol a chance but it never worked. This stuff is rubish! No it's not equal to Codeine. I have taken Codeine and Tramadol is entirely different in effect. Sorry I'll stick to true Morphine based pain meds like Codeine, Hydrocodone, Oxycodone, etc. Even synthetic Darvocet worked better than this stuff!	1	May 26, 2017	9
Acetaminophen and tramadol	Pain	Was given this for the shingles. Works great. Tends to not work as well if taken too much. Dizzy and nauseated when I move but can tolerate.	9	May 24, 2017	5

Acetaminophen and tramadol	Ultracet (acetaminophen / tramadol) for Pain	Take this when taking a triptan for headache pain, this is to bring baseline pain level down a few notches if I was late taking my regular abortive it usually won't work unless I can get a control on the pain, Ultracet is mildly okay at this, just a trial for headache pain as I've tried many others, but not too bad to have sometimes, can be somewhat effective.	5	April 11, 2017	8
Acetaminophen (injection)	Sciatica	I have had a major back surgery and after tons of morphine, oxycodone, and OxyContin, the only things that takes my low back pain to zero is Buprenorphine. No type of  injections worked either. However, the only thing, including all the opioids that helps my sciatic pain is Tylenol. I can’t take any NSAIDS due to kidney failure from Metformin and NSAIDS but they never helped my sciatica.	10	April 8, 2021	0
Acetaminophen (injection)	Pain	Tylenol has never worked even a little for me. It seems to be the go-to pain reliever at hospitals and emergency rooms here in Canada, but really does nothing, even when it's Tylenol-3. It has never even got rid a headache for me, let alone real pain.  I can't count the number of times it's been prescribed for me following surgery for broken bones (for use after I'm off morphine or other opiates). It might as well be a sugar pill. My sister is the same — it just does nothing. I don't know why they still give this to people as a pain reliever. I always end up buying naproxen or ibuprofen instead.	1	April 2, 2021	1

Acetaminophen (injection)	Pain	It cannot be overstated how dangerous this medication is.  Over 100 teens DIE yearly in the USA ALONE from an Acetaminophen OD.  I believe personal experience is illustrative & common so I'll share.  The child was not truly trying to harm herself, as with most, they don't think it can harm them, their desire is to regain control.  They may vomit - regardless, they wake the next morning feeling embarrassed but fine, unaware their liver is dying inside them - & by the time they realize they are sick, nothing can be done.  Please EDUCATE YOUR CHILDREN ON THE DANGERS of this is liver-killing POISON!  NEVER EXCEED recommended dosage, I never go above 3 doses daily, & NEVER MIX WITH ALCOHOL!

My doctors were not aware of this reaction from Tylenol until I found this site.	4	February 4, 2017	6
Acetaminophen, Caffeine, and Isometheptene Mucate		"Prodrin has been a Godsend for me for several years. I suffer from daily migraines and cannot take imitrex everyday. Prodin (the generic version) works extremely well on the days that I cannot take imitrex. Now, because the FDA no longer approves Prodrin or its generic form, my insurance will no longer pay for the prescription. I usually get 120 tablets at a time and my co-pay was only $15. Now, thanks to the FDA regulations and my insurance refusing to pay, 120 tables will cost me over $500.  I can no longer can afford this life saving medication. Even if I get a smaller amount of pills, a scant 30 tablets costs $175.00. Thanks to the regulations imposed by the ""affordable care act"" I am suffering with daily migraines with no relief."	10	March 5, 2017	1
Acetaminophen, Isometheptene, and Dichloralphenazone		Midrin is the only medication I have ever found that works for my migraines. Prior to having it prescribed, I tried 9 more modern migraine medications that all failed. I would get migraines that lasted 2-3 days and I would be bedridden and throwing up the entire time. It used to be covered by my insurance with a $20 co-pay for 30 pills; but then it was taken off the market so I had to move to having it formulated. Formulation cost $75 for 30 pills which is pretty darn expensive, but worth it to be able to function normally. But now, I can't believe that I can't even have it formulated anymore. I'm down to 6 pills and I'm quite worried about what I'm going to do in the future.	10	April 16, 2021	1
Acetaminophen, Isometheptene, and Dichloralphenazone	Midrin (acetaminophen / dichloralphenazone / isometheptene mucate)	I've been taking Midrin for Migraine, Tension, Cluster and Combination  Headaches for 31 years. Midrin is the only thing that actually works for my headaches and I am still able to function at work as an RN after taking the Midrin. I've been begging my pain management doctor to send a prescription to a compounding pharmacy but they want to play the game of prescribing things that don't work first because this has the Isometheptene which is a Schedule 4 Controlled Substance which is the second lowest Schedule.	10	April 2, 2021	2
Acetaminophen, Isometheptene, and Dichloralphenazone	Midrin (acetaminophen / dichloralphenazone / isometheptene mucate)	I get terrible headaches due to cervical arthritis for several years now,   I have tried many  different  headache meds including  botox injections.    Nothing works.   Recently  a new  neurologist I have seen prescribed  Midrin.  After searching the area where I reside I found a compounding  pharmacy    where I get this wonder drug made. It has helped me get my life back again.   I  urge  everyone  who cannot  get this drug to write to the FDA to let them know how important it is to get this drug back to pharmacies throughout the country.  Also I urge everyone to contact your state senators  to  make  Midrin  payable through  medicare and other prescription plans as it is rather expensive.  This medication is a God send.	10	March 13, 2021	2
Acetaminophen, Isometheptene, and Dichloralphenazone		I’ve suffered from devastating episodes of migraine and tension headaches for over 30 years. In the early ‘90’s a neurologist at Duke started me on Fioricet which was a great step in the right direction until years later I discovered Midrin — which was like a miracle drug that finally, and for more than a decade, gave me back a normal life.  It was a inexcusable for the FDA remove it from the market for non-safety reasons without specifically identifying a superior alternative with the same mechanism of action. Since then, you name it and I’ve tried it...Imitrex, Rizatriptan, Fioricet again, Percocet, Valium, and others. Nothing has every been as clinically effective.	10	February 24, 2021	2
Acetaminophen, Isometheptene, and Dichloralphenazone	Midrin (acetaminophen / dichloralphenazone / isometheptene mucate)	I suffer from gilioblastoma (a rare form of Cancer).I was prescribed Midrin and it helped relieve the pressure and onset of pain. Now I am close to death. Thanks to the FDA. The pain is intolerable. I would prefer Midrin over my Fentanyl and Morphine dosages any day. How many more people have to die or understand the pain we all go through.	10	February 11, 2021	6
Acetaminophen, Isometheptene, and Dichloralphenazone		Migraines since my teens; clusters since 30; only efficient medication: Midrin. I now take ineffective triptans/opiates for migraines w/aura. For clusters, total misery for days wishing I could pound my head against a wall til it stops. I’m disabled; can’t afford formulation of midrin. Knowing there’s medication that’s SAFE &  EFFICIENT pulled for this reason disgusts me as an RN. I no longer work. 1 maybe 2 capsules, within 30 minutes I was a fully functioning acute care psych charge RN. I wonder if I won’t end up a patient due to lack of Midrin! FDA stop the refusing to reinstate Midrin, that has worked for years w/no hangover effects, drowsiness, nor rebound migraines for me & for dozens, hundreds of my former patients. Migraines ineffectively treated can lead to suicidal thoughts & behaviors. What will it take before realizing total cost of pulling this safe and efficient medication? Time to balance bureaucracy/red tape for common sense, decency & patient experiences!	10	September 23, 2020	3
Acetaminophen, Isometheptene, and Dichloralphenazone		Midrin is far superior for relieving my migraine headaches than any other medication I have tried. Very disappointed it is not currently on the market. I currently take Maxalt, but it is only mildly affective and my migraines tend to rebound much more with an increased duration. Please bring back Midrin!	10	September 11, 2020	3
Acetaminophen, Isometheptene, and Dichloralphenazone	Midrin (acetaminophen / dichloralphenazone / isometheptene mucate)	Midrin or the generic has worked wonders for me for over 30 years with no side effects.  Nothing else I tried has been as helpful.  I take is as soon as the aura starts and it stops it within 15 minutes.  I found a compounding pharmacy in Wildwood, Florida that is making it for me.  Thank Goodness!	10	February 18, 2020	14
Acetaminophen, Isometheptene, and Dichloralphenazone	Midrin (acetaminophen / dichloralphenazone / isometheptene mucate)	I've had hemiplegic migraines since I was 9 years old. I'm now 53.  Midrin is the only medication that works for me. It completely shuts down a migraine within 30 minutes. Although they are not as frequent as they were when I was younger, I still get one or two a year and without the Midrin, I will be in bed for 2 or 3 days, in severe pain, throwing up and not able to speak.  The Midrin I have now is 5 years old and doesn't work very well. I'm afraid of what will happen the next time I get a migraine.	10	January 11, 2020	14
Acetaminophen, Isometheptene, and Dichloralphenazone	Midrin (acetaminophen / dichloralphenazone / isometheptene mucate)	The manufacturers aren't making enough money on the OLD migraine meds (which MIDRIN is the only one that ever helped me) so they want to FORCE everyone to pay for the newer ones.	10	December 20, 2019	6
Acetaminophen, Isometheptene, and Dichloralphenazone	Midrin (acetaminophen / dichloralphenazone / isometheptene mucate)	I have been using Midrin for over 25 years for my severe migraines. I have been to 5 doctors, 3  Neurologist, multiple MRIs, about 25+ different medications. Come to find out the only medication that works for me is an old medication (Midrin). I used to have 3-4 migraines a week. With out Midrin I would have never been able to get a career job. Now that have got older . My migraines have decreased to about 1 migraines a month. I'm very luck to have them less than when I was younger. Now I find my self down 5 pills left and can't find them anywhere. Can't get them or get them compounded. After I use my last 5 pills. My migraines will last 3 days or so with out Midrin. With Midrin they last 2-4 hours. If I can't get Midrin I'm afraid I will loose my Job. I feel for anyone that  is in my same situation or worse than me.  They need to get it back on the market or just let us get it compounded again.	9	October 22, 2019	18
Acetaminophen, Isometheptene, and Dichloralphenazone	Amidrine (acetaminophen / dichloralphenazone / isometheptene mucate)	I have Chronic back and neck pain with headache. This is a No from me	2	October 16, 2019	0
Acetaminophen, Isometheptene, and Dichloralphenazone	Midrin (acetaminophen / dichloralphenazone / isometheptene mucate)	I've experienced migraines my entire life, and I've been taking Midrin for about 30 years now.  I don't have any side affects, and I'm able to function with the med, and with the headache.   As essential personnel 24/7 for law enforcement, Midrin kept me going and productive.  It is extremely frustrating that it has gone on and off the market many times over the years.  It's even more frustrating when it's such a common medicine, and now it's not available at all.  I've tried every other migraine meds, and I've been to countless neurologists, and Midrin is the only thing that actually works, and every time.  Come on FDA and pharmaceutical companies.  Let's get Midrin back into production and back into the hands of those of us that rely on it.		August 29, 2019	32
Acetaminophen, Isometheptene, and Dichloralphenazone	Midrin (acetaminophen / dichloralphenazone / isometheptene mucate)	Been using Midrin for headaches for over 30 years  with no side effects. It works in 30 minutes to stop my aura and headache. Please bring it back so I don't have to risk suffering again.	10	August 13, 2019	32
Acetaminophen, Isometheptene, and Dichloralphenazone	Midrin (acetaminophen / dichloralphenazone / isometheptene mucate)	I had my doctor write a prescription for the  acetaminophen/dichloralphenazone/isometheptene mucate formula instead of the name of the drug.  Then I took that to a compounding pharmacy and had them make it for me. The only downside is that my insurance won't cover the compounded drug, and it is pricey. But for the relief it gives, it's worth it. I am going to see if I can have the doctor write separate scripts for the components. Even though it means taking multiple pills, the insurance should cover it.	10	July 27, 2019	21
Acetaminophen, Isometheptene, and Dichloralphenazone	Midrin (acetaminophen / dichloralphenazone / isometheptene mucate)	I cannot tell you how devastated I am that I can no longer get Midrin. I Hate Imitrex, Midrin does not affect me poorly like other medications do. I can perform my duties at work and  it takes the edge off of  my migraine. As soon as I get an aura, I take a Midrin and within 15 minutes the edge is gone, now a severe migraine I will have to take up to 4 a day, but.... I'm down to my last 2 pills and I just want to cry. Come on FDA!!!!!	10	July 26, 2019	27
Acetaminophen, Isometheptene, and Dichloralphenazone		I can so relate to Everyone who have posted Taken midrin in the past.  It was the only med that gave me relief.  Now I’m taking fiorcet t3 methacarbamal and drinking whisky more than I should.  I am constantly dizzy and can’t function in my daily life. FDA please pull your collective heads out of your asses and fix this.  I’m begging you.	10	July 25, 2019	7
Acetaminophen, Isometheptene, and Dichloralphenazone	Midrin (acetaminophen / dichloralphenazone / isometheptene mucate)	"I have had migraines ALL of my life (at least 50% of my days on earth) but was not diagnosed until I was 40. I still remember the pain and extreme nausea in my high school days.  I went through 2 years of trial and error with a neurologist. Midrin is the only thing that worked. Midrin decreased the pain and nausea and let me function at a normal level. I could work, exercise, do social activities just like a normal person.  Now my alternatives are stronger, potentially addictive medications.  Way to go FDA. Try some common sense please and ""allow"" the millions of us  to have relief from migraines and live our lives. You allow drugs that cause permanent physical damage to remain on the market but ban this drug that has been around for decades without incident. You have NO clue. Or they aren't making billions of dollars off this drug so why bother."	10	July 13, 2019	28
Acetaminophen, Isometheptene, and Dichloralphenazone	Midrin (acetaminophen / dichloralphenazone / isometheptene mucate)	I have had a “classic migraine” condition for 40 years and a neurologist prescribed Midrin for my TIA-like symptoms. Neither Imitrex nor other triptan meds work to avert the aura, loss of vision, numbness or speech difficulties but a single Midrin capsule worked within 15 minutes to reduce or eliminate a full-on, persistent migraine headache. Please bring it back!!	10	June 27, 2019	26
Acetaminophen, Isometheptene, and Dichloralphenazone	Midrin (acetaminophen / dichloralphenazone / isometheptene mucate)	"I have suffered from the symptoms of migraine headaches for over 25 years and prescribed many popular migraine prescriptions without relief, but Midrin ""Always"" works.  Two Midrin capsules and within 30 minutes full symptom relief, but on occasion 1 extra capsule may be required to achieve full relief.   For those who don't understand, at the onset of a migraine or waking up at night to a full blown migraine, the headache symptoms are torturous and usually include nausea for hours until the inevitable violent vomiting.  Bring back my Midrin."	10	May 31, 2019	24
Acetaminophen, Isometheptene, and Dichloralphenazone	Midrin (acetaminophen / dichloralphenazone / isometheptene mucate)	How on earth can they discontinue this medication that has helped my  and others TREMENDOUSLY?! If you do not suffer from actual migraines ( I have Migraines with Aura )then you have absolutely NO idea what life is like for us. I have been taking this medicine for 20 years and now have nothing else that I am compatible with to use!	9	May 15, 2019	25
Acetaminophen, Isometheptene, and Dichloralphenazone	Midrin (acetaminophen / dichloralphenazone / isometheptene mucate)	I have been getting 40 Botox injections every ten weeks in my head and temples for the last 5 years to treat migraines that I have suffered with for 30+ years.  I have taken EVERY available medication and vitamin offered to combat them and suffered from being further triggered, allergic reactions, and becoming too incapacitated to care for my children or work.  Midrin has been the ONLY breakthrough medication to help me reduce the length and severity of the migraines I get between treatments. Why is it gone? It is the only medication that allows me to function between my treatments.  It has really impaired my abilities in so many ways.  It is WRONG to disarm us strong and struggling individuals of some peace and health. Clearly the medical decision makers have never gotten a migraine least of all 15+ monthly.	10	May 8, 2019	20
Acetaminophen, Isometheptene, and Dichloralphenazone		I've been taking Midrin since around 1990. It's the only thing that works for my migraine, cluster and tension headaches and now I'm suffering daily from headaches and no relief due to the unavailability of the Midrin and all generic forms of it. The FDA taking it off the market is a HUGE loss to headache sufferers all over. What a travesty and tragedy. What are you thinking?	10	February 27, 2019	5
Acetaminophen, Isometheptene, and Dichloralphenazone	Midrin (acetaminophen / dichloralphenazone / isometheptene mucate)	Miss Midrin, was the only thing that helped my migraines/headaches. I've held on to a few since may 2018, but I haven't found anything equal to it	10	February 21, 2019	17
Acetaminophen, Isometheptene, and Dichloralphenazone	Midrin (acetaminophen / dichloralphenazone / isometheptene mucate)	I have had Migraines for 25 years, My Neurologist just prescribed Midrin - I see that many can't get it from the pharmacy anymore which is what he told me - well, the way around that is: HE GAVE ME A SCRIPT TO HAVE A COMPOUND PHARMACY (which there are many) MAKE THE MIDRIN FOR ME - they will make THE EXACT FORMULA in capsule form.  It will not be covered by insurance but, I really don't care, when you have Migraine PAIN... money does not matter, which we all know.  I am taking it to the compound pharmacy tomorrow (I live in Phoenix AZ) to have it made.  Go to your doctor and ask for a script to have it made - look for a compound pharmacy in your area and get your migraine help back.  My Doctor said it would cost me about $100 to have it made.  If 100 dollars will stop that pain - I am there.  I have to say that I am feeling while lot better about this script thanks to your reviews!  Hope you all go have this made for you.  Oh, what was the substitute people were taking?	10	January 27, 2019	29
Acetaminophen, Isometheptene, and Dichloralphenazone		I was bedridden for 2 years for my debilitating migraine. I was prescribed Dilaudid by my neurologist. He had no idea how addictive the drug was and when he found out I  was sent to rehab to get off of it. The hospital prescribed me the generic for Midrin. It gave me my life back. I'm devastated because this drug is no longer available. I experienced my first pain level 10 and was confined to bed. Being bedridden due to my migraine is not an option. Please put it back on the market.	10	December 27, 2018	4
Acetaminophen, Isometheptene, and Dichloralphenazone		This medication changed my life for the good. I have taken it as needed for over 25 years without any side effects. Knowing this medication is no longer available has adversely impacted the quality of my thought life. This medication worked every time. No more  costly pain filled trips to the ER. No more missed work. Now, my life will never be the same. I am not alone as this medication has been a miracle to others as well. Now my medical bills and lost wages will sky rocket. These other medications are not safe and I won't take them. I just hope that somehow this medication can soon be available again. My life is not the same without it.	10	December 23, 2018	3
Acetaminophen, Isometheptene, and Dichloralphenazone	Midrin (acetaminophen / dichloralphenazone / isometheptene mucate)	"I have had migraines since 2008, I went through every kind of pill imaginable until my Neurologist prescribed Midrin-finally something that actually worked! Then after a couple years it was nowhere to be found and therefore I suffered horribly trying to get by with Naproxen which is basically useless. Last year I was able to get Midrin again-even though I have to pay $4 a pill for it-it's cheaper than a trip to the ER for the ""really bad ones"". Fast forward to couple a months ago, I went from 2 different Rite Aids to then 2 different Walgreens getting my Midrin filled is always a rigamarol. Today I called to see if my prescription was ready and they said Midrin and equivalents were discontinued! I am freaking  out-this is the ONLY thing that works for my bad migraines. Please FDA figure out what you need to and get this stuff back on the shelves!"	10	December 18, 2018	21
Acetaminophen, Isometheptene, and Dichloralphenazone	Midrin (acetaminophen / dichloralphenazone / isometheptene mucate)	I was born w migraines. So I tried many many many different migraine meds.  Only mildrin relieved my pain. And I had no side effects. W the others meds my throat was so dry couldn’t swallow.  And my heart had palpitations and I felt like a zombie.  Please FDA put midrin back on the pharmacies. You have no idea that midrin has the least harmful side effects	10	December 10, 2018	14
Acetaminophen, Isometheptene, and Dichloralphenazone	Midrin (acetaminophen / dichloralphenazone / isometheptene mucate)	It was the best cheap drug for migraines.  Nobody wants to make it now because it doesn’t make pharmaceuticals enough money.   What is the FDA thinking?   All those years, no deaths and I don’t know of any serious side effects.   And it worked for many people.  Even migraine headache clinic wrote scripts for it all the time.  Because it worked.  Now FDA markets all kinds of drugs which cause serious side effects and death.   I understand the rules for FDA has changed and more stringent now.  So new studies, new manufacturers and prices are jacked up.  And worst of all, we still get migraines with no Midrin	10	November 30, 2018	17
Acetaminophen, Isometheptene, and Dichloralphenazone	Midrin (acetaminophen / dichloralphenazone / isometheptene mucate)	I suffered many years  with migraine headaches so severe that they would render me useless for anything for a day or two.  Because of the headaches, I would worry and be anxious about when the next one would come.  As a result, they became more frequent eventually occurring about once a week.  I tried many pain-relieving drugs and doctors without success.  Eventually, I found a doctor who suggested Midrin even though he didn't know if it would help.  He prescribed a total of 6 pills over a 5-hour period to relieve pain.  I found that it completely removed pain after 1 tablet.  I also felt more relaxed (less anxious).   The headaches became less frequent to the point that I might go for a year without a headache.  Just having the Midrin with me helped tremendously.	10	November 27, 2018	11
Acetaminophen, Isometheptene, and Dichloralphenazone	Midrin (acetaminophen / dichloralphenazone / isometheptene mucate)	I have suffered from terrible migraines for many many years. Tried many different things from my family doctor and nothing would take away my headaches. Finally my Dr sent me to a neurologist and she put me on midrin and it was a miracle !  I took my first midrin pill and Just like that, (snap), my headache goes away!  Usually only need one to get rid of it, on rare occasion had to take another. It never failed me and I had zero side effects and did not ever feel high or impaired in any way whatsoever. And it is not addictive!  And I agree with the other lady that commented on this medication, we need to start a petition or send letters or call the surgeon general or someone in the government to stop this insanity of not permitting this long time, proven safe and effective and non addictive medicine that has hardly any side affects (in most cases NO SIDE EFFECTS) tried and true for decades migraine.  Lets get  MEDICATION back in pharmacy's in America!	10	September 26, 2018	18
Acetaminophen, Isometheptene, and Dichloralphenazone	Midrin (acetaminophen / dichloralphenazone / isometheptene mucate)	I used to have bad migraines and I could ALWAYS count on Midrin to stop it in short time. In the 1980'S when I took it, it would give you a distinct celery taste in your mouth as you felt your headache melt away. I eventually quit getting headaches...until recently. I was surprised that my doctors were unfamiliar with  Midrin since it was so effective. But I was even more surprised to learn that Midrin in its original form, was discontinued. Why?? Anyway, tonight  I bought a generic version, which was NOT covered by my insurance. No classic celery taste any more and it took a little longer, but my headache is 90% gone after 1 hour. Not as good as the original but still great med.	10	September 20, 2018	6
Acetaminophen, Isometheptene, and Dichloralphenazone	Midrin (acetaminophen / dichloralphenazone / isometheptene mucate)	Midrin was the best migraine medication! As far as I know I cannot get it anywhere in the area that I live locally in Lake City Florida. I was reading this post to see if anyone had any ideas. I guess I will check on having it compounded at a pharmacy. I have tried Fioricet and fiorinal and they work but my doctor does not like to prescribe them because they have the potential for dependency. She has prescribed for me amerge, it is a triptan and it works but my insurance does not want to pay for it. I do have high blood pressure and sometimes it affects that. Sometimes I use toradol and that works, but it cannot be used regularly.	10	September 8, 2018	5
Acetaminophen, Isometheptene, and Dichloralphenazone	Epidrin (acetaminophen / dichloralphenazone / isometheptene mucate)	Coping with photophobia and migraine with aura for over 20 years has been a disabling part of my life.  I have been getting 40 injections every 10 weeks and this medication is the ONLY breakthrough medication that allows me to resume any daily activities during a migraine until my next course of treatment. Other medications have exacerbated my symptoms or added new side effects that make it intolerable. This has allowed me to live as normal a life as I can.	10	August 17, 2018	1
Acetaminophen, Isometheptene, and Dichloralphenazone	Midrin (acetaminophen / dichloralphenazone / isometheptene mucate)	Midrin is the only medication that I have had success with to combat a migraine.  I could take it at the onset of a migraine to stop the pain dead in it's tracks.  I'm currently taking Sumatriptan (generic Imitrex) which makes me sleepy enough to sleep through the pain but doesn't always elevate the pain. I've been researching Midrin today to learn whether or not it will ever be available again for migraines but I'm not having much luck.  Posting here to see if anyone knows the status and to ask other what meds they used if Imitrex didn't work for them.	10	August 16, 2018	5
Acetaminophen, Isometheptene, and Dichloralphenazone	Migrex (acetaminophen / dichloralphenazone / isometheptene mucate)	I’ve taken one pill a day and it stopped headache in about an hour but headache didn’t return for 24 hours.  I was afraid to take migrex because company didn’t require prescription.  I think it has different ingredients depending on the country it is from. Also, it contains Tylenol (under the chemical name acetaminophen). I took the drug because I have severe pain almost 3/4 of the month and I had such a horrid headache I wouldn’t have cared if migrex killed me. What a surprise! I have imitrex and am suppose to use sumatriptan stat and migrex long term. Odd company didn’t require prescription??? That makes me nervous.	10	June 17, 2018	1
Acetaminophen, Isometheptene, and Dichloralphenazone		I have a history of migraines with aura (my mom has them too), and a few years ago my doctor prescribed me generic Midrin when I was having some of the most excruciating migraines of my life because of hormone fluctuations. I was very sceptical that it would do anything more than ibuprofen or excedrin ever had, but was blown away that it actually reduced 95% my symptoms when they struck! I didn't think anything could actually cover up the pain and nausea and sensitivity. I now keep a bottle of Midrin handy in my medicine cabinet for when I get those debilitating migraines that nothing else will touch. Thankfully I don't get them too often since Medicaid won't cover it and the cost is 180$... :(	9	March 17, 2018	1
Acetaminophen, Isometheptene, and Dichloralphenazone	Midrin (acetaminophen / dichloralphenazone / isometheptene mucate)	Midrin was the most effective medication I've ever taken for migraine. I can not take triptans as they cause my blood pressure to rise dangerously. When it was discontinued I was given multi other drugs to use without success. Now I stick with over the counter and suffer when they are ineffective.	9	February 16, 2018	6
Acetaminophen, Isometheptene, and Dichloralphenazone	Midrin (acetaminophen / dichloralphenazone / isometheptene mucate)	Midrin is the only medication that has worked for my migraines.	10	January 17, 2018	8
Acetaminophen, Isometheptene, and Dichloralphenazone		Loved Loved Loved this medication. It knocked my headaches out in 10 minutes and It also reduced the amount of times I got them. I was so sad when my doctor stopped proscribing them to me due to my insurance		December 22, 2017	3
Acetaminophen, Isometheptene, and Dichloralphenazone	Midrin (acetaminophen / dichloralphenazone / isometheptene mucate)	Like previous reviewers, I find the Midrin substitute hit-or-miss. Taking Midrin early or late in the headache seems not to matter; sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't. I took Midrin in the early 80s, and it worked every time, and fast. (the effect was as if my head just floated away, but I could still function). With the Midrin substitutes, the headache just slowly subsides. Either the formula is different or I am, but it's not the product it used to be. Still, it's the only thing that comes close to working for me.	8	June 2, 2017	9
Acetaminophen, Isometheptene, and Dichloralphenazone		The only thing that works for the complex migraines w/ vertigo and gastroparesis that I get as a result from a vagal nerve injury.    Other migraine medications have caused heart complications, so this is it for me.  It's terrifying whenever there's a shortage.	10	May 5, 2017	1
Acetaminophen, Isometheptene, and Dichloralphenazone	Midrin (acetaminophen / dichloralphenazone / isometheptene mucate)	For me Midrin is very hit or miss, when I take it at onset of a bad headache, sometimes the headache just in time vanishes before it ever begins, then sometimes its as if I took a placebo, granted the drug has 0 side effects for me.  Overall, it's worth having if you have back-up drugs for when it does not work. For those of you that like myself get a terrible trifecta of Migraine, Tension, and Cluster Headaches. You probably know like me that no meds really take the headache away completely once you have one.	6	April 11, 2017	5
Acetaminophen, Isometheptene, and Dichloralphenazone	Midrin (acetaminophen / dichloralphenazone / isometheptene mucate)	I began having vascular migraines in the  70s and nothing worked until I was prescribed midrin.  My rating is for the current midrin formula as it doesn't seem to work as well as it did back in the day when I was first prescribed it... back then it far surpassed 10!  It is still an effective migraine drug with less side effects than some other drugs that I was prescribed when midrin was unavailable.  It works quickly and, unless it is a really bad migraine, basically allows me to still be able to function once the headache subsides.   Currently, my Medicare drug plan doesn't cover it and it is expensive--- over $3.00 a capsule, unless you can find a coupon.   Last time it was filled I had a coupon and paid $1.12 a capsule.	7	April 8, 2017	9
Acetaminophen, Isometheptene, and Dichloralphenazone	Midrin (acetaminophen / dichloralphenazone / isometheptene mucate)	"As of this review (Spring 2017) only one company makes it (Macoven Pharma.) It is the best migraine treatment for me whatever variation of name it is dispensed as: ""Midrin"" ""Commonly known as Midrin"" ""Epidrin"" ""isometheptene-dichloralphenazone-acetaminophen"" ""Isometh/Dich/Apap 65-100-325.""  At onset of migraine I take 2 capsules Midrin and 20-30 minutes later the migraine just starts to disappear. Make me sleepy - that's the only downside and one I can manage. Usually first dose is enough, occasionally I take one more Midrin capsule an hour later. I went through years trying out various Rx's, shots, treatments with my doctor, but once we tried Midrin I got my life back. Difficult to find pharmacy to supply, but worth it!"	10	March 20, 2017	23
Acetaminophen, Isometheptene, and Dichloralphenazone		Midrin, Epidrin, isometheptene-dichloralphenazone-acetaminophen, Isometh/Dich/Apap 65-100-325, whatever variation of name it is dispensed as, it is the best migraine treatment for me. It must be administered early into the headache or it is much less effective. That's the only downside, and one I've managed to deal with successfully over many years now.  I take 2 capsules at onset and one more tablet each hour after as needed (usually total of three capsules is enough!) Only side affect is it makes me sleepy. I went through two years trying out various Rx's, shots, treatments with my doctor, but once we tried Midrin I got my life back.The difficulty getting it lately has me jumping through hoops and the price skyrocketed, but it's worth it.	10	March 10, 2017	2
Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Goody's Headache Powders (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Migraine	This is my only go to for headaches which I frequently keep. I have multiple a week and have depended on these packets for years. I do not like the new packaging. It’s hard to get it all out I have to blow in the end to open it up fighting to get the last little bit out. By that time and tasting the other that’s been hanging around in my mouth waiting for me to swallow. The consistency has changed and is gritty.  Please bring back the old ones	5	April 16, 2021	0
Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Excedrin Migraine (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Migraine	I started using Excedrin Migraine in my twenties for migraines. I'm now 62 and continue to use it. It's a MIRACLE  drug for me. I do get stomach upset from it, so try to take it with food. Can't take it around bedtime because I could never sleep (caffeine is in it). I take one pill. I took 2 once and the shakiness and anxiety were through the roof. I hope they never stop manufacturing this product.	10	April 12, 2021	0
Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Excedrin Migraine (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Migraine	I have always used Excedrin migraine to get rid of my headaches for years. Then all of a sudden it was pulled off the market I would find an occasional bottle usually at a Dollar store and when I did it was like finding gold. Then nothing. But just the other day I found a horde of the product at a Family Dollar store. I took two yesterday afternoon for my head ache then went out later and ate a mushroom burger and got deathly ill from food poisoning. I vomited all night and thought it may had been from taking the Excedrin but that was not it. It is now several hours later after a terrible night and my head was killing me. I read where several people had taken only one pill and it helped. Now that I found the horde of 35 boxes of Excedrin I am not worried about running out.  This is the only medication that works for me. I got a concussion 28 years ago and none of the high power drugs worked until I found Excedrin Migraine. How come nothing else works for me?	10	April 6, 2021	0
Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Arthriten (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Pain/Fever	Arthriten works well.  The first time I took it it provided tremendous relief.  However, I needed to take it again but the bottle has no information on the proper dosage.  I don’t remember if it’s 1 or 2 tablets.	9	April 2, 2021	0
Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Goody's Extra-Strength Headache Powders (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Pain/Fever	Wow! So many people with the same complaint.  I hope the company is listening.  I actually sought out a review board because the new packaging is just so bad. I also tried emailing the company and got no reply. Definitely feels like you get less product and half of what you do gets stuck in the corners. I'm begging this company to go back to the old packaging.	4	March 30, 2021	0
Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Goody's Extra-Strength Headache Powders (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Pain/Fever	I do not like the new goody powder on the go pack . I can't  get all the  powder out of it unless I tear it down the side like taking the original goody powder. I also can't put the pack in my back pocket so anyway I have been taking goody powders for 28 years and now I have now swapped to take aspirin or tylenol	10	March 25, 2021	1
Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Excedrin Migraine (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Migraine	Followed instructions on the bottle and the pill caused me to have panic attacks to the point of I was hyperventilating and wanting to pass out. Had to be taken to the hospital so they can give me a injection to counteract the excedrin. I threw away the pills and I do not recommend. Also did not help with the migraines.	1	March 21, 2021	0

Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Excedrin Migraine (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Migraine	My fiancé swears by this stuff for his migraines but I’ve tried taking excedrin twice now for my headaches and both times I’ve literally felt like I was dying. Shortness of breath, numbness in my body, cold sweats, nausea and chest pains. I don’t know what causes this but it’s literally the worst feeling and lasts for hours and hours.	1	February 21, 2021	0
Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Excedrin Migraine (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Migraine	I was looking for somewhere I could leave a review about excedrin migraine because that's how amazing it is. I had a throbbing and painful migraine for 2 days that was causing neck, shoulder, and upper back pain. I thought it was a sinus headache but it was horrible and after taking ibuprofen like crazy it would not go away. It was so bad I could barely get out of bed and I wasn't even hungry, instead I felt physically sick. I did not understand the severity of migraines until I started getting them myself. My dad went out and bought me excedrin migraine at my request after googling how to stop the pain. I took it and within 10-15 minutes my migraine had subsided. I could move and bend without my head throbbing. This was an about 40 mins ago. I still have some neck, shoulder, and back pain and my head still feels a lil groggy but I am so much better and no longer debilitated and nauseous. This is some powerful stuff!	10	February 7, 2021	0
Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Goody's Extra-Strength Headache Powders (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Migraine	I have used Goody Powders for 15+ years for migraines. I had tried over 100 medications that did not work but goody powders did. With this new packaging, and I'm wondering if you didn't change the formula, I have to take 3 just to get rid of my migraine and get enough in my mouth! Its not easier, its not better! Until about a year ago I was lucky enough to find the old ones here and there but that ran out and now I have to use the new. Now I'm looking for something that will actually work since you screwed the pooch and changed the medicine.	3	January 9, 2021	0
Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Excedrin Migraine (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Migraine	This medication takes the pain away but the last time I took it I had terrible anxiety. I felt nauseous and shaky  and nothing would take the feeling away. I had to deal with it for a while and it felt horrible. I usually take half of one pill but last time I took a whole.	3	January 6, 2021	0
Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Excedrin Migraine (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Migraine	This is the single worst experience of my life.  Gor 6-7 hours I was debilitatingly nauseous, my heart rate was incredibly high, and my migraine was still at its height. This was on new year’s eve. I was convinced it was the end of my life.	1	January 1, 2021	0
Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Excedrin (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Migraine	I rather take Excedrin before a prescription medicine from my doctor.  Don’t take on an empty stomach. If you can’t take anything with caffeine in it don’t take it.  If you have headaches that you can’t live or function with then there is a problem go to your doctor. Excedrin is only for temporary pain reliever and if the pain comes back again then you got a problem go to your Dr. A lot of times when you get those kind of migraine headaches. It could be your diet the foods that you’re eating your living situation could bring on allergies like smells, dirt, dust dog ,cat hair even air we breathe it’s all.  Maybe get some exercise get your blood moving always helped.	10	December 27, 2020	0
Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Excedrin (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Migraine	I have severe migraines at least twice a week and a constant headache the rest of the time, likely having something to do with previous concussions and head injuries. No amount of OTC drugs or combinations have seemed to help and neither have any other at home headache/migraine treatments. Excedrin migraine does relive some of the headache pain but intensifies a lot of my other symptoms to the point where it is not worth it. Within an hour of taking it I end up disoriented and quite dizzy, the dizziness being normal for my migraines but once again intensified when I take excedrin.	3	December 20, 2020	0

Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Excedrin Migraine (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Migraine	Excedrin Migraine gets rid of a bad migraine within 2 hours of taking it.

Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Excedrin (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Migraine	I've taken Excedrin for headaches and body aches since 1972, when I was in the US Army.  Works very well most of the time.  The only time I had a problem, was many years ago, I got a bottle that must have turned bad or expired.  Had a vinegar smell, and caused dizziness within a short time of taking it.  Advice, if the medicine has a sour smell, the aspirin content may have been altered, by age, or moisture, etc.  Do not use.	10	November 19, 2020	1

They come on suddenly like getting hit in the head.   I have tried all the prescription meds. They made me sick.  They also did not help that much.

I am SO grateful to have found help !!!!!!!"	10	October 5, 2020	1
Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Vanquish (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Migraine	I've used Vanquish for decades , since I was a teen (I'm 38yrs now).  Works great for general headaches; tension, barometric pressure, and sinus headaches.  No side effects.  Takes about 20 mins to kick in.  One dose ends the headache.  I always keep a supply with me.  Unfortunately, it does absolutely nothing for my migraines.	8	August 28, 2020	1
Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Goody's Extra-Strength Headache Powders (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine)	So with all these comments showing the dislike of the new packaging WHY aren’t they listening , and bringing the old style back ?

Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Excedrin Migraine (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Migraine	I had a spinal fluid leak and a spinal headache that resulted in a grand mal seizure after my daughter was born in January 2019. Since then I have had horrendous migraines and headaches. Excedrin Migraine literally works in minutes for me...I woke up this morning at 5am with the worst headache I have felt since she was born, I thought I was going to pass out. I took 2 Excedrin Migraine and within 20 minutes my head felt 99% better. I am still nauseated and fatigued but the pain is gone. So thankful for this medication. I avoid medication at all costs but this is a life saver!	10	August 14, 2020	3

Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Excedrin (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Migraine	I’ve had a migraine for about 4 days now. It was helping in the beginning, but I took it and now my heart rate is sky rocketing. I feel dizzy and can’t fall asleep. I’m hoping this goes away soon, it is a very odd sensation. It kept me up all night. I just want to sleep! :(	3	June 16, 2020	5
Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Excedrin Migraine (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Migraine	I get really bad migraines from time to time because of weather changes. None of the other headache medications really do much for me, especially when the migraines get so bad I can’t get out of bed. Excedrin migraine has become my go-to when this happens. Depending on how bad the migraine is, it can take anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour to help enough to get me moving again, but it helps a lot when it does. The symptoms don’t always disappear completely (today, for instance, I’m still feeling a bit nauseous after taking it), but they become a lot more manageable and I’m able to get out of bed and get through my day, and the light and sound sensitivity is almost completely gone.	9	April 29, 2020	3
Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Goody's Headache Powders (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Pain/Fever	I had to stop taking Goodys due to irritation of my throat.  I can't take it at all on my tongue, but I can get it down if I dissolve it in water.  I immediately get a reaction in my throat and cough for five minutes.  I suffer from acid reflux and maybe that is the problem.  If I am right, that should be listed as a side effect or warning.  I wish I could tolerate it because it does the job	8	April 25, 2020	2

Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Goody's Headache Powders (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Pain/Fever	By far your worst decision was to change the packaging. Did anyone ever test the new packaging before production?  Apparently not. Something needs to be changed. New “ sticks on the go “ packets will remain on the shelf when I walk by.

Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Extra Pain Relief (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Pain/Fever	I have a broken wisdom tooth, and for the past 2 weeks I've been in almost unbearable pain at points. Ibuprofen, Tylenol, etc never even touched the pain. Ice would numb it. But a friend suggested excedrin and I took it and within 15 mins my pain was gone. It is amazing. I didn't think anything would even remotely help it outside of a dentist visit, and low and behold this medicine is amazing. I can function like a normal human being again until I can get in to my dentist. Highly recommend.	10	March 1, 2020	0
Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Excedrin Migraine (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Migraine	I have been suffering from bad headaches for a few years now.

Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	PainAid Extra-Strength Formula (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Pain/Fever	Used this for TMJ pain instead of narcotics. Relief comes fast. The only OTC that works: Excedrin.  I have used generic brands Wal mart. Walgreens or Meijers brands of Excedrin too. All are great. I go by cost and coupons. Tylenol alone does nothing. Advil works sometimes but causes stomach irritation.  Excedrin can cause a spike in blood pressure which is monitored. My endocrinologist monitors but approves Excedrin.	10	February 5, 2020	0
Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Excedrin Migraine (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Migraine	Excedrin migraine works when nothing else does! I have had severe migraines since I was 5 years old. Tylenol and ibuprofen wouldn’t work. I’ve been so glad that excedrin migraine was invented. After having a glass of water two pills and something to eat (like toast or crackers) It only takes 20 minutes to kick in.	10	January 27, 2020	3

Also takes away aches and pains from muscles since I am  heavy gardener. It has been the ONLY way I can stop headaches, and nearly all aches and pains.  So grateful that it is on the market. It has saved me from a painful life.	10	December 11, 2019	13
Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Excedrin Migraine (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Pain/Fever	This medicine is the best. I have taken it for headaches, migraines, pains in foot and elsewhere throughout my body. Most of the time comfort comes in just a few minutes. Occasionally it does take longer or requires a second dose. Very rare though.  I recommend if you are having to take these daily like I did to also get a stool softener as it can sometimes lead to constipation.  Overall I take this instead of the Narcotics that doctors seem to want everyone to be hooked on. I only have to these every now and then now. I hope this helps someone looking for pain relief.	10	December 10, 2019	5
Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Excedrin (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Pain/Fever	Excedrin is my go to for headaches and general aches and pains.

Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Excedrin (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Migraine	I got this medication from my doctor to treat weekly migraines. However, I found that this medication has only made my migraines more frequent! If I take it one day, it’ll return the next day. I never used to wake up with headaches, but now every morning is tainted with migraine. If I can catch my headache in time, it gets rid of the headache but introduces shakiness, dizziness, and stomach pain. If I wait too long to take the medication (i.e. wake up with a full-blown migraine) then it still causes these side effects, but combined with the headache, nausea, and dizziness of migraine, I feel 10x worse. Without my headache, side effects are bearable. With it, though, I really just want to blink out of existence. Take with caution or avoid all together. My migraine days have increased 7-fold since taking this medication.	3	December 7, 2019	4
Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Goody's Headache Powders (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Migraine	I love these.

The person or persons that designed or advised this change needs a new profession. You know the old saying “If it ain’t broke don’t fix it”.

I found Goody's a couple years ago. Instant head and body ache relief. Loved the little gum wrapper doses. Then they changed to their new ""On The Go Stick Packs""! What a worthless terrible inconvenient way to package such a great product. You tear one end and try to pour it in your mouth but most gets stuck in the back of the little plastic infused paper pouch. You must flick and jiggle the pouch spraying contents all over your face and clothes. I sent them an email and the response was pathetic. I have not bought any since. Excedrin is the same ingredients. Just chew them up so they work fast. Bye Bye Goody's."	10	November 15, 2019	11
Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Excedrin Migraine (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Migraine	Hello everyone  I have had migraines for over 8 years now, I am 28 years old male. 5 years ago I went to gas station at 4 am to grab some kind of pain reliever as I was having a migraine and saw the Excedrin Migraine pill. I tried and my life changed since. Start with 1 pill and see how long does it take into effect. I usually take 1 pill when I feel a little pain (just means I am gonna have a bad migraine soon) if the migraine pain is already there I take two  For me at least it takes 30 -45 minutes and no pain.	9	November 7, 2019	12
Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Excedrin Migraine (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Migraine	I have a love/hate relationship with this medication. I've had migraines since I was a child, but I also have anxiety. This is the only medication that takes my migraines away. However, it can also cause anxiety/panic symptoms, especially lightheaded feeling and fast heartbeat. I only take one with food and a lot of water. So it's either deal with the pain, or uncomfortable anxiety symptoms for awhile.	7	November 4, 2019	7
Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Goody's Extra-Strength Headache Powders (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Migraine	Why, why did they change the packaging? So much more difficult to get at, a terrible idea. Go back to the drawing board,  and leave it alone already!	8	October 31, 2019	5
Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Goody's Extra-Strength Headache Powders (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Pain/Fever	"The ""NEW"" packaging worsens my pain. Searching for a new/better OTC pain reliever."	1	October 21, 2019	12
Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Goody's Extra-Strength Headache Powders (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Migraine	I hate the new packaging. It tastes and feels different. Please change back!	6	October 17, 2019	3
Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Goody's Extra-Strength Headache Powders (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine)	Thw powders are great. I have used for years. New package system is THE WORST EVER.	7	October 15, 2019	1
Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Goody's Extra-Strength Headache Powders (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Pain/Fever	Forced to get what little product one can before tearing the package in tweezer fashion and having to hit somewhere around one’s mouth with the remainder. What an absolutely asinine idea. Not worth the effort anymore...		October 10, 2019	10
Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Excedrin Migraine (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Migraine	I would like to thank Excedrin. Within 3 minutes of taking it, I could feel it taking my headache away every second after until my headache was completely gone. I will continue to recommend this product to friends and family for life. Thank you.	10	October 10, 2019	5
Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Goody's Extra-Strength Headache Powders (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Migraine	I HATE the new packaging ---- I can not get all of the powder out of the package. My parents are in their 80s and are having more difficulties than I am due to age and arthritis. They literally have to cut the package open and pour contents in a spoon.  Bring back old packaging!!!!!!!!!!!	9	October 6, 2019	4
Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Excedrin (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Migraine	I want to express how much I appreciate this medication! I get migraines every now and again that even prescription medications didn’t help. But excedrin seems to help almost 100 percent of the time and I am So grateful because I am able to actually function and get through the day without having to suffer!!! Thank you so much!!!	10	October 6, 2019	4
Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Goody's Extra-Strength Headache Powders (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Pain/Fever	I hope that the Prestige Brands Company gets their heads out of their . butts and changes back to the old packaging.  I for one am searching for another product that is more user friendly. Listen to the users!	8	October 4, 2019	15
Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Excedrin Migraine (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Migraine	I've suffered from migraines ever since I was a child. The only ways I use to be able to combat them was to either sleep it off (which hardly ever worked) or throw up, which always worked but feels like absolute awful when you have a migraine. Thank goodness for Excedrin Migraine. Ibuprofen, Tylenol, none of it works; because there made to combat stuff like normal everyday pain, but a migraine is far from being a common discomfort. It won't work immediately, like every medication, but lay still in bed for half an hour after taking it... And you'll be shocked when you roll out of bed without your head beginning to pound and throb, best medication ever	10	October 2, 2019	5
Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Goody's Extra-Strength Headache Powders (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Pain/Fever	"Agreed. I hate the new ""Stick Packs."" I think they call it that because the powder ""sticks"" in the pack. This is another example of some marketing department that has never actually used the product it promotes.   When I am forced to buy these, I dump the powder into the old wraps and take those with me."	1	October 1, 2019	14
Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Goody's Extra-Strength Headache Powders (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Pain/Fever	New packaging is garbage. If it's not broke don't fix it. The greed in saving a penny to buy CEO's 6th vacation home, will cause long time customers like myself to go elsewhere.		September 29, 2019	14
Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Goody's Extra-Strength Headache Powders (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Migraine	I have been a long user of Goody Headache powder.  In my opinion it is the quickest and surest way to cure an annoying headache.  I will say though, that I despise the new packaging.  They are NOT more convientent in the least and impossible to get all the Goody out of.  Horrible decision.	8	September 25, 2019	2
Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Goody's Extra-Strength Headache Powders (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Pain/Fever	Maybe the managers bought stock in Excedrin, that's the only reason I can see for such a universally hated change. It worked! I can just crush an excedrin when I get a headache, at least I'll get all I paid for - and not just wear it on my front	1	September 25, 2019	10
Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Excedrin Migraine (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Migraine	Excedrin migraine is the only thing that works for my migraines. Because I try my best not to take medicine I will do everything to not take a pill unless I have to . Because I’ve learned that sometimes headaches come from dehydration I try my best to gulf down bottles of water . In this instance I lasted 3 days without taking medicine . I couldn’t take it no more . Soo finally took 2 Excedrins and within an hour I’m already feeling relief . This medicine is really a miracle medicine for me . Thank you !		September 22, 2019	7
Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Goody's Extra-Strength Headache Powders (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Migraine	I have used Goody’s since I was 18. I get migraines so bad that if I didn’t take a goody before the migraine kicked in, then I have to set in the dark, deal with nausea, and most importantly miss time out with family. The migraines would get so bad that my head would be so sore. All of this was due to the depo shot. I tried a Goody powder and it was amazing that I could take one right when I felt one coming on and it would stop it. Now not even two will touch my migraines. The taste is bitter the package is not easily opened and not convenient at all. The other package they was in, were so easy to take and now you literally have to tap the pack to take it. They suck and I have been taking them for over 20 years now. I won’t be buying them anymore.        Sincerely your unhappy ex customer, Lilbit.	1	September 21, 2019	2
Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Excedrin Migraine (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Migraine	My wife has suffered from migraines since a child. I’ve seen her take several things over the years and nothing ever worked. I’ve seen her sick for days on end vomiting so hard she loses all since of time. Then I see your commercials for migraines, this company has no idea what a migraine even is, please stop making claims your medicine is for migraines. My wife finds some relief in Maxalt and that doesn’t always work. Just hype is all your selling.	1	September 17, 2019	4
Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Goody's Extra-Strength Headache Powders (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Migraine	"WHYYYYY was the packaging changed. Worst mistake ever...They were ""on the go"" packs in the first place. Horrible decision. I also have to take 2 instead of 1 now. Just ridiculous all the way around. Change is good but not for Goodys."	1	September 16, 2019	6
Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Goody's Extra-Strength Headache Powders (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Pain/Fever	Hate the new packaging.. can't get them open easily, and the powder will not come out. Will no longer use.		September 13, 2019	14
Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Goody's Extra-Strength Headache Powders (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Pain/Fever	TERRIBLE CHANGE to the Goody's  packaging!!!  WHY?	10	September 12, 2019	16
Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Goody's Extra-Strength Headache Powders (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Pain/Fever	I used to love the old Goodies in the old packages but they taste different they don’t work so I say, don’t buy the new ones. They will see that they need to change back. Coke helped the headache.	1	September 11, 2019	9
Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Excedrin Migraine (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Migraine	This stuff the only thing that help my cluster headaches	10	September 1, 2019	4
Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Goody's Extra-Strength Headache Powders (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Pain/Fever	Who is the brainiac that decided to change packaging?  Be transparent to the consumers and explain.  Terrible mistake, someone needs to be fired!	5	August 28, 2019	17
Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Goody's Extra-Strength Headache Powders (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Pain/Fever	Love the Goody's Powder extra strength but I'm disliking these new power packets. The powder sticks to the package and in the corners. This new package was the worst thing the company could have ever done. Yes the new package allows you to carry individual packs with you but are more of a hassle to get the powder out of the package than it's worth. Bring back the original packets or sell both side by side and let the consumer decide. Contemplating finding a new over the counter headache medicine.	6	August 26, 2019	19
Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Goody's Extra-Strength Headache Powders (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Pain/Fever	It’s not just the new packaging it’s the formula  it has changed and is horrible I’ve taken Goody's for 30 years . This is such a big disappointment .This company is going to sink fast !!!! This was a huge mistake!!!!!!!!!!!!	1	August 26, 2019	24
Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Goody's Headache Powders (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Migraine	I took this stuff and now I am dying because of it.	1	August 25, 2019	3
Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Goody's Extra-Strength Headache Powders (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Pain/Fever	The new packaging stinks. Usually a large portion of the powder gets stuck in the bottom of the packet. When that happens instead on one clean dose in the back of your throat, now it dribbles out onto the tongue (which is a very bitter tasting ordeal). When the old pack emptied in to the rear of the throat there was minimal issue with bitterness. This  is something that was not broken and did not need fixing. . What idiot thought this was a good idea?  I have used Goody's Powder for decades. I am going elsewhere.	7	August 22, 2019	21
Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Excedrin Migraine (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Migraine	I’ve had migraines since I was 16 (now 18) and Excedrin and I have a love hate relationship. When I first started getting migraines I’d take two excedrin, drink a bottle of Mountain Dew and be good to go. The past 6-8 months or so every time I take it my anxiety spikes and I’m not able to stay still or relax. (it could be due to the caffeine in the excedrin and the caffeine in the mountain dew)  I’ve had anxiety since I was a kid so it’s weird this is just starting. Also, sometimes it will work and sometimes it won’t. Sometimes I have to take a few month break for it to work again.  I use to swear by it but now I’m just kinda meh. Try to avoid taking it if I can.	6	August 20, 2019	3
Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Goody's Extra-Strength Headache Powders (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Pain/Fever	The new packaging is horrible!  Absolutely horrible!  I have tried several methods to dispense the product, and there isn't a good way!  Plus, I am not convinced it is the same formulation.  PLEASE bring back the old packaging!  Been using Goody's for 40 years, and I am about to stop as soon as I can't find the other.	10	August 19, 2019	14
Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Goody's Extra-Strength Headache Powders (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Pain/Fever	I am so happy to see that I am not the only one that thinks this new packaging is a scam. Half the meds go in the trash. Waste of money. Waste of time. Even Dale Earnhardt jr as a sponsor. Just makes him look like a big fat liar. And so many in the south love and trust him. Huge disappointment!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! After 20 years of using Goodies. I will NEVER buy this product again. Advil will be my new love. At least with a tablet I know I am getting the whole med. Not just half.	5	August 17, 2019	16
Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Goody's Extra-Strength Headache Powders (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Pain/Fever	The worst packaging ever !!!!! Change back please ,	2	August 16, 2019	17
Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Goody's Extra-Strength Headache Powders (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Pain/Fever	Packaging sucks! It sticks to the sides so you have to use more ( maybe that's the catch). It also gets wet from the sides of your mouth and clumps up. I have used this product for 20 years but this will be my last box.	2	August 14, 2019	15
Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Goody's Extra-Strength Headache Powders (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Pain/Fever	"SOOOO nice to see that EVERYone is in agreement on this! I've actually been driving around, snatching up all of the old packaging Goody's I can find. I just ran out a few days ago, and had to resort to buying the new crappy packaging. I actually held on to one of the old-style waxed envelopes, and I'll pour the contents from the new packaging into the OLD-style wax envelope, and THEN take the powder!  I will now officially add MY voice to ""the choir"".... BRING BACK THE ORIGINAL PACKAGING!  PLEASE!!!!!"	10	August 14, 2019	19
Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Goody's Extra-Strength Headache Powders (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Migraine	Not only did they reduce the amount in the packs but lots of the powered gets stuck in the corners of the packs and I can’t get it out.  Been waiting impatiently for the old packs to return. Maybe they will but until then I’ll be using Excedrin Migraine. Works almost as well for me just not as fast as the old Goody’s. Y’all screwed this one up!	1	August 11, 2019	7
Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Goody's Extra-Strength Headache Powders (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Pain/Fever	Your new packaging SUCKS bring the old ones back		August 10, 2019	17

I hate this package.	1	August 9, 2019	12
Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Goody's Extra-Strength Headache Powders (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Pain/Fever	"I HATE the new packaging! The texture of the powder is like finely ground glass. There is less powder in each packet; I have to take two. It takes too long to get the powder out of the packet; it doesn't slide out easily and it gets stuck on the side. By the time I get I finally get some of it out; I am in worse shape because of the struggle. This is my last time purchasing a ""headache"" for a headache!"		August 8, 2019	12
Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Goody's Extra-Strength Headache Powders (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine)	Zero convenience to use. Worst Product of the year for use. Your best packaging is the orange, though it is hard to tear open	1	August 8, 2019	3
Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Goody's Extra-Strength Headache Powders (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Migraine	"Obvious corporate strategy to lower the amount of powder and increase the price for new ""on the go"" packaging.  For you idiots that changed a great product and are losing countless loyal customers... you need ""to go.""  PS.  Nice feature on your website for contacting you.  I never see a reply.  ""Go figure"""	1	August 4, 2019	6
Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Excedrin Migraine (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Pain/Fever	I was actually recommended this brand for a really bad toothache, since ibuprofen and other aspirins seemed to have no affect on me. I had instant relief within only 15 minutes and I could no longer feel the throbbing pain from the infected tooth.	10	August 3, 2019	5
Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Goody's Extra-Strength Headache Powders (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Migraine	Some changes are good, but this one is not good. Using this new package product is Definitely Not Senior Friendly  Recommend others not to support this product		July 29, 2019	7
Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Goody's Extra-Strength Headache Powders (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Pain/Fever	The new packaging is the worst and the product has changed and is very very grainy almost like crushed up glass.  It probably scratches my organs on the way down my throat.  To the makers of goodys, you screwed up!	2	July 25, 2019	13
Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Goody's Extra-Strength Headache Powders (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Pain/Fever	Your new packaging is HORRIBLE. Are you trying to run off customers? Cause you have lost this one. I would buy a two pack with my coffee everyday. Not anymore!	8	July 21, 2019	14
Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Goody's Extra-Strength Headache Powders (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Pain/Fever	Wait...I get it!..Goody’s are changing TO an ineffective, aggravating, irritating, less effective product that long time customers praise, in exchange for what some millennial jackass in advertising thinks is a good idea. Brilliant! After using Goody’s for five decades (they were 22 cents when I found them) I can only hope that this is a way they have devised to see how many users they actually have. Good work!   Not! Say, ...an ad with the plethora of pissed off long-time customers storming the gates of Goody’s factory because their headache is killing them -  may bring sales back up to pre-stupidity levels. If we wanted placebo headache relief, we would have been buying something else.	10	July 21, 2019	14
Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Excedrin Migraine (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Migraine	I've been suffering from debilitating migraines for 5 years. I see auras first, to the point I can't even see out of one or both of my eyes. Once the flashing lights go away the pain comes and it's so excruciating I vomit. I've tried aspirin, ibuprofen, and Goodys powders... finally today I almost wrecked while driving when I couldn't see because a migraine was coming on. I pulled into the CVS and asked the pharmacist what I should take. It was the last resort before going to the ER. He said Excedrin.  I'm now back at home typing this review!!!!! I can't believe it. All I'm experiencing is pressure, but no pain. I can live with migraines. I don't have to be down for 4 hours when I have kids to take care of. Thank you so much Excedrin!!!!!	10	July 18, 2019	10

Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Goody's Extra-Strength Headache Powders (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine)	This new packaging doesn't help at all!

Did they even run tests with individuals to see if it was ""easier"" to take as they claim?  Because it is most definitely not!  Goody's read these posts!

Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Goody's Extra-Strength Headache Powders (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Pain/Fever	I hate the new Goody package. I thought I was the only one that noticed that they don't taste the same. My neighbor take them as well so I gave them to him. He sent them back  and said he didn't like them. I have found the 6pack and 2pack at the Kroger in Mississippi. PLEASE BRING BACK THE ORIGINAL PACKAGE.	10	June 15, 2019	8
Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Goody's Extra-Strength Headache Powders (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Pain/Fever	I am so happy to see that I am not the only one who hates the new packaging. Not only is it a pain to get the powder out it's not the same amount of powder in the new packaging as the old. I compared the contents of  both and we are being duped. If I find the old packages at the gas stations I buy every pack that's available. Very unhappy longtime customer!	1	June 14, 2019	8
Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Goody's Extra-Strength Headache Powders (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Pain/Fever	I hate the new packaging and they don't work as well as they use to and cost more then ever. I've taken Goody powders for probably close to 30 years and they have always worked great. I get better results now if I take BC powder and take a Tylenol with them. WHY CHANGE SOMETHING THAT WORKED SO WELL.	1	June 13, 2019	6
Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Goody's Extra-Strength Headache Powders (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Migraine	I have been a huge fan of Goody's for at least 15 years I absolutely HATE the new packaging Not as much in the packs and can't even get out was is in the packs I am changing to a different product until you bring back the original packaging I took them EVERY day and was never without them on hand ..

Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Goody's Extra Strength (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Pain/Fever	I see that I'm not the only one who see the new packaging as extremely inconvenient to take. I understand that companies are always looking for ways to cut cost, but with this packaging, you're loosing valued customers. And I also agree with one of the other writer, there is less product - can't be for certain but that little thin pack can not hold the same amount as the old package	3	June 10, 2019	0
Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Goody's Extra-Strength Headache Powders (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Pain/Fever	I agree with everyone else.  Won't buy them anymore til they change them back. They don't work for headaches anymore.	1	June 7, 2019	12
Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Goody's Extra-Strength Headache Powders (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Migraine	It’s really unbelievable to me that a company can really destroy their unique and proven product/packaging concept like they did with changing the Goody powder packaging.  They must not have done any solid market research!  This must be going down in history as one of the worst marketing decision ever!  There is really nothing good about the new packaging, the old style was unique, worked wonderful and had a solid and steady following of loyal customers (including myself)  I’m really curious if there will be an apology of the manufacturer and if and when they will bring back the “old” style packaging?

Acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine	Goody's Extra-Strength Headache Powders (acetaminophen / aspirin / caffeine) for Pain/Fever	I have used Goody's for more than 20yrs. The new packaging sucks.

Acetaminophen, butalbital, and caffeine	Fioricet (acetaminophen / butalbital / caffeine)	I love this medicine! Ive been struggling with terrible brain fog. Bad constant pressure in my head. I've had a CT scan and it came back normal. I've been back and forth to my primary doc and no luck with medicines. Finally after a trip to the ER one terrible night the doc prescribed me fioricet. I've been taking it since and it blew my mind how effective it is at taking away my fog and pressure. I suffer with bad anger and tension headaches. This drug has been a God send for my issues and I've been happy and calm at work and my head's never felt better!	10	April 3, 2021	5

Acetaminophen, butalbital, and caffeine		I've suffered headaches for many years due to other medications I have to take, I've been using this acetaminophen & butalbital & caffeine combo medication for about 10 years now, before that I was taking way too many over the counter headache pills. My sister one day gave me two of the fioricet and they worked without any side effects, anything stronger would eat at my stomach or I would get nauseous, I talked with my doctor and have been using ever since. The fioricet has only three ingredients and I love that and has always, even after many years still works without any side effects. Thank You to the makers of this particular drug.	9	February 18, 2021	1

Acetaminophen, butalbital, and caffeine		I have had headaches related to a neck injury/ surgery for over 26 years.Like others I have been on all types of pain meds including narcotics, anti inflammatories , seizure meds and benzos. I was prescribed Fiorcet many years ago now the generic form. I find that it really helps decrease the headache pain enough so as I can function . My headache usually originates back of my head than eventually feels like my head is throbbing . The usual lights and sounds bother me.  At least when I use this medication I get fair relief and avoid any narcotics	9	January 13, 2021	3
Acetaminophen, butalbital, and caffeine	Fioricet (acetaminophen / butalbital / caffeine)	Headaches (HA) that lasted days. I was missing work and felt distant from my friends and family. Went to multiple doctors was put on Zanaflex, Sumatriptan, Zofran, and Topamax. None of them worked so I continued to take ibuprofen nearly every day and ended up with a stomach ulcer. Still had horrible HAs at least once a week and felt none of my doctors were listening to me, so I got a new doctor. First visit he prescribed me Fioricet and was shocked nobody did before. It has improved my life so much. It is the first thing that I have used that actually works every time. Some people say it makes them really groggy but I don't feel that at all. I have been prescribed opioids and benzos in the past for unrelated issues and this drug isn't even close to either of those. I take it at work and makes me feel relaxed but I can still function, even better than not taking it. I feel happy again instead of dreading life because my head and neck are really bothering me.	9	December 24, 2020	13
Acetaminophen, butalbital, and caffeine	Fioricet (acetaminophen / butalbital / caffeine)	To Ann regarding spice headache, they are called thunderclap headaches which means you may have a condition called rcvs. I only suffer from tension headaches and menstrual cramps and menstruation headaches. When I don’t have fioricet during my period, I find orange juice replenished my blood cell count thus dimming the migraines significantly. This medicine helped me for both.	9	December 24, 2020	5
Acetaminophen, butalbital, and caffeine		In a very stressful new job all of a sudden I started experiencing violent migraine headaches - losing vision, can't even drive home! Prescribed Fioricet and WOW headaches gone.  No more suffering.  I returned to normal life!  That was 29 years ago.  I keep some tablets with me all the time and do take it every day.  Rebound headaches do happen but Advil helps.  This med is a miracle.	10	December 12, 2020	2
Acetaminophen, butalbital, and caffeine	Esgic (acetaminophen / butalbital / caffeine)	My experience with Esgic WOW I had a Migraine in the hospital the Doctor that was seeing me gave me Esgic and Bam my Migraine was gone and even till this day it's been since June of 2020 still take them today. My headache was so bad till my forehead would turn red.Thanks for Esgic....	10	November 18, 2020	3
Acetaminophen, butalbital, and caffeine		I've been taking Fioricet for several years now. I don't take them as often as I used to as my migraines have improved but it's nice to know I have this med to rely on. I also take Rizatriptan at the first sign of a headache which works very well.  Hot black coffee and a fioricet helps a lot. I have had people mention that fioricet makes them sleepy but I don't have that problem. My nurse practitioner prescribes these and she knows I don't and wouldn't abuse them.	10	September 15, 2020	2
Acetaminophen, butalbital, and caffeine	Esgic (acetaminophen / butalbital / caffeine)	Great for my headaches	9	June 10, 2020	2
Acetaminophen, butalbital, and caffeine		I was just prescribed Butal-acet-caff. As most of you know, nothing relives migraine headaches. I tried it the first time yesterday and didn’t get relief until 2-3 hours later. I don’t know if it was from the medication or it just went away. My migraines always start in the morning and I didn’t get the medication until the afternoon. I’m hoping this will work faster the next time and I can take them at the very start.	6	April 2, 2020	4
Acetaminophen, butalbital, and caffeine		I have had bad stress headaches for as long as I can remember they started around age 11 I’m going to be turning 50 in September.  This is  the only medicine that works a 100% . my family Dr. put me on them at age 15 so for 35 years I would have probably put myself down if I hadn’t started these. The headaches hurt so bad that I was like I just couldn't go on. I'm so thankful for this medicine.	10	January 15, 2020	16
Acetaminophen, butalbital, and caffeine	Fioricet (acetaminophen / butalbital / caffeine)	It's about a 3 hour span of no effect when taking 1 every 8 hours so not to helpful. Going back to doctor cause the condition is still the same.	2	January 3, 2020	6
Acetaminophen, butalbital, and caffeine	Fioricet (acetaminophen / butalbital / caffeine)	I've had migraines for 40 years and tried everything and the one drug that keeps them at bay is fiorecet . I have to take 3x a day to keep them away. With the new drug rules that you can't get your pain meds until the exact day sucks. Several times when I should be able to get them Walgreens then doesn't stock them so I end up with a bad migraine for 3 days that imitrex barely helps. I too after taking for over 10 years now prefer the codeine version. Neck full of arthritis.	10	December 14, 2019	33
Acetaminophen, butalbital, and caffeine		I have had cluster/tension headaches since my 20’s (I’m now 57). Started with Midrin then it went off market. Imitrex didn’t help & I tried Fioricet. My headaches will start in my right eye, then wrap around my head like a vice and if I don’t take Fioricet within an hour or two, these headaches will last for 2-3 weeks. Then in July of this year, my family dr wanted me to go to a NEUROLIGIST & wouldn’t prescribe it anymore.  His office said it was now classified as a narcotic (I’m in FL). So, I’ve taken hoards of Excedrine & ended up with a bleeding ulcer. The nurse at my dr’s office begged me to stop the Excedrine.  I told her I can’t get in to my NEUROLIGIST until mid JAN of 2020. I was in tears today. I told her I had taken 6 Excedrine since I woke up. They asked me to do a CT Scan the next day at the hospital but today - he called in 90 Fioricet w/3 refills. I guess they finally believed me.	10	December 5, 2019	20
Acetaminophen, butalbital, and caffeine	Fioricet (acetaminophen / butalbital / caffeine)	I have suffered from headaches and migraines most of my life. I use to take Excedrin Migraine like candy until my doctor prescribed Fioricet. Works like a charm everytime. Miracle drug in my opinion. I'm 62.	10	December 3, 2019	50
Acetaminophen, butalbital, and caffeine		I noticed that the best time to take the drug (1 pill) is at 4am, when I have to go to the bathroom at night.  If I feel that I might be getting a migraine in the morning, I take the pill and go back to sleep.  I wake up with no migraine and the migraine is gone for the rest of the day.  If I hadn’t taken the pill (at/or around 4 am), a migraine will develop in the morning, and I will not be able to get rid of it, even if I take a pill at 7 or 8 am.  Strange.., but I have tested this process a number of times.		October 25, 2019	24
Acetaminophen, butalbital, and caffeine	Fioricet (acetaminophen / butalbital / caffeine)	First this med Fioricet is not addictive. I take it as needed.  Originally prescribed years ago for Tension & Sinus headaches.  Four years ago had surgery (upper extremity) & have suffered from chronic pain upper back & shoulder muscles as well as upper cervical causing headaches.  I take 1/2 tablet every 4 to 6 hrs & allows me to function. Doesn’t ever relieve all the pain Is adequate alternative to dangerous narcotics.  NOT ADDICTIVE.  Fioricet makes life bearable with no side effects.	10	October 9, 2019	49
Acetaminophen, butalbital, and caffeine	Fioricet (acetaminophen / butalbital / caffeine)	I have been in severe chronic pain for 40 years. I suffered from trigeminal neuralgia for twenty years. I had two blood vessels pressing on the trigeminal nerve which feels as though I was  bring stabbed with a red hot poker in my right eye. Plus right side of face would pull down with cluster and migraines. For years fioricet was the only med that relieved the nerve pain. I used other pain meds for other pain relief. Ultimately I had to have brain surgery it has a big name but Teflon pads between blood vessels and trigeminal nerve. It worked for 20 years. I now have fifth nerve -glossopharyngeal nerve which runs. Along right side of tongue. An electric shock lasting a split second or longer from one time a  day  or for 30 minutes. Once a day to every hour. Nerves stays inflamed-like it is scalded. Can’t brush teeth, eat anything spicy, hot, etc. without extreme nerve Pain. The only med. that relieves some of pain is fioricet. Taking two 50-325+ caff.	10	October 8, 2019	32
Acetaminophen, butalbital, and caffeine		I had severe migraines and tension headaches for years and tried various medicines. As soon as I would find one then they took it off the market… So a friend had me try this one and it worked! And it was easier to get. My doctor prescribed them for me and it’s a pain because my insurance won’t dispense them through my mail order  on a regular basis, but I can get them filled by calling the doctors office and picking them up at the local pharmacist. Definitely get the pill not the capsule! So insurance will pay for most of it. The medicine itself works so well to relieve my symptoms of nausea and pain relief with just a mild sedative feeling of relaxation so I can still work. I am so grateful for this medicine	10	September 24, 2019	11
Acetaminophen, butalbital, and caffeine	Fioricet (acetaminophen / butalbital / caffeine)	FIORICET is the ONLY  RX to lessen or stop my daily migraines of 15 years. Like many others, I have tried many things, always under the care of my neurologist and primary care, and pain management doctor.  I never  used more than prescribed.  I would prefer not using it, due to the stigma of using a narcotic.  Medicare Part D doesn't cover it.  Only another migraine suffer knows.	1	August 23, 2019	45
Acetaminophen, butalbital, and caffeine	Fioricet (acetaminophen / butalbital / caffeine)	"I've had migraines for about 30+ years.  After many tests and trials by a neurologist, she put me on a ""triple therapy"" treatment consisting of 25 mg Indomethacin capsule, 50 mg Fioricet, & an anti-nausea med.  I stopped taking the anti-nausea meds because I never get nauseous with my migraines but the other 2 are the ONLY meds that have ever totally gotten rid of my migraines.  So my testament is from using these 2 for over 30 years.  At the first sign of a migraine or waking up with one, I usually  take 1 indomethacin and 1/2 tablet Fioricet and I'm good for the rest of the day!  Thumbs Up!!"	10	August 17, 2019	33
Acetaminophen, butalbital, and caffeine	Fioricet (acetaminophen / butalbital / caffeine)	"I had my 1st migraine/tension headache about 10yrs ago. I was on Midrin,(which is THE BEST med IMO) before it went off market. Next:Imitrex,it was ok until I developed Serotonin Syndrome, so I’m banned from Triptans & Ergo’s. Then the""replacement""for Midrin had come out ,but IT went off the market too! So now Fioricet! I was on 1cap: 2X’s/day PRN w/no relief & also no SE’s. Now I take 2caps PRN & it’s close to how Midrin worked, so I’m happy with it!"	9	June 29, 2019	26
Acetaminophen, butalbital, and caffeine	Fioricet (acetaminophen / butalbital / caffeine)	I have had a headaches of some sort since 1992. Migraine, tension and cluster among others I can't describe. This is the only med that comes close to giving me relief! It's not intended for migraines but, it seems to take the sharp edge off of it! Thank goodness I haven't had any bad side effects from it. Now and then I will have a rebound h/a but nothing bad!	10	June 17, 2019	34
Acetaminophen, butalbital, and caffeine		Only med that helps with my pain from migraines and cervical spondylosis . One or two a day can keep things at bay. When I have a bad day 3-4 and sleep does the trick. I have tried every migraine med out there. Cannot take narcotic pain meds (they never help with migraines anyway)   Always go back to this oldie, and in my case, goodie.	10	June 16, 2019	8
Acetaminophen, butalbital, and caffeine	Fioricet (acetaminophen / butalbital / caffeine)	Such a great headache medication!  I do prefer the Codeine version	10	June 6, 2019	16
Acetaminophen, butalbital, and caffeine		Migraine sufferer since my childhood. I get them a few times a month. Doctor prescribed this for me. I have tried the medication five times now (five different occassions) over the course of this year. Absolutely no effect. No change in head pain, and no other noticeable effects whatsoever. I'm super sensitive to any medication (even normal tylenol). So this strikes me as very odd. Wondering if my medication is just a placebo or got accidentally switched or mismarked. Anyway, I will be going back to the doctor to ask for something different.	1	March 9, 2019	5
Acetaminophen, butalbital, and caffeine	Fioricet (acetaminophen / butalbital / caffeine)	I began getting migraines about a year after my first child .. It is legit hands down the best drug I've taken for migraine. I stopped drinking in 2011 fully expecting to be healthy. That didn't even happen a little bit. I've devoted diabetes, and when my bs crashes, I instantly get a migraine. Fioricet works better than any drug that I've tried. The only thing that I don't like is sometimes I do get a rebound headache or the hangover feeling.	9	February 28, 2019	18
Acetaminophen, butalbital, and caffeine		I was nervous to take this medicine because of some of the reviews. but WOW! it sure works!! I had a tension headache due to being 17 weeks pregnant and this is the only thing the Doctor could prescribe me as Tylenol was not working. I took this medicine at home first to make sure it didn't make me tired. When I got home it kicked in within 15 minutes, and it did not make me tired! I highly recommend this for severe headaches!	10	February 26, 2019	11
Acetaminophen, butalbital, and caffeine		"When I was 19, The doctor initially put me on Fioricet which was GREAT.  Most insurance refused to cover Fioricet, so, they prescribed the Generic , BUPAP 5-325-40.  They have always worked very well on my migraines.  I've taken these pills for 30 years and they work well, however, lately, CVS filled my RX and , I've had a few pills (out of the 90 pill bottle) that threw me for a loop.  Not sure WTH happened, but, something was definitely ""off"" with them. Looked the same but the side effects were WEIRD and SCARY.  Last night, I took one pill-when I laid down, I felt like I couldn't breathe right and got chills, shaky, leg pain/heaviness, lightheaded and had to walk around for hours because I was afraid to lie down.   This only USED to happen when they gave me the CAPSULES with Codeine --which I stopped taking.  Not sure if anyone else has had a ""ringer"" in their bottle??  I want to get a new RX but I don't know if it will happen again."		February 8, 2019	5
Acetaminophen, butalbital, and caffeine		This medication has always worked for me when I get migraines.	10	February 3, 2019	3
Acetaminophen, butalbital, and caffeine		This did not work for me. I used to take Midrin but they took it off the market - so I got this  instead. This didn't  help me  	1	January 30, 2019	7
Acetaminophen, butalbital, and caffeine	Fioricet (acetaminophen / butalbital / caffeine)	Fiorcet works to eliminate most of my migraine symptoms; ie: tight, tense neck, shoulders, upper back and facial muscles, throbbing, radiating and stabbing pains and nausea.  It greatly reduces and sometimes eliminates changes in tastes and smells, sound and light sensitivities.	10	January 30, 2019	32
Acetaminophen, butalbital, and caffeine	Fioricet (acetaminophen / butalbital / caffeine)	I noticed a few people mentioned that their insurance didn't cover it. I experienced the same problem. Insurance didn't cover my script. Then one day a pharmacist tried to run it as a pill instead of the capsule and like magic insurance covered the script. Fioricet works wonders for my migraines and tension headaches. Unfortunately,  I go to a local clinic where doctor turnover is high so I have to jump through hoops and have my meds screwed with about every six months. They always end up prescribing me fioricet but, not until they try a litany of trial and error on my headaches. I've have clusters, migraines and tension headaches since 1971. I used to take darvocet 100's and they quit making those. Then midrin and they stopped that. Now fioricet and they're kind of weird about that.  Just remember to try the pill and not capsule tablets and set if your insurance is more user friendly.	9	December 4, 2018	36
Acetaminophen, butalbital, and caffeine	Fioricet (acetaminophen / butalbital / caffeine)	I have had migraine headaches for over 30 yrs.  I have taken MANY meds that were prescribed by Neurologists that created a lot of side affects- none that were helpful.  I now take 2 Fiorocet pills everyday and find it manages my chronic daily headaches most days.  I know it is believed that my headaches may be rebound headaches but all the many attempts to address this have failed.  My use has not escalated, and I am able to work at a demanding job and be present for my family.  I am very grateful for Fiorocet!	9	September 3, 2018	67
Acetaminophen, butalbital, and caffeine	Fioricet (acetaminophen / butalbital / caffeine)	Do not let the big drug company sponsored research scare you out of trying this medication for your tension HA.  I have tried several medications in the past.  All with promises of being the miracle drug for me.  Fioricet is the only medication that allowed me to be truly free of my HA.  I was unable to work and collected unemployment.  Fioricet allowed me to work and be free from government over site.  Thank you to all the companies out there that don't let the old line drugs fall away from doctors site.	10	August 28, 2018	48
Acetaminophen, butalbital, and caffeine	Fioricet (acetaminophen / butalbital / caffeine)	This literally took away a tension headache I had for 3 days within 20 minutes. I couldn’t believe how fast it worked. Nothing else has helped me in the past.	8	August 21, 2018	40
Acetaminophen, butalbital, and caffeine	Fioricet (acetaminophen / butalbital / caffeine)	I have had a headache non stop for 8 months now. Fioracet is the only thing saving me. It stops the pain (till it wears off) with no side effects.  I hate taking meds. But this one I have to give a 10 stars!	10	July 13, 2018	41
Acetaminophen, butalbital, and caffeine		Generic does not work as well as Fiorocet	5	June 22, 2018	10
Acetaminophen, butalbital, and caffeine	Fioricet (acetaminophen / butalbital / caffeine)	The only thing that works for severe headaches on the back and top of head.	10	June 15, 2018	33
Acetaminophen, butalbital, and caffeine	Fioricet (acetaminophen / butalbital / caffeine)	Only thing that works 90% of the time with no side effects. Now the VA will not dispense it even with my Neurologists prescriptions.	10	May 28, 2018	27
Acetaminophen, butalbital, and caffeine	Fioricet (acetaminophen / butalbital / caffeine)	So thankful for Flioricet as I have had migraines/tension headaches for ten years daily. I can tell they are coming on and take 2 tabs within 15 minutes have relief without side effects. A specialist tried 2 other pills that mad me dizzy for 2 days as required before he would do Botox. He also tried amitripline along with the firocet which gave me relief plus great sleep..maybe too much. I have been charged up to nearly $1000/ year for 2 each 12 hours as needed... basically daily. I have demanded and gotten a $243 price, / 120 days, self pay, as my insurance does not have it in the formulary. Why is it so costly?....	10	May 18, 2018	20
Acetaminophen, butalbital, and caffeine		For me, it works very well for migraines. I read below where it caused someone else a seizure. First time I've ever heard that before. Perhaps they had a rare allergic reaction or mixed it with something else that was not compatible.  This drug had been around a long time. It works very well for me. I used to get migraines before my periods, and it worked great. I would take 1 or 2 pills as needed. Later on, after I was post menopausal and went on bio identical hormones (all natural and custom to what my body needs) and between treatments (lasts 3 to 4 months) I might get migraines before I am due for more hormone pellets, and I take the generic for Fioricet, and it works great. Never had any problems. I know of other people who have used it without any issues. So it works well for stress headaches or hormone headaches.	9	May 1, 2018	9
Acetaminophen, butalbital, and caffeine		Nothing else works as well.  The problem is the price keeps going up even for the 325 tablets.  This drug has been around since the 80's at least.  So no reason to charge so much - no new research nor change of ingredients has been done on this one  Several years ago they reduced the amount of acetaminophen to 300.  But it costs more.   They reduce the amount of active ingredient and charge more.   Explain that !!!!	10	April 28, 2018	9
Acetaminophen, butalbital, and caffeine		Has been the most helpful medicine I have ever taken for migraines. I take topamax regularly to prevent them and if it gets really bad the fioricet is so great to have. One drawback is my dr doesn’t like prescribing it due to the barbiturate in it, so I try to get by with ibuprofen as often as possible.	10	March 13, 2018	5
Acetaminophen, butalbital, and caffeine		I've tried a few things for excruciating headaches (topamax, relpax, imitrex), and this. Honestly, it didn't really help with the headache. Still had a throbbing that lasted all day, dulled it a little but I would recommend relpax.		February 9, 2018	1
Acetaminophen, butalbital, and caffeine		Best headache medicine ever, works in 15 minutes or less!	10	December 23, 2017	10
Acetaminophen, butalbital, and caffeine	Fioricet (acetaminophen / butalbital / caffeine)	Had a seizure for an entire day after not taking this. The situation was a headache, but migraine level, so maybe a migraine. Lights were overpowering, sound was too loud, I couldn’t focus on simply existing. So a hospitalist prescribed me this. After, I had the first seizure of my life, it lasted about half a day. My mother luckily was around the house, and noticed something was off, but it was hours into seizing that she realized what was happening. I awoke in the hospital restarained to the bed and no idea how I got there.  If you take multiple medicines, stay away from Fioricet.  Now at every hospital visit, I’m put safely with towels around the bed, and have no freedom to even walk. All because of this one experience.  Beware of Fioric		December 7, 2017	6
Acetaminophen, butalbital, and caffeine	Fioricet (acetaminophen / butalbital / caffeine)	Effective for migraine and tension headaches, can cause slurring of speech and over anxiety especially on maximum dose.	9	October 11, 2017	5
Acetaminophen, butalbital, and caffeine	Fioricet (acetaminophen / butalbital / caffeine)	Was given foricet at E.R. for Tension headache and I suffer from severe anxiety I immediately had tachycardia (fast heart beat) after taking this drug it got rid of my headache but it left me miserable with my anxiety never taking this again	1	October 10, 2017	13
Acetaminophen, butalbital, and caffeine	Fioricet (acetaminophen / butalbital / caffeine)	I started getting severe headaches 3 months after starting a new job I loved; I was only getting between 4-6 hrs of sleep a night after being on my feet 16 hrs a day.  Artificial lights were like swords in my brain during the day, and towards the evening were intolerable.  Noise was also making my head hurt worse - to the point where I was throwing up from the pain.  I was given Topamax and had great results for a week.  Then tapered to better results than not taking it. I was still getting the headaches daily.  My doctor prescribed Fioricet PRN along with Propanalol to take with the Topamax as a preventative measure.  What a relief.  What a difference.  I had a Doctor of Osteopathy who immediately knew what to prescribe via my symptoms.	9	October 5, 2017	22
Acetaminophen, butalbital, and caffeine	Fioricet (acetaminophen / butalbital / caffeine)	I have had a pounding throbbing migraine for 18 days a terrible throbbing pain on the left side of my head. I tried everything under the sun imitrex over the counter everything the only thing that worked for me is fioricet it took away my migraine in an instant I suffer from anxiety so that caused my tension migraines this medicine puts anxiety at easy and your migraine completely gone. Please don't be in pain anymore go to your doctor and get fioricet. I feel for all the migraine sufferers I have been dealing with it for half my life don't be in pain anymore this medicine will really work also if you have moderate to severe anxiety like I do hope this helps!!!	10	September 9, 2017	40
Acetaminophen, butalbital, and caffeine		Not sure of effectiveness for pain		August 27, 2017	0
Acetaminophen, butalbital, and caffeine	Fioricet (acetaminophen / butalbital / caffeine)	It helps to knock out the pain and reduce the tension in the head and eyes associated with migraine, but it appears to be somewhat of a controlled substance, or at least one that they're wary of, so I'm not sure what else I can do to be migraine free. I've tried Botox twice. I now know that does not work for me. I tried Effexor as a prophylactic. Not working. This is hormone related so there's not a heck of a lot I can do here - but just keep asking for more pills. Not ideal, but worn out. My eyeball hurts right now just looking at this screen.	8	August 3, 2017	22
Acetaminophen, butalbital, and caffeine	Fioricet (acetaminophen / butalbital / caffeine)	Why is Firocet so expensive?. I am retired and my plan has this drug cost at $500.		July 17, 2017	18
Acetaminophen, butalbital, and caffeine	Fioricet (acetaminophen / butalbital / caffeine)	This is the best medicine for tension headaches bar none.  Big pharma has tried to get it banned for years because it is so cheap and effective which is a treat to their vastly over priced, dangerous and ineffective alternatives..  IF YOU HAVE HEADACHE OF ANY KIND, I STRONGLY URGE YOU TO TRY THIS MIRACLE (FOR ME) MEDICATION.	10	June 10, 2017	39
Acetaminophen, butalbital, and caffeine	Fioricet (acetaminophen / butalbital / caffeine)	Like all the meds for pain, sleep, back in the day; the 60s to the turn of the 21st century, these drugs actually work.  I thought fiorinal had gone the way of Seconal, Nembutal, Amytal, Tuinal, Doriden, and the scores of other equally effective compounds, but a doctor recently gave me a script for Fioricet, shocked it was still around, and that it was not a controlled substance here in Tucson; but best of all, it works.  I've always sworn by these pills; they live up to their claim of effectiveness on tension, and not just headaches; they handle stress, anxiety, panic disorders, and the entire spectrum of nervous disorders.  New is not better,  it's just a poor smudged carbon copy of the original, and a very bad one at that.		June 6, 2017	39
Acetaminophen, butalbital, and caffeine	Fioricet (acetaminophen / butalbital / caffeine)	I've been having migraines since I was a little girl. I've been on all sorts of migraine meds over the years.  Imitrex, triptan, neurotoxin,  and even Xanax because they thought it is being caused by anxiety.   About 2 years ago I was in my classroom and had a wicked migraine.  A sub told me about fioricet. I asked my doctor,  mind you I was being seen by my doctor for this problem. When I arrived at the doctors that day.  I couldn't even open my eyes. She prescribed it to me before I went over for another CT scan of my head.  It worked so fast and I got relief before I left from my CT scan. It was a miracle.  Nothing worked liked fioricet. But I've had other types of migraines,  other then ones coming from my neck, it didn't work the same.	10	May 19, 2017	30
Acetaminophen, butalbital, and caffeine	Fioricet (acetaminophen / butalbital / caffeine)	I take this almost every 2-5 days, due to my unbearable tension headaches. This past time (I am Rx'd 2 tabs every 4-6 hrs) I took my entire daily taking which is what, max 12? and I took them all but staggered, and I ended up in the ER with a shot of Naloxone from overdosing on the butalbital. Not sure naloxone works on barbs....but they gave it to me anyway. I was so out of it I couldn't see or talk right. I'm someone who takes benzos..or used to, that is, so I can handle that type of feeling. BUT....at the end of the day, this medication DOES work for tension headaches and helps me sleep, the caffeine in my opinion is cancelled out by the butalbital. I take the non scheduled- no codeine- version- although I wish I was. id cut back on em.	9	May 11, 2017	7
Acetaminophen, butalbital, and caffeine	Fioricet (acetaminophen / butalbital / caffeine)	"I like this medicine for tension headaches.  It works fast. The bad side is, it makes me jittery and on edge. It must be the low dose of caffeine.  I really don't know.  But I take it as a last resort.  I don't get sleepy or tired. Just a little ""out of it""    I know the caffeine is there to help, just wish it was lower. I also take ativan. Not at the same time, a few hours later.  It gets rid of the fioricet jitters.  Hate to have to take them both in the same day.  I have to much to do, to put my brain in a fog, and my nerves on high alert. With my job I need to be focused.  Can't take on a work day.    Maybe it's time to try something else. But..this does work for tension.  So if you can be at home, good headache med to take."	9	April 26, 2017	7
Acetaminophen, butalbital, and caffeine	Fioricet (acetaminophen / butalbital / caffeine)	I was prescribed fioricet for migraines. Not only didn't it help the migraine, fioricet caused my heart rate to skyrocket (due to the amount of caffeine it contains) and gave me an absolutely WICKED rebound headache the next day. In fact, the rebound headache was worse than the original migraine. Needless to say, I threw the rest of the pills down the toilet. Fioricet is also EXTREMELY addicting if taken more than 3 times per month. Astonishingly, I was prescribed 1 to 2 tablets EVERY 8 hours for migraines with NO WARNING whatsoever from my doctor about how addicting this medication is. Thank God it didn't work for me or else I'd be a fioricet addict facing withdrawal whenever the drug isn't taken. It should be taken off the market	1	April 25, 2017	16
Acetaminophen, butalbital, and caffeine	Esgic-Plus (acetaminophen / butalbital / caffeine)	I got this prescribed by the ER after dealing with severe migraines. Took it for the first time today after trying everything else and no relief in sight, within 30 minutes my headache was gone, I did notice a slight lightheaded feeling in the beginning but it soon passed and I finished out the rest of my day at work like normal. I'm definitely a fan!	10	April 11, 2017	9
Acetaminophen, butalbital, and caffeine	Fioricet (acetaminophen / butalbital / caffeine)	I've been getting terrible migraines for almost 20 years now. I currently take Topsmax to prevent them. When I was younger, I was prescribed Fioricet for the pain and never thought it worked very well. I switched to imitrex, which worked miracles and now take Maxalt Melt, the orally disintegrating tablets, which are also a -triptan medication. It is the only type of med to get rid of my migraines. Just tried fioricet again in a pinch and didn't do anything! Tramadol does not work either.	2	April 10, 2017	14
Acetaminophen, butalbital, and caffeine	Fioricet (acetaminophen / butalbital / caffeine)	Yes...great medicine for migraines. However the barbiturate in this drug can be bad. Before I knew I was bipolar I took this medicine. It made me go mentally insane for about a week out of the month. Something in my brain did not like it.	6	March 21, 2017	12
Acetaminophen, butalbital, caffeine, and codeine		This medication has been great. I suffer from tension headaches daily and occasionally migraines. This medication helps relieve the stiff muscles in my neck so I can stretch. It’s the only thing I’ve found to work. My pharmacist is getting nervous and has been checking in with my doctor who thankfully continues to prescribe. I don’t know what I would do without it! It’s given me my life back.  With the whole opioid crisis, I pray I can continue to take it.	10	June 28, 2020	4
Acetaminophen, butalbital, caffeine, and codeine	Fioricet with Codeine (acetaminophen / butalbital / caffeine / codeine)	Great	10	January 26, 2020	5
Acetaminophen, butalbital, caffeine, and codeine		I've been taking Fioricet for over 30 years. The only thing that works. I use to take Midrin but it was outlawed. I think we need somebody in the FDA with migraines and headaches. They'll at least have an understanding. Fioricet/codeine work best but have gone back and forth without codeine depending on Dr. Just take 2 at a time w/o cod. 7 years ago my problems started with Medicare. My Dr. would write at least 2 letters because I kept calling her. # 3 days into a headache I visited the office and told my Dr. I was looking at bridges. I am happy to say, Medicare and my Dr. are on board. My concern is the new government agenda on eliminating or cutting back on the drug w/o concern for the patients. I'm 72 and not over using the product.		December 14, 2017	10
Acetaminophen, butalbital, caffeine, and codeine	Fioricet with Codeine (acetaminophen / butalbital / caffeine / codeine)	Listen.  I have suffered with migraine for 40 years.  MSG is a big trigger and so is smoke, stress, chemicals like insecticide, exhaust from a car, broken sleep, and many others.  I don’t get vision disturbance.  Just headaches.  I take Maxalt but doesn’t always work if I don’t catch it early enough.  I’ve taken Fiorcet with and without codeine.  Both relieve the pain but it takes 4 non codeine pills to do the same job as one or two with  codeine.  Because of all of the overdosed and news about our epidemic/crisis doctors don’t want to write them any more.  I get the addictive nature of the drugs but they do work well when they are used sparingly.  I just want the pain to stop.  Fiorcet works.	10	September 25, 2017	20
Acetaminophen, butalbital, caffeine, and codeine		This is a great med for migraines!! I don't know why insurance stopped covering it, but it's absolutely ridiculous especially when you finally find something that helps when you have 24/7 pain!! I would suggest it to anyone that has severe migraine pain.  It is FAR superior to the one without codeine. Taking the regular one is just like taking an OTC med. A waste of time and money. I've heard it can cause rebound headaches, but I've never had that problem with this med or any other.	9	August 1, 2017	8
Acetaminophen, butalbital, caffeine, and codeine	Fioricet with Codeine (acetaminophen / butalbital / caffeine / codeine)	My insurance wouldn't cover this medication but it's not very expensive,... And it works wonders. Worth it for sure!	10	June 24, 2017	14
Acetaminophen, butalbital, caffeine, and codeine	Fioricet with Codeine (acetaminophen / butalbital / caffeine / codeine)	It works very well...for 3 hrs., which is too bad. Please take as directed. If not, you'll run out early. Believe me, you'll be sorry when you're in pain and realize you've run out. It's very tempting to take more when you're in pain, but DO NOT DO IT!	7	April 25, 2017	13
Acetaminophen, caffeine, and dihydrocodeine	Trezix (acetaminophen / caffeine / dihydrocodeine)	This Trezix is the best pain RX I've ever gotten from my pain management doctor. So happy to have gotten it. Never had any side effects from it. Don't get me wrong I still have some pain but it dramatically reduces the pain whenever I use it.	10	January 8, 2021	2
Acetaminophen, caffeine, and dihydrocodeine	Trezix (acetaminophen / caffeine / dihydrocodeine)	"This stuff is pretty much useless for *serious* pain - like back degeneration that makes it almost impossible to walk because of crippling leg pain. This medication is like taking a regular strength Tylenol. And then there's the fact that the manufacturer has the stones to take a med that's been generic for decades, add some acetaminophen and caffeine, and charge Brand name prices for the ""novel"" combo. Criminal. With the craziness surrounding opioids these days (I get it, but...), expect more and more ""Pain Management"" clinics to push people onto this ineffective rubbish."	1	January 11, 2020	6
Acetaminophen, caffeine, and dihydrocodeine	Trezix (acetaminophen / caffeine / dihydrocodeine)	This medication gave my life back. I was injured overseas and suffer from chronic hip pain and need a partial replacement. Trezix does not mask the pain totally, but takes the pain level down allowing me to function. Norco, and dilaudid are better pain relievers, but you are taken into a faded state of consciousness. <3 Trezix	8	August 27, 2019	3
Acetaminophen, caffeine, and dihydrocodeine	Trezix (acetaminophen / caffeine / dihydrocodeine)	Made me feel like I was choking. No pain relief at all.	1	January 28, 2019	1
Acetaminophen, caffeine, and dihydrocodeine	Trezix (acetaminophen / caffeine / dihydrocodeine)	I started this medication last night. So far, it has only made me feel worse, hasn't helped the pain in my back and shoulder, gave me horrible heartburn, and I was up most of the night from the pain.	2	March 22, 2018	4
Acetaminophen, chlorpheniramine, and dextromethorphan	Coricidin HBP Maximum Strength Flu (acetaminophen / chlorpheniramine / dextromethorphan) for Influenza	Had an annual flu shot in Oct. 2017. No problem until I did a quick road trip to New Mexico and West Texas. Stayed at quality hotels and ate out the entire trip. Got back two weeks ago and the Flu hit me 6 days ago. Its still going on and it is not nice. Coricidin Maximum Flu has helped, but symptoms have not gone away. This flu is one of those  variants that the shot did not cover. Coricidin has done a good job.	10	March 23, 2018	2
Acetaminophen, chlorpheniramine, and phenylephrine	Alka-Seltzer Plus Cold (acetaminophen / chlorpheniramine / phenylephrine) for Sinus Symptoms	It works but at a cost.

Acetaminophen, chlorpheniramine, and phenylephrine	Alka-Seltzer Plus Cold (acetaminophen / chlorpheniramine / phenylephrine) for Cold Symptoms	This stuff makes me so tired I can not get out of bed. It cleared my runny nose and headache, but at a huge cost, I am exhausted!	9	February 1, 2020	1

Acetaminophen, chlorpheniramine, and phenylephrine	Alka-Seltzer Plus Cold (acetaminophen / chlorpheniramine / phenylephrine) for Cold Symptoms	This product is very effective, but your commercials are extremely goofy.

Acetaminophen, chlorpheniramine, and phenylephrine	Alka-Seltzer Plus Cold (acetaminophen / chlorpheniramine / phenylephrine) for Cold Symptoms	This caused shortness of breath.  I was barely made it to the hospital. This should not be an over the counter medicine		December 26, 2018	1
Acetaminophen, chlorpheniramine, and phenylephrine	XL-3 Cold Medicine (acetaminophen / chlorpheniramine / phenylephrine) for Cold Symptoms	It’s been the best , fast acting cold medication. My family always bought it in Mexico . (Originated from Mexico) But if it’s from Mexico , the ingredients are more potent. Higher mgs. But the US brand works great. It’s best to take after a light meal ,cuts down on the instant “rush feeling “. For night time , I have taken 2 pills (30minutes or 1 hour apart ) knocked me out to get the much needed rest from flu/cold .  Always be cautious of medication; everyone reacts differently.	9	October 21, 2018	4
Acetaminophen, chlorpheniramine, and phenylephrine	Norel AD (acetaminophen / chlorpheniramine / phenylephrine) for Cold Symptoms	I had severe sore throat, mucus draining in the back of my throat.

Acetaminophen, chlorpheniramine, and phenylephrine	Cold Symptoms	Product works well if you can survive swallowing the pills.  Took the medication and got choked, had to have rescue procedures done one me because I couldn't breathe.  The pill would not go down.		January 8, 2018	2

Acetaminophen, dextromethorphan, doxylamine, and phenylephrine	Vicks NyQuil Severe Cold & Flu (acetaminophen / dextromethorphan / doxylamine / phenylephrine) for Cough and Nasal Congestion	I have been using Nyquil for years and been very happy until recently. It used to soothe my throat and let me sleep. Now, it is virtually useless. Does not help at all. Do not waste your money on it. After I figured out it wasn't working anymore, I looked it up and they have changed the formula. It does not help at all, and I will not only not buy ever again, I will tell everyone I know to not waste they're money on it. Couldn't be more disappointed.	1	October 3, 2020	2
Acetaminophen, dextromethorphan, doxylamine, and phenylephrine	Vicks NyQuil Severe Cold & Flu (acetaminophen / dextromethorphan / doxylamine / phenylephrine) for Cough and Nasal Congestion	This product is not as good as their previous product and does not work as well for congestion or cough relief.

Acetaminophen, dextromethorphan, doxylamine, and phenylephrine	Vicks NyQuil Severe Cold & Flu (acetaminophen / dextromethorphan / doxylamine / phenylephrine) for Cough	Well worth my $10. I did feel groggy when I did wake up. I took two 12 oz bottles within the 2 weeks of having a cough, but it seemed to put me to sleep. I think I will wait because I hear it can cause addiction (word of mouth, but I can be wrong).	10	February 1, 2018	0

Acetaminophen, pamabrom, and pyrilamine	Pamprin Multi-Symptom Menstrual Relief (acetaminophen / pamabrom / pyrilamine) for Premenstrual Dysphoric Disorder	This OTC medication does eventually alleviate the pain and severe cramping for me, but it takes about 2 hours to do so.  The pain starts coming back about an hour before I can take the next dose.  With this medication having such a high amount of acetominophen, I'm scared to take the next dose early.  I need to investigate alternatives.		July 12, 2017	3

Acetazolamide	Pseudotumor Cerebri	I have been diagnosed with IIH (Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension) they put me on diamox. I am a rarer case because I am a thin woman compared to most. They hoped the diamox will help bring down the fluid. I started on 250mg twice daily. Anything carbonated tasted dull and metallic. My ENTIRE body will tingle and go numb but at different times throughout the day multiple times. The WORST experience for me is I am peeing all the time and my face is also breaking out, and my hands are numb and tingling for HOURS throughout the day. Overall the pins/needles in my feet up to my knees are so PAINFUL. It feels like glass/knives and this is no exaggeration. I am left in tears and it happens many times a day on each leg and I wake up out of my sleep several times a night. My nuero said it gets better over a span of 2-3 months and now it has been 5 months. He upped my dose and I am absolutely miserable .My neuro says I can not stop unless surgery because it will lead to permanent vision loss.	1	April 11, 2021	3
Acetazolamide	Pseudotumor Cerebri	I've been taking this medication for about a month so far. My opening pressure was 36 but I also was throwing up and croppy flopping from anxiety attack with needle in my back and that caused me to be laid up for 2 months alone. When I first started this medication it was miserable to say the least. I had tingles in hands feet and face, felt nauseous and weak, lightheaded, had chest pain also skin peeling. Most of it went away after 2 weeks with a little help of lemonade for nausea and walks as much as I could.  I went to see my nueroptomoplogist and in 18 days I'm done, my swelling is gone and my eye sight is wonderful. It definitely is a struggle to get on this band wagon of a med but it works I can vouch for that. Just remember  lots of potassium and proteins really help to. Hope this helps for others there is a light in the tunnel and there are other medications if this isn't a suitable one for you. Shunt should be last option due to all the risk factors that happens with it.	10	April 4, 2021	2
Acetazolamide	Glaucoma	First of all oh my god the taste of soda is god awful it started the first day I was on it I'm on day 14 I get the tingle in my finger tips I feel nausea and a bit dizzy but then it goes away and comes back. Last but not least the most explosive diarrhea I have ever experienced in my life and I had really bad stomach bug the diarrhea from this stuff is so much crazier.  The bowel sounds and stomach and intenstine gurgles are insane they're so loud as soon as I hear them I have to go destroy the toilet bowl with my diarrhea all over it. Oh my god it does help with eye pressure tho I will say that but oh my god I wish I knew how to get rid of these side effects	3	April 2, 2021	0
Acetazolamide	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Hydrocephalus	At first I was diagnosed with idiopathic intracranial hypotension (IIH) by some Neuro.  But I was on mega doses at that time.  Lost all muscles and any weight that I had.   I was 24.  Weighed in 190 male 6 foot 1.  So good build and a good weight. Not no fat like they say that it always causes or vi versa .  Or etc.  Never had a seizure until that med.  I had other problems when 16 years old etc.  But was a lot better from 18 on up.    But the only reason to go was a headache, it was crippling headache  that kept me in the bed almost all the time   and I seen neuro surgeon.     Went from IIH  to constructed hydrocephalus.   To the next shunt  I lost 5 to ten years I don't remember at all.  Went crossed eyed.  With just one eye.      When I was 24-27.   Had 20-20.    That happen.         I couldn't see anything.       Everything was seeing 2 or 3 of something.   Went on for a year.      Ok.  I'm done.   Have had 7 or 8 surgeries in 4 years etc.  Not counting eye.	4	March 20, 2021	0
Acetazolamide	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Mountain Sickness / Altitude Sickness	Absolute game changer for skiing at high altitude, I thought I would inevitably spend the first few days sick and anxious from being out of breath. I did have some Dizziness and pins and needles “electric feeling”, but this side effect was worth feeling so much better and enjoying my holiday.	9	December 28, 2020	0
Acetazolamide	Pseudotumor Cerebri	I am taking acetazolamide 500mg twice daily for pseudo tumor cerebri. I had to have a lumbar puncture to relieve the pressure. My neurologist says that I need to plan to take this med for at least 2 years.  You can’t drink soda when you’re on this medication. It tastes like acid burning your tongue and throat if you try to drink it. When I first started this, I had terrible tingling in my face, lips and the top of my head. Now it is rare for me to experience this. I experience tingly fingers multiple times daily. I have tingling and uncomfortable feet at least once or twice daily. It’s not necessarily numb - it’s an uncomfortable pins and needles feeling.   No one else has stated this but I feel like I have to urinate all of the time, but when I pee it feels like I can’t go all of the way. Like I’m unable to empty my bladder. Overall the medication does what it is supposed to and the fluid and pressure has decreased dramatically in just 5 months. I hate the side effects however.	10	December 15, 2020	18
Acetazolamide	Pseudotumor Cerebri	I have just used it for 1year but there's no change.	4	November 1, 2020	2
Acetazolamide	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Pseudotumor Cerebri	I got meningitis and and I thankfully I healed. I told my doctors several times my vision is not good, I can not see very well. I have double vision. But I didn’t have any chance to see an eye doctor in the hospital. I was discharged  from hospital with my vision problem. So I decided to go an eye doctor. Eye doctor saw that Papilledema back of my eye and it  was scary because he told me this is emergency you can be blind. I just scared. And he was great doctor he told me they will probably give you diamox if it wouldn’t work they will put a shunt. And I went to the hospital they told me the same thing. And they start giving me diamox 500 mg in the morning 500 mg in the night 2 doses in a day. I used for 5 months and it worked. I cured thanks God. But I lost weight also for helping this situation. I lost 20 kg in 5 months. I was 100 kgs now I am 80 kgs. Definitely respect this medicine take your medicine on time. Don’t use and alcohol. Stay healthy. God bless you all.	10	October 13, 2020	13
Acetazolamide	Pseudotumor Cerebri	I have been on diamox since July 2019. I take it to treat my idiopathic intracranial hypertension. I was getting really bad headaches and my my vision was blacking out. I started on 250 mg once in the morning and once at night. I noticed almost immediately that my vision wasn’t blacking out anymore. I was still getting headaches, which I did t think was going to go away because I have been getting migraines since I was 7 years old. At first the side effects were very prominent. My hands and feet would tingle all the time and go numb. I was always hearing a loud swooshing sound following by a ringing in my ears. It has been over a year since I started taking diamox and now I take 1000 mg once in the morning and once at night. I still deal with migraines but the pressure in my eyes has decreased significantly. My feet still tingle sometimes and the ringing in my ears still happens. I would rather deal with those two things than lose my vision multiple times a day.	9	September 21, 2020	6
Acetazolamide	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Pseudotumor Cerebri	I was diagnosed with pseudotumor cerebri. Lets start off with for about 3 years I have had the worst pressure headache every single day.  One day I noticed I had a new pulsating wooshing sound with my headache. I was vomiting. The next day I went to the store and noticed I couldn't see anything around me. It slowly started to get worse. One day I woke up and could not see at all. They immediately did exams , CT scans and an MRI. I also seen and specialist ophthalmologist who instantly seen how swollen my optic nerves were and suggested I be admitted for a lumbar puncture. My opening pressure was 54. They drained it to 15. Its almost been a month and I have only had 1 head ache. My vision came back but still is not 100% at all. Right now I am on 1,000 MG's of diamox twice a day. I have no complaints about it yet other then tingling in my feet and constant urination. Just make sure you drink lots of water and take a potassium supplement. I'm being seen by neuro ophthalmology once a week.	10	September 18, 2020	10
Acetazolamide	Pseudotumor Cerebri	Acetazolamide is fantastic for pseudotumor cerebri ! Fast relief from the cacophony of noises in my head, that headache I thought I didn't have because I was so used to it went away, what I thought was sciatica that never let up disappeared, and my neck and shoulders felt like they got a massage. I had to get a spinal tap first and that's when the noise let up. It took a few days for the other things to go, but what a blessing! I felt the horrible side effects as I was leaving the hospital, but I knew what to do. Research.  A few notes in case you need help with the side effects of acetazolamide: most medications take something from you in return for what they do. In this case, it's folate. I strongly suggest any time you take this or any kind of psychotropic medication, take a good quality B Complex vitamin. This one also takes electrolytes. Emergen-C is a good way to help that. And drink a lot of water!   I'm still losing weight and it's not all water anymore embrace the side effects that can help. Strong 10 out of 10 for Acetazolamide!	10	September 2, 2020	1
Acetazolamide	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Mountain Sickness / Altitude Sickness	Diamox is freaking MAGIC.  I used to get horrible, debilitating headaches at altitude in Breckenridge and Crested Butte.  And if I had a beer, well, it was so much worse. I told my doctor, an avid skier, about it and he prescribed Diamox/acetazolamide.  Game changer.  Not that I condone this, but I could hang with the 20-somethings in the bar 'til closing  and wake in the AM feeling great and ready to go.  Since then I don't go about 8000 feet without following the protocol.	10	August 30, 2020	5
Acetazolamide	Pseudotumor Cerebri	I started on acetazolamide for psuedotumor and was originally put on 1000mg a day, 500mg am and 500mg PM. I was getting really awful headaches so my dr took me down to 250mg in the am and 250mg in the PM for a week. After that week I went back up to 500mg in the am and 500mg in the pm. The side effect symptoms I have was everything carbonated tasted like metal, so I can only drink water, tea and juice. My hands, feet and lips tingle like the same tingling when your feet fall asleep. Its annoying but it doesn't affect my grip and it's not painful. I also pee all the time and I'm dealing with some acid reflux. But it is not too bad. My pain before this medicine is almost completely gone! I was scared to start this medicine after reading all the awful reviews, but now, I'm thankful I started it!	10	July 27, 2020	4

Acetazolamide	Hydrocephalus	I have been taking This since 2002 which is 28 years, I have never had luck with generics. Every generic I have taken doesn’t take all the pressure out of my head. There is only one generic that has worked for me and that is By Zydus Pharmaceuticals. Now there are two other generics besides this one that do absolutely nothing for the fluid pain my head. But this particular one works like half way. I will feel somewhat okay for about an hour a day and then late at nite I might get another hour where my head feels good. From what I have read my understanding is these companies who are making the generics are using different inactive ingredients which make my body not absorb medication as fast as the fluid is filling. I haven’t worked in almost a year. I’m always sick. I’m tired of it! Generics should be exactly like the brand! When I used to take TEVA Diamox I never had any issues. My life was fine I was working and living. Now I’m on generic living a terrible quality of life !	3	June 28, 2020	4
Acetazolamide	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Pseudotumor Cerebri	So I just found out I have IH due to there is a golf ball sized tumor in the vascular sinus of my brain. From the MRV it shows stretching and scaring on the opposite side they believe in December/January when the headaches got so bad is when that happened. I received the results two Fridays ago. This Diamos is killing me my kidneys hurt my urine is coffee colored and smell weird. I know TMI. The nuerologist nurse practitioner keeps telling me it's. Normal side effects however I haven't eaten in 5 days and if I take a drink I better be VERY near to the potty. This drug is killing me I'm sure. And I'm still in pain still hear things cry always going crazy but my vision does not have black stripes and no peripheral vision.	1	June 21, 2020	7
Acetazolamide	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Mountain Sickness / Altitude Sickness	At age 37, I decided to take my 1st ever mountain camping trip. We found a beautiful spot at 12,497 Ft. I had been to Denver as a teenager with no reaction to altitude so I wasn’t expecting to get sick. I hydrated, but evidently not enough. Within 4 hours of making camp, I began feeling nauseous. After 6 hours, diarrhea. By 10 hours, around midnight, I was going in and out of consciousness. We thought I had severe food poisoning. Due to the dangerous location, we could not get down from the mountain. Long story short, when I returned home to Dallas Texas, I had had a mild edema. My doctor prescribed Diamox and portable oxygen for my next mountain trip. It really gets the job done. I have played around with the dosing starting at half doses &add more up to the full dose as needed. I begin Diamox 48 hours before ascending over 9.5k. I find smaller dosing decreases the drowsiness.  I hope this information helps others. Be safe and well.	10	June 11, 2020	8
Acetazolamide	Glaucoma	I was only prescribed this medication for 3 days following an eye procedure , I generally steer away from any prescription meds as much as possible.  I experienced horrible tingling hands and feet /  mild nausea , a little light headed,  the worst symptom was extreme fatigue,   Very relieved when the 3 day course was up.	3	June 7, 2020	7
Acetazolamide	Pseudotumor Cerebri	It made my headaches and vision considerably worse at a low dose (250mg b.i.d.). Caused a number of other side effects: horrible numbness and tingling on hands, feet, arms, legs and face; fatigue; loss of appetite; nausea; vomiting; diarrhea; tons of kidney stones; muscle weakness; severe muscle cramping; loss of bladder control; loss of muscle control (unable to move fingers, face twitching); loss of feeling on hands and feet; cyanosis of extremities.	1	June 1, 2020	9
Acetazolamide	Pseudotumor Cerebri	acetazolamide literally has not worked or helped my pseudotumor cerebri at all	3	May 24, 2020	7
Acetazolamide	Pseudotumor Cerebri	I have dealt with years of intracranial hypertension, which after this lockdown and putting on 'a few pounds' in such a short space of time, I came out of remission. Ended up back in hospital having a lumbar puncture once again, and my neurologist decided to put me on these tablets. I am on 3x 250mg It is safe to say I have had near all of the side effects (I am on day 6) and so far..... Lightheadedness, severe fatigue, tingling in my  fingers, feet, face, lips.. but I tend to giggle them off. I found the energy to go for a walk yesturday and today (not alone, too scared incase I get too lightheaded) the tingling intensifies. I can not drink anything fizzy, the taste is just awful! I get tiny headaches but nothing compared to what I had to deal with when going through IIH.  I thought about stopping the medication, but I will persevere for now and see how I get on for the next month.  It is lucky I am on Furlough, or there is no way I would be able to handle taking them and work.	3	May 4, 2020	10
Acetazolamide		I am using acetazolamide to help with my Ménière’s Disease. I’m only on 250 mg but need to work up to 500 mg daily. I feel like I’m in a fog and extremely tired. The pins and needles in my hands, feet and face come and go.  Is there anyone else using acetazolamide to help with Ménière’s symptoms? I can’t tell if it’s making them worse or better.	6	March 10, 2020	6
Acetazolamide	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Hydrocephalus	I had to take this medication due to me having fluid around the brain. The doctors stated I had swelling behind my eyes which caused headaches and lost of vision. This medicine was disgusted the least to say. When I started this medicine I was 177.lb I weighed 155 by the time I finished the bottle. I had no appetite, no sex drive, dry moth and could only drink water or a juice I found that I liked and could actually taste! Soda tasted like metal. I took this medicine for 4 weeks. In August I had Shunt surgery! That was one of the best decisions of my life. My vision is a lot better and I’m free to wear whatever I like! Hope you all get better soon! If you have another options other than taking this medicine by all means do so! You will be a lot happier and not miserable!!!!	3	February 12, 2020	16
Acetazolamide	Pseudotumor Cerebri	"I was diagnosed with pesudotumor cerebri in 2017 and have been on this medication for over 2 years.  Together with a healthy diet and exercise I've managed to loose about 20kg so have been slowly allowed to go off it.  My papiledema has improved significantly to the point where it is unnoticeable and I'm currently ""under observation"".  During my time on this medication I've experienced some tingling in my extremities, dry mouth and coughs, changes in the taste of certain foods and GI issues such as heartburn.   I did have to get back on it after about two months off due to taking ADHD medications who elevated my ICP, but the GI issues were so severe that my neurologist prescribed me a different medication, since my ICP is now under control.   This medication has some severe side effects, but it also works and in my case it helped save my eyesight and it's preferable to having a lumbar puncture every few months."	7	February 9, 2020	4
Acetazolamide		Man , so I just was going to my eye doctor for a check up about my left eye having pressure, having head aches but I started a green smoothie diet started feeling better. But she sent me to the ER to have an emergency cat scan as she had seen something. So I had a MRI & brain and and spinal cord because I had so much pressure on it ( Idiopathic intracranial hypertension - IIH) But I feel I could have went with out all of this including the medication I hate taking it sometimes I don't want to take it I can't eat , & I feel like I will throw up , & I feel spaced out I don't feel normal 	1	February 4, 2020	9
Acetazolamide	Glaucoma	I've been taking acetazolamide  for glaucoma for 2 weeks now and the lightheadedness, weakness and low energy level is very  troublesome. I've been given no other options, with regards to my eye pressure condition. The weakness and dizziness are like a very bad flu condition.	2	January 26, 2020	5
Acetazolamide	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Pseudotumor Cerebri	"Have been on the med for about 3 weeks.  1 pill - 125mg every night.  Did not help...I still had episodes.  Last week started 2 pills (in the a.m. and one p.m.).  While it seems (so far) to be holding off the episodes, I feel AWFUL.  Ears were already ringing and this has just turned it up.  Nausea.  General feeling of ""I just don't feel well"".  Weakness and fatigue.  Feels like I'm breathing in air but no oxygen...like I'm getting no benefit from it (does that make sense?). Slept for about 8.5-9 hours last night and still woke up completely exhausted."	5	January 14, 2020	26
Acetazolamide	Pseudotumor Cerebri	This medication acetazolamide was horrific at first!!! I had to takeoff work a month just to take it. I started taking a dose of  125mg a night for a week, then 125 x2 a day for a week, then 250 x2 a day fir a week. Now I take 500 mg ER once a day. Next week I go to 500mg  ER 2 x a day.  I was so sick I couldn’t get out of bed the first two weeks. Food and drinks still taste strange, still very sick just not as bad, but sadly trying to adjust as my new normal. Still tingling in hands/feet. Sharp headaches, nausea, breathing issues, tired, eyes look weak, dizzy, always in a haze. Eating anything seems to enhance my nausea. I had trouble walking one week and had to have a epidural steroid shot in my back. I have lived with ringing in both ears for over a year now. The medicine has made my ringing worse! I can’t stop the medicine. So I don’t have a choice. I have to take the medicine or risk going blind. However, I am pretty miserable!!!	7	January 6, 2020	11
Acetazolamide	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Glaucoma	Reduced my eye pressure after a vitrectomy. Initially made me spacey and sleepy with Pins and needles but hey small price to pray to protect my vision and lower my eye pressure from 50 to 40  and so on. Used in conjunction eye drops. I’ve only used short term. I’ve read several other side affects and have experienced the need to go urinate often.	8	December 10, 2019	6
Acetazolamide	Pseudotumor Cerebri	I take 750mg acetazolamide morning and night since 2016. I have ICP and when the fluid around my eyes, brain spinal cord is peaking the nerves in my eye was damaged and my left side would not work. I could not lift my foot or walk, my left arm was weak and my head felt like it was going to explode. Its now October 2019 and I can walk talk and process my thoughts and voice. I am working 45 hours a week and driving.  So the short answer is YES my meds are working but and just about over taking so many meds as the side effects drive me crazy.	9	October 20, 2019	4
Acetazolamide	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Pseudotumor Cerebri	Makes my feet tingle and I hear ringing in my ears all the time	5	September 4, 2019	15
Acetazolamide	Pseudotumor Cerebri	This is by far the worst medication I have ever been on. I’m a week in to taking the medication now and I’m struggling to sleep due to the pins and needles in my face and eyes. It’s just constant. I also suffer with panic disorder and my anxiety has been sky high since starting these tablets.  I recommend to anyone that if you begin these tablets then ask your GP for some propranolol to go with them.	2	September 1, 2019	6
Acetazolamide	Mountain Sickness / Altitude Sickness	I took this medication because I live at sea level and was going to the Rocky Mountains for only three days.  I knew I wouldn't have time to adjust to the altitude during such a short visit and it included a photo excursion at 10,000 feet. Took as directed before ascent and was surprised to find that it helped me sleep AND curbed my appetite.  No side effects and I was able to enjoy the mountains.  About 6 months later, took it again for another mountain visit.  Planning on taking it again in a couple of weeks for next mountain trip.	8	August 31, 2019	0
Acetazolamide	Hydrocephalus	I’m on my 5th day of this acetazolamide tablet now. for Intercranial Hypertension I made an appt at the opticians as I had been suffered with disturbed vision and dizziness for around a year. I went to the opticians where they found my optical nerves were inflamed. Went to the hospital had CT and MRI scans which were normal. Had a lumbar puncture which revealed excess fluid on my spine so they drained some out. For anyone who says that spinal taps aren’t painful, they’re lying. It was horrible. They then put me on these tablets to prevent the fluid from reproducing.  Blurred vision and dizziness seems to be my main symptom along with tingling fingers and toes. I am determined to stick this out though as I have read great things about it.	4	August 27, 2019	11
Acetazolamide	Pseudotumor Cerebri	Acetazolamide gave me breathing problems and fast heartbeat. I hyperventilate when I take it. Sometimes it would come right back up before it reached my stomach. I still had high pressure symptoms. I was very out of it all the time. I felt like I was dying on it. But I was so out of it I couldn't even communicate that. I was on it for a year the first time and a month the second and definitely the last time.	1	August 3, 2019	5
Acetazolamide	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Glaucoma	I don’t like this one bit, the first day I took it I felt like I was having a massive panic attack or I was going to go crazy, I tried to stick it out for a couple more days and take it right before I sleep and that helped but honestly it’s such a pain to eat and take it right before bed and force yourself to sleep otherwise your going to have to go to hospital... it has really red marks whenever I lean on arm, hand. Anyways I don’t like it but everyone’s different so give it a shot :)	1	August 2, 2019	4
Acetazolamide	Pseudotumor Cerebri	I was diagnosed with Pseudotumor Cerebri two months ago and I have been on Diamox for about 6 weeks. So far I have a love-hate relationship with this drug. It got rid of my “snow” almost immediately but the flashing lights and blurriness are still there. Any improvement is great in my opinion. The problem is with the side effects. I have gotten used to the weird food and beverage tastes and the tingling in my hands and feet are annoying but bearable. I have completely lost my energy. I am tired all the time and it is very difficult to find the motivation get through work and do what I need to get done. I feel like garbage a few days a week. I’m really struggling but I am going to try to learn to deal with it.	7	August 1, 2019	6
Acetazolamide	Edema	My ENT prescribed Diamox for Meniere's Disease, a build up of fluid in the inner ear. I will experience tinnitus, vertigo, ear fullness, and visual disturbances, including light sensitivity. Once starting Diamox, all of my symptoms were significantly minimized. I also struggle with migraines and noticed since taking Diamox, I have not had 1 episode. Like others, I experience diarrhea, but increasing my daily water intake has helped. I too also experience tingling in my hands and feet, but it's not intense. I just learned this medicine can suppress appetite, and this does occur with me. I also have more energy, so much, most nights I have insomnia. Has anyone else experienced this? Overall, for me the benefits certainly outweigh the costs. I've been granted a new outlook on life. Before Diamox, the Meniere's left me in a fog, both in vision and hearing. If anyone has also experienced trouble sleeping, please share what you have found to help, I would love to hear it!	8	July 4, 2019	11
Acetazolamide	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Mountain Sickness / Altitude Sickness	I took one of these pills (125mg) to try it before my vacation and I haven't felt so sick in a long time.  OMG it was horrible!!  It started with mild dizziness and tiredness.  Not so bad but by the 12th hour I just wanted to check out.  A lot of dizziness, very tired but couldn't sleep, nausea and headache.  Generally I felt awful but couldn't put my finger on how else it made me feel this awfulness.  I took a meclazine and some Advil and felt a bit better.  The next day, I still felt a bit weird but not so awful.  That stuff lasts a long time and if you take it on vacation and have my reaction, you'll waste a lot of hours being miserable.	1	July 3, 2019	3
Acetazolamide		I have suffered with migraines and severe dizziness and vertigo since I was 6. Neurologist put me on this. I've only taken it for 2 days but my headaches and dizziness are worse, I feel so tired I have double vision, excessively thirsty and tingling in face, hands and feet like pins and needles. I knew it wasn't going to work for my vertigo but was hoping I could tolerate it long enough to get the weight loss side effect, but I'd rather stay fat.	1	June 23, 2019	3
Acetazolamide	Glaucoma	I've been taking this for almost a month now at 500mg a day. Made me terribly sleepy at first and I slept almost all day on the first Sunday (4 days in), terrible abdominal pains, wooly head and nausea plus more frequent urination. Sleepiness has passed and I've been taking the tablets before a meal and that has helped with the abdominal pain. Still waking in the night to visit the loo but daytime urination has normalised. Nausea is a constant though and I have to force myself to eat. The consultant has given me another month's supply, oh joy.	6	June 20, 2019	3
Acetazolamide	Mountain Sickness / Altitude Sickness	Ok so I got these pills for altitude sickness in Peru and I got told to take one half in the morning and one half at night two days before high altitude. So I took a half when I arrived in Arequipa, around 2300m above sea level. With ONLY one small half, my hands started tingling, my whole face and me KNEES and even the upper part of my back. I couldn’t even walk correctly. Now it’s been around 27 hours I only took the half mentioned and my hands are still tingling. It is very annoying and ruined my first day in Arequipa. I won’t be taking them anymore, I prefer dealing with altitude sickness with coca gum and leaves than rather  not being able to use my body correctly. Also it’s true, you go to the bathroon all the time, so it’s no good if you are trekking and don’t have easy access to a toilet.	2	June 5, 2019	2
Acetazolamide	Hydrocephalus	I was diagnosed with Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH) a week ago and have been on the diamox for a week. It’s been a week of awfulness. Hands, feet and full face are numb and tingling. I also feel thumping in my face. I’m so tired and just sick. I’m nauseous ,major anxiety, I feel like I have the flu. I’m trying to get through this but I don’t know how much more I can take. I don’t know if there’s a different kind of medicine I can take for IIH. [if you check the internet there is an article in Medscape about Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH)]	1	May 31, 2019	12
Acetazolamide	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Mountain Sickness / Altitude Sickness	Upon arrival in Lhasa, Tibet at approx 3000 MAS(metres above sea level) I started getting a very bad head ache. Approx 8 hrs later the headache had progressed to extreme throbbing. I drank plenty of water and took diamox as prescribed by my g.p. for altitude sickness. The next day I signed myself up on tour to travel to nam tso @ approx 5000 mas..	10	May 28, 2019	6
Acetazolamide		I have been  acetazolamide drug for 3 months. My memory is foggy. I also have anxiety disorder. This medication has increased my anxiety at high dosage	2	May 14, 2019	3
Acetazolamide	Pseudotumor Cerebri	Acetazolamide isn’t fun but it does work really well for me. The headaches and vision loss I was suffering from pseudotumor cerebri were way worse than the side effects of this medicine. I haven’t noticed any of the side effects alleviating over time. I experienced my hands, mouth and feet tingling so much it hurt. It would wake me up at night and I’d have to walk around till the tingling stopped. My mood and energy have definitely been low since taking this medication. The worst side effect is probably the way food tastes, for me it is almost everything, not just carbonated beverages.	8	April 23, 2019	16
Acetazolamide	Glaucoma	Acetazolamide is great bringing down my eye pressure. I am also eating normally, but losing weight (yay), an unexpected added bonus. The first week left me feeling super down and tired, but now I feel great. In addition to the weight loss bonus my arthritis is way better. I used to hobble from stiff joints, and found it hard to lift my right arm, but not anymore! I am on 500mg twice day, and my eye pressure drops within minutes of taking it. There is a diarrhea side effect sometimes, but it isn't so bad for me. I drink a lot of water while taking this and that seems to help.	8	April 9, 2019	10
Acetazolamide	Diamox (acetazolamide)	I just started taking Acetazolamide 1/2 pill of 250 mg tab  for my   ringing in my left ear and I'm feeling tired and kind of weak I feel like going back to bed. My ENT DR prescribed this, does anyone else out there have similar problems??		March 30, 2019	8
Acetazolamide	Glaucoma	My worst side effect experience is lack of appetite and lethargy at times, now I have some diarrhea. But my eye pressure is down to 18 in one eye 13 in the left as of last check, but the loss off appetite concerns me	7	March 20, 2019	4
Acetazolamide	Pseudotumor Cerebri	My doctors had me taking 1500mg 2x a day, my headaches went away. I had problems getting the medication so I started taking 1000mg 2x a day and I was doing well, if I didn’t take any at all I would be able to go 2-3 days before getting a headache. I went about 6 months no medication and with no headaches before they started up again. I was able to get a hold of the medication but  I’m having trouble getting refills, I’ve been taking 2 pills every night and It works but I can feel them slowly coming back. I’ve been taking these pills for almost 4 years now and I’ve tried everything to take care of it, I’ve lost weight, taken headache OTC pills, coffee helps but not to get rid of them — please if anyone knows of an alternative to the medication that can help— willing to try anything at this point TBH.	10	January 27, 2019	7
Acetazolamide	Pseudotumor Cerebri	I was taking this 3x a day and it helped my ICP that began after brain surgery, but it slowly began to make me severely depressed and I didn’t realize that was the problem, until I ran out and went 2 days without it and my mood improved drastically. Not sure what to do now. Will see dr in 2 days	5	January 6, 2019	5
Acetazolamide	Pseudotumor Cerebri	I was on Diamox for about 2 months & it definitely helped. My worst side effect of it was a pressure that built on the bridge of my nose from it and my face would feel “shaky”. Hate it!	7	December 24, 2018	6
Acetazolamide	Hydrocephalus	I have Rebound Intracranial Hypertension (from Hypotension) .I was originally diagnosed with idiopathic intracranial HYPOtension (leaking spinal fluid), so I couldn't stand upright without my brain feeling like it was getting crushed.  Got a blood patch, was fixed for awhile, but now I'm one of the rare cases of now having too much spinal fluid, so my brain feels like its going to explode. I could've risked either a spinal tap (and possible lead back to the original hypotension) or go on Acetazolamide to reduce the amount of fluids in my body and my head.  Typical side effects everyone mentions here - soda tastes like garbage, and I get tingling hands/feet. I'm on one tablet of 250mg per day, and it's been able to stop the exploding headaches. I've been warned to see an optometrist to make sure the pressure isn't enough to cause optical nerve damage, but other than that, this is a working solution for me. Hoping to eventually ween myself off it.	10	December 6, 2018	12
Acetazolamide	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Mountain Sickness / Altitude Sickness	DO NOT if you have panic disorder. Had the worst panic attack of my life hours after taking it and thought I was gonna pass out and/or die. Guess I’ll just have to face the altitude sickness bc you couldn’t pay me ten trillion dollars to take this again.   FYI I think most people do not have this experience, just warning those who have bad anxiety!	1	October 19, 2018	7
Acetazolamide	Pseudotumor Cerebri	This medicine helped my migraines stop, but it caused me an insane amount of fatigued when I started it and when I stopped it. My hands, legs, feet, and sometimes other body parts tingled nonstop. Sometimes the tingle was so strong, it actually hurt. My hands tingled so much so that I couldn’t write, so I had to use my computer to take notes instead.  The one good thing from this medicine was the horrible migraines I’ve been suffering through never once occurred.	8	October 5, 2018	10
Acetazolamide	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Pseudotumor Cerebri	I had Pseudotumor Cerebri and  Papilledema (an eye condition that happens when pressure in your brain makes your optic nerve swell.) I was blind for 14 days. After taking Diamox I slowly regained my vision. I also had Gastric Bypass Surgery. This had me reduce my weight and any pressure. I am now cured.	9	October 2, 2018	65
Acetazolamide	Glaucoma	I am home from cataract surgery  have taken 3 pills. The soles of my feet were tingling with such intensity they hurt.  Did not last long, then around my mouth started tingling, feels like I ate as mango which I am highly allergic to.  Afraid to take the  last one	7	August 23, 2018	2
Acetazolamide	Pseudotumor Cerebri	I was diagnosed in 2013, I was told you have pressure headaches,  and I thought no big deal.  I stopped going to my Neuro Dr and he failed to give me the actual Dx or even tell me how serious my DX is.  I only learned I have IIH in 2018 when I requested my medical records, due to a worsening of my headaches, pulsating tinnutis, dizziness, visual disturbance, eye pain,  pressure, horrific headaches,  and feeling like I will live with a migraine like headache everyday of my life. I don't know about anyone else but when you start to think Trepanation (making a hole in your head) could be a good thing you know it is bad. I am now taking Acetazolamide again. Day 2: change in taste buds, carbonated drinks taste awful, cheese is terrible... Tingling in lips, face and hands.  Moderate stomach pain. Feelings of lethargy, decreased appetite,  generally feel unwell. My Dr advised some or all will go away.		July 6, 2018	9
Acetazolamide	Hydrocephalus	I have Chiari Malformation Type 1. (Basically, part of my brain is squeezing through the opening at the base of the skull where the spinal cord enters, and is putting pressure on the spinal cord - it's a congenital thing in almost all cases, but for me wasn't diagnosed until age 34. I have scoliosis, chronic pain, and chronic migraines all caused by the Chiari.) Was put on 125mg Diamox twice a day. So far it's reduced the severity of my migraines but not their frequency, and hasn't done anything for the pain. The tingling is the only side effect that hasn't gone away, and most of the time it doesn't bother me, but sometimes it's intense enough that I feel like I'm suffering oxygen deprivation from hyperventilating - my hands even start to go stiff. If I didn't know it was a meds side effect it'd be pretty worrying. Still, more pros than cons for me.	7	June 28, 2018	1
Acetazolamide	Glaucoma	I took this medicine once and the side effects are horrible. It decreases my potassium to the point that I felt the pressure on my head and it feels like I was about to collapse. My whole body started to feel numb and I was shaking and scared. (I was about to panic when I felt that numbness all over my body ) but I stayed calm and rested but I can still feel the tingling sensation. I pee a lot , dizziness and I feel like it triggers my anxiety.   But this medicine helped my eye pressure. I just took this once  and I will never take that again. Earlier I went to my opthamologist and he is kind of shocked that I said I was about to collapse and he said that don't take that medicine because of the side effects.  Right now I can still feel the tingling in my fingers and foot.  Ijust ate banana and it helps...	3	June 22, 2018	5
Acetazolamide	Pseudotumor Cerebri	I felt horrible for the first two weeks after being diagnosed with  pseudotumor cerbri, and taking the medicine 1000mg a day. The tingling in my hands face and toes comes and goes. I have had no more headaches or pressure in my sinuses since the first few weeks of starting it.	6	April 20, 2018	6
Acetazolamide	Glaucoma	I was diagnosed with intermediate uveitis 5 weeks ago and recently started on Diamox 2 weeks ago after my eye pressure started increasing from the steroid drops I am on. The first couple days I was much more tired and almost foggy minded. Also had to urinate much more often. Than after the first couple days, my body got very used to it. The only main symptom I have now is light tingling in my feet. My eye pressure was down from 39 to 28 in a weeks time.		April 7, 2018	7
Acetazolamide	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Edema	I was given diamox to treat bilateral ringing in the ears, headaches and pressure behind my eyes. I am 39 years old and I have lived with ringing in my ears all of my life. I have tried every available option out there to treat tinnitus and nothing has worked. I was referred to a new specialist dealing with ear diseases and he asked me a few questions and then prescribed diamox. Within 2 hours of taking diamox the ringing in my ears stopped completely and the pressure behind my eyes went away as well as headaches I've dealt with for years. I was shocked that this medicine is working as one of the side effects was ringing in the ears but I am having the opposite effect.	10	April 5, 2018	16
Acetazolamide	Glaucoma	This is the third time taking acetazolamide.  The main side effect for me is the eggy taste inmy mouth, constant loose bowels, numbness in my hands and feet and face, feeling cold, tired and week. think I've tried almost every eye drop on the market and pressures are still over 40.  I'm on this medication for 2 months four times a day.  My operation is on 3/5/18 really hoping the side effects ease off soon it's beginning to get me down.	6	March 19, 2018	4
Acetazolamide	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Glaucoma	Its a good medicine to decrease the Eye pressure.  While taking this tab - depression and dark thoughts are more and I have no interest in food, and also my  hands tickle like they are  in water.  Now I've stopped the medicine, my eye pressure become normal and constant. After stopping the medicine it takes a few  days  to decrease all the worst symptoms.   	8	February 17, 2018	13
Acetazolamide	Hydrocephalus	I am currently on this medication 500mg 2x's a day to treat the excess fluid gain on my brain that causes seizures. The first dose of this medication I instantly had a really bad taste for soda and for most anything that I ate or drank. I experienced extreme tiredness dizziness headaches and had a decrease in appetite. After about 2 days I noticed numbness and tingling in my hands and feet ringing in my ears a stabbing pressure pain in my eyes and abdominal pain I had to pee every 20-30 min and had extreme diarrhea instantly after every meal, all my bowel movements are diarrhea. After telling my neurologist about it he said they are common and to take once a day for 2 weeks to let my body adjust then back to 2x's. I fluctuate back and forth with the once and twice a day because he will not let me stop taking it and all of the affects still remain after 8 months of treatment but it has decreased the fluid levels on my brain and I lost 30 pounds are the only benefits	3	February 13, 2018	7
Acetazolamide	Pseudotumor Cerebri	I have been on Diamox for 3 weeks. I continue to have severe headaches still same pressure on my eyes and head. I can not stay awake taking this medicine. I get up and try to sit on couch and within 5 min I’m out. I see a Neurosurgeon in 3 days and I hope he can help me. I can’t even walk properly because my balance is so off. My wife is typing this as I speak.	1	February 5, 2018	6
Acetazolamide	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Pseudotumor Cerebri	I am 18 years old and I was diagnosed with pseudotumor cerebri after an allergic reaction to long term use of tetracyclines for acne. I went to the ER twice experiencing persistent, debilitating migraines, double vision, and one eye turned to face inward towards my nose, and they were unable to relieve any of it. My eye doctor, after a month of different testing, diagnosed me with pseudotumor cerebri and a neurologist started me on diamox and within two weeks my eye turned straight again, and the headaches and double vision were gone. I experienced the common tingling in my hands and feet, difficulty drinking carbonated beverages, small rashes, and lethargy from diamox, but it was all bearable after a week and within a month I am fixed.	10	December 19, 2017	39
Acetazolamide	Pseudotumor Cerebri	All I have to say is that this pill has made my life so much better. Three years ago this pseudotumor cerebri started after having my first born. I was at my heaviest at 245lb pounds. Ever since I've never been the same until now although I deal with the side effects (sleepy, muscle weakness , tiredness, tingling ) being sleepy has been the worst to cope with because I'm a mother and I have things to do BUT at least some days I'm able to function well and that's better than nothing. I also take Potassium which helps a lot for the tingling !!! I hope one day I no longer have to take these pills and finally have my life back and enjoy it ! BTW I'm 21 yrs old	6	December 18, 2017	8
Acetazolamide	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Pseudotumor Cerebri	I have been on Diamox since 2004 when I was first diagnosed with a pseudotumor cerebri. I was hospitalized for 5 days after experiencing paralysis in my legs, severe headaches, nausea and visual impairment.  I have tried to stop taking the medication but had to return to it due to the severe headaches and cranial swelling.  I have constant problems with electrolyte deficiencies and have to take additional medications to alleviate other problems.  This is still the best treatment I have experienced.  In addition to this condition, I also have Lupus, HBP, Hypothyroidism and I am Bi-polar.	9	December 4, 2017	26
Acetazolamide	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Pseudotumor Cerebri	Side effects far worse than  Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH) it's self. Constantly nauseous, made no difference to headaches/pressure, suffered with slight breathing difficulties & palpitations, the tingling in hands and feet were more like cramp than tingling in the end... the list goes on..	1	November 12, 2017	20
Acetazolamide	Glaucoma	My eye pressure was up in the 40s and Dr. gave me 1 pill only to help get it down. About 20 mins later I started  feeling numbness all over my legs, arms, nose and upper lip. It was annoying but not painful. I was needing to pee very often and was super low energy the rest of the day. Glad I only had to take the 1 pill. It  only slightly helped the eye  pressure issue.	5	September 20, 2017	4
Acetazolamide	Glaucoma	For lowering pressure the medication is very effective, however the side effects are a nightmare. I get tingling sensations everywhere, dehydration, increased urine, drowsiness. It doesn't help that I'm also a teenager who needs to concentrate on my studies so it's a miracle I managed to get through school recently.	5	September 3, 2017	6
Acetazolamide	Pseudotumor Cerebri	I was diagnosed with Pseudotumor Cerebri in February 2015. When I got pregnant with my son I gained over 60lbs. I had him in May 2014 and didn't have any symptoms until October 2014 when my eyesight went out for a second or two and it didn't happen again. I didn't pay it any mind until in January 2015 it started getting worse. My vision would go in and out for about 2-5 seconds at a time. I finally seen the ophthalmologist who said my optic nerves were swollen & referred me to a neurologist who had me do an MRI, 1 spinal tap (where my pressure was so high at 44, so they relieved some of the spinal fluid down to 20), then they finally decided to put me on Acetazolamide 500mg ER. The only cons were the metallic taste and tingling.	9	July 17, 2017	14
Acetazolamide	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Pseudotumor Cerebri	Works amazingly!	10	June 24, 2017	19
Acetazolamide	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Mountain Sickness / Altitude Sickness	Anyone planning to take this medication for altitude sickness prophylaxis, I recommend you do a trial run at home first. I took this medication to hike the inca trail and started it the day before flying to Cusco. I developed a rare side effect of blurred vision/myopia which came on about an hour after the second dose of diamox. The myopia lasted for 72 hours after ceasing the medication. It almost ruined my trip but fortunately vision returned just in time to start the hike. I went on dexamethasone after that for prophylaxis. No side effects but unfortunately the Dex didn't work as I got altitude sickness.........but that's another story!		June 23, 2017	16
Acetazolamide	Pseudotumor Cerebri	My experience with acetazolamide has been okay. I started taking it after my lumbar puncture to relieve the pressure.  (I got IIH because it was a rare side effect of an antibiotic I was on for my acne, minocycline) it has been VERY effective at relieving the pressure, but gives really annoying side effects, like tingling of my fingers, face, and toes. Like when I'm trying to sleep my feet tingle and go crazy and it makes it impossible to sleep. It also made me have little to no appetite and I have lost 20 pounds in about 2 months. I my neurologist told me that long term use of this medication can cause kidney damage, but 6 months to a year shouldn't be a worry. (I am only going to be on diamox for 6 months. I've been on it for 4 months)	7	June 23, 2017	8
Acetazolamide	Pseudotumor Cerebri	I was just recently diagnosed with high intracranial pressure with no papilledema and a huge blind spot I my left eye. I was told that a spinal tap would only cause a leak since I have a connective tissue disorder. I got an MRI and CT and everyone said they were normal excect for Dr. Driscoll. She started me on diamox and it has done wonders!!! I can see at dark now and I don't have constant eye pain/pressure, neck pain or problems sleeping. I have to sleep with a soft cervical collar and had to raise the head of my bed to make sure the fluid continues to drain even when sleeping. I do have numbness and tingling but it's more amusing to me than painful. It is difficult to keep your CO2 levels at 22 but use alkaline h20	8	June 17, 2017	7
Acetazolamide	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Pseudotumor Cerebri	Confusion, lethargy, diarrhea, hyperchloremia, CO2 16, nausea, dizziness	1	June 2, 2017	10
Acetazolamide	Pseudotumor Cerebri	"I was 19 when I was sent from my small town & county to have tests done. I'd had symptoms from age 12 when I was put on birth control pills for PCOS. The Dr from San Francisco put me on Diamox and prednisone and ordered my family Dr do a spinal tap when I had eye problems or severe headaches (he did at least 3/wk for 2yrs). My family Dr took me off the prednisone after a few months and I gained over 100lbs. The Diamox caused me weird side effects. My face was all ""tingling"", everything I ate or drank tasted metallic (especially if it was fruit or carbonated). Eventually the tingling started down my neck, chest, and hands/arms. So my Dr took me off it, gave me hydroclorathazide (it maybe misspelt). I've learned Diamox causes it a lot."	2	April 18, 2017	2
Acetazolamide	Pseudotumor Cerebri	I'm 28 and I was diagnosed with  Pseudotumor  a little over two years now I've had a VP shunt an LP shunt  and multiple lumbar punctures,  I've been taking  Acetazolmide  and I've had no side effects so far...  but I'm still having really bad headache's and swelling of my eyeballs,  so yesterday my neurologist decided that instead of taking two  pills in the morning and two pills at night,  I'll start taking three pills in the morning and three pills at night.  I just want to feel better!	10	March 19, 2017	3
Acetazolamide	Pseudotumor Cerebri	I've been taking this medication regularly for the past month and want to cry.  I'm 20 years old, a healthy female, and was diagnosed with pseudotumor cerebri.  I call my mom nearly everyday complaining of a new pain.  From the horrible tingly sensation in my hands and feet, to the horrible confusion, and now extreme pain in my abdomen, I'm ready for this all to stop.  I'm on 500 mg/daily and can't even operate my vehicle!  I am always so out of it it makes finished my homework assignments difficult let alone to constant new pains I always complain about.  I am pretty tough but when it comes to seeing my doctor every week due to the side effects of this medication, it's not worth it.	1	March 6, 2017	12
Acetazolamide	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Pseudotumor Cerebri	Hello. I am 18 and I have diagnosed with Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) December of 2016. As we all thought, I had a concussion because I played volleyball but it didn't quite flow with the big blind spot in my left eye and the perfect MRI and MRE scan results. Well, as my opening pressure from an LP was 49.7, more than half for my age, and being the first patient for my pediatrician, I have Psuedo Tumor Cerebri. My new neurologists put me on 2,000mg a day. Yes, this caused severe abdominal and GI upset for almost the first month I was taking it and a little bit here and there. My ophthalmologist has seen an improvement. My second LP as of 1/30/17 had an opening pressure of 28.7. They drained me to normal and took 10cc of instead of 8. I hope it keeps working.	8	February 19, 2017	22
Acetazolamide	Pseudotumor Cerebri	I just started acetazolemide a few days ago.  500mg 2x a day.  I had an lumbar puncture 2 days ago and neither have relieved much of the pressure.  Every time I take one of these pills I get a new symptom.  My kidney function has been weaker.  The pressure in my head continues.  My body aches all over.  The yucky taste....that is the least of my worries.  Pins and needles...check.  Extremely tired and feel like I've been beat.  I feel like bricks are laying inside my hips.  This stuff sucks!!	1	February 19, 2017	11
Acetazolamide	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Mountain Sickness / Altitude Sickness	After several bird tours flirting with 10,000 - 11,000 ft elevation I became suspicious that I was  susceptible to alt. sickness.  A redirected flight to LaPaz, Bolivia (and some unscheduled ascents near Cochabamba) convinced me I was.  Typically I serve as a human altimeter, within minutes of reaching 11,000 ft I'm puking my guts out.  Diamox has been a wonder drug in preventing alt. sickness on tours I've been on since Bolivia.  I've travelled from 8,000 ft straight to 14,000 ft several times with no alt. sickness symptoms at all.  125 mg before bed is all I need.  Tingling and bad tasting soda symptoms are greatly reduced at that dosage compared to the 250mg I initially used.	10	February 15, 2017	10
Acetazolamide	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Pseudotumor Cerebri	Diamox changed my life I had 24/7 pressure headache for 7 years of my life I went everywhere even to the mayo clinic and had test after test and scan after scan and finally my local neurologist tried this medication and it has made me able to live again for the first time in 7 years! I was diagnosed with chronic daily headache and told I would never get better but to everyone suffering there is hope don't believe what a few drs say keep searching for answers. Try this medication if nothing else has worked for you!	8	February 11, 2017	29
Acetazolamide Capsules	Pseudotumor Cerebri	I have been diagnosed with IIH (Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension) they put me on diamox. I am a rarer case because I am a thin woman compared to most. They hoped the diamox will help bring down the fluid. I started on 250mg twice daily. Anything carbonated tasted dull and metallic. My ENTIRE body will tingle and go numb but at different times throughout the day multiple times. The WORST experience for me is I am peeing all the time and my face is also breaking out, and my hands are numb and tingling for HOURS throughout the day. Overall the pins/needles in my feet up to my knees are so PAINFUL. It feels like glass/knives and this is no exaggeration. I am left in tears and it happens many times a day on each leg and I wake up out of my sleep several times a night. My nuero said it gets better over a span of 2-3 months and now it has been 5 months. He upped my dose and I am absolutely miserable .My neuro says I can not stop unless surgery because it will lead to permanent vision loss.	1	April 11, 2021	3
Acetazolamide Capsules	Pseudotumor Cerebri	I've been taking this medication for about a month so far. My opening pressure was 36 but I also was throwing up and croppy flopping from anxiety attack with needle in my back and that caused me to be laid up for 2 months alone. When I first started this medication it was miserable to say the least. I had tingles in hands feet and face, felt nauseous and weak, lightheaded, had chest pain also skin peeling. Most of it went away after 2 weeks with a little help of lemonade for nausea and walks as much as I could.  I went to see my nueroptomoplogist and in 18 days I'm done, my swelling is gone and my eye sight is wonderful. It definitely is a struggle to get on this band wagon of a med but it works I can vouch for that. Just remember  lots of potassium and proteins really help to. Hope this helps for others there is a light in the tunnel and there are other medications if this isn't a suitable one for you. Shunt should be last option due to all the risk factors that happens with it.	10	April 4, 2021	2
Acetazolamide Capsules	Glaucoma	First of all oh my god the taste of soda is god awful it started the first day I was on it I'm on day 14 I get the tingle in my finger tips I feel nausea and a bit dizzy but then it goes away and comes back. Last but not least the most explosive diarrhea I have ever experienced in my life and I had really bad stomach bug the diarrhea from this stuff is so much crazier.  The bowel sounds and stomach and intenstine gurgles are insane they're so loud as soon as I hear them I have to go destroy the toilet bowl with my diarrhea all over it. Oh my god it does help with eye pressure tho I will say that but oh my god I wish I knew how to get rid of these side effects	3	April 2, 2021	0
Acetazolamide Capsules	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Hydrocephalus	At first I was diagnosed with idiopathic intracranial hypotension (IIH) by some Neuro.  But I was on mega doses at that time.  Lost all muscles and any weight that I had.   I was 24.  Weighed in 190 male 6 foot 1.  So good build and a good weight. Not no fat like they say that it always causes or vi versa .  Or etc.  Never had a seizure until that med.  I had other problems when 16 years old etc.  But was a lot better from 18 on up.    But the only reason to go was a headache, it was crippling headache  that kept me in the bed almost all the time   and I seen neuro surgeon.     Went from IIH  to constructed hydrocephalus.   To the next shunt  I lost 5 to ten years I don't remember at all.  Went crossed eyed.  With just one eye.      When I was 24-27.   Had 20-20.    That happen.         I couldn't see anything.       Everything was seeing 2 or 3 of something.   Went on for a year.      Ok.  I'm done.   Have had 7 or 8 surgeries in 4 years etc.  Not counting eye.	4	March 20, 2021	0
Acetazolamide Capsules	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Mountain Sickness / Altitude Sickness	Absolute game changer for skiing at high altitude, I thought I would inevitably spend the first few days sick and anxious from being out of breath. I did have some Dizziness and pins and needles “electric feeling”, but this side effect was worth feeling so much better and enjoying my holiday.	9	December 28, 2020	0
Acetazolamide Capsules	Pseudotumor Cerebri	I am taking acetazolamide 500mg twice daily for pseudo tumor cerebri. I had to have a lumbar puncture to relieve the pressure. My neurologist says that I need to plan to take this med for at least 2 years.  You can’t drink soda when you’re on this medication. It tastes like acid burning your tongue and throat if you try to drink it. When I first started this, I had terrible tingling in my face, lips and the top of my head. Now it is rare for me to experience this. I experience tingly fingers multiple times daily. I have tingling and uncomfortable feet at least once or twice daily. It’s not necessarily numb - it’s an uncomfortable pins and needles feeling.   No one else has stated this but I feel like I have to urinate all of the time, but when I pee it feels like I can’t go all of the way. Like I’m unable to empty my bladder. Overall the medication does what it is supposed to and the fluid and pressure has decreased dramatically in just 5 months. I hate the side effects however.	10	December 15, 2020	18
Acetazolamide Capsules	Pseudotumor Cerebri	I have just used it for 1year but there's no change.	4	November 1, 2020	2
Acetazolamide Capsules	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Pseudotumor Cerebri	I got meningitis and and I thankfully I healed. I told my doctors several times my vision is not good, I can not see very well. I have double vision. But I didn’t have any chance to see an eye doctor in the hospital. I was discharged  from hospital with my vision problem. So I decided to go an eye doctor. Eye doctor saw that Papilledema back of my eye and it  was scary because he told me this is emergency you can be blind. I just scared. And he was great doctor he told me they will probably give you diamox if it wouldn’t work they will put a shunt. And I went to the hospital they told me the same thing. And they start giving me diamox 500 mg in the morning 500 mg in the night 2 doses in a day. I used for 5 months and it worked. I cured thanks God. But I lost weight also for helping this situation. I lost 20 kg in 5 months. I was 100 kgs now I am 80 kgs. Definitely respect this medicine take your medicine on time. Don’t use and alcohol. Stay healthy. God bless you all.	10	October 13, 2020	13
Acetazolamide Capsules	Pseudotumor Cerebri	I have been on diamox since July 2019. I take it to treat my idiopathic intracranial hypertension. I was getting really bad headaches and my my vision was blacking out. I started on 250 mg once in the morning and once at night. I noticed almost immediately that my vision wasn’t blacking out anymore. I was still getting headaches, which I did t think was going to go away because I have been getting migraines since I was 7 years old. At first the side effects were very prominent. My hands and feet would tingle all the time and go numb. I was always hearing a loud swooshing sound following by a ringing in my ears. It has been over a year since I started taking diamox and now I take 1000 mg once in the morning and once at night. I still deal with migraines but the pressure in my eyes has decreased significantly. My feet still tingle sometimes and the ringing in my ears still happens. I would rather deal with those two things than lose my vision multiple times a day.	9	September 21, 2020	6
Acetazolamide Capsules	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Pseudotumor Cerebri	I was diagnosed with pseudotumor cerebri. Lets start off with for about 3 years I have had the worst pressure headache every single day.  One day I noticed I had a new pulsating wooshing sound with my headache. I was vomiting. The next day I went to the store and noticed I couldn't see anything around me. It slowly started to get worse. One day I woke up and could not see at all. They immediately did exams , CT scans and an MRI. I also seen and specialist ophthalmologist who instantly seen how swollen my optic nerves were and suggested I be admitted for a lumbar puncture. My opening pressure was 54. They drained it to 15. Its almost been a month and I have only had 1 head ache. My vision came back but still is not 100% at all. Right now I am on 1,000 MG's of diamox twice a day. I have no complaints about it yet other then tingling in my feet and constant urination. Just make sure you drink lots of water and take a potassium supplement. I'm being seen by neuro ophthalmology once a week.	10	September 18, 2020	10
Acetazolamide Capsules	Pseudotumor Cerebri	Acetazolamide is fantastic for pseudotumor cerebri ! Fast relief from the cacophony of noises in my head, that headache I thought I didn't have because I was so used to it went away, what I thought was sciatica that never let up disappeared, and my neck and shoulders felt like they got a massage. I had to get a spinal tap first and that's when the noise let up. It took a few days for the other things to go, but what a blessing! I felt the horrible side effects as I was leaving the hospital, but I knew what to do. Research.  A few notes in case you need help with the side effects of acetazolamide: most medications take something from you in return for what they do. In this case, it's folate. I strongly suggest any time you take this or any kind of psychotropic medication, take a good quality B Complex vitamin. This one also takes electrolytes. Emergen-C is a good way to help that. And drink a lot of water!   I'm still losing weight and it's not all water anymore embrace the side effects that can help. Strong 10 out of 10 for Acetazolamide!	10	September 2, 2020	1
Acetazolamide Capsules	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Mountain Sickness / Altitude Sickness	Diamox is freaking MAGIC.  I used to get horrible, debilitating headaches at altitude in Breckenridge and Crested Butte.  And if I had a beer, well, it was so much worse. I told my doctor, an avid skier, about it and he prescribed Diamox/acetazolamide.  Game changer.  Not that I condone this, but I could hang with the 20-somethings in the bar 'til closing  and wake in the AM feeling great and ready to go.  Since then I don't go about 8000 feet without following the protocol.	10	August 30, 2020	5
Acetazolamide Capsules	Pseudotumor Cerebri	I started on acetazolamide for psuedotumor and was originally put on 1000mg a day, 500mg am and 500mg PM. I was getting really awful headaches so my dr took me down to 250mg in the am and 250mg in the PM for a week. After that week I went back up to 500mg in the am and 500mg in the pm. The side effect symptoms I have was everything carbonated tasted like metal, so I can only drink water, tea and juice. My hands, feet and lips tingle like the same tingling when your feet fall asleep. Its annoying but it doesn't affect my grip and it's not painful. I also pee all the time and I'm dealing with some acid reflux. But it is not too bad. My pain before this medicine is almost completely gone! I was scared to start this medicine after reading all the awful reviews, but now, I'm thankful I started it!	10	July 27, 2020	4

Acetazolamide Capsules	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Pseudotumor Cerebri	I am 50 years old with a BMI of 28.9. I was suffering from a headache for 3 month.

Acetazolamide Capsules	Hydrocephalus	I have been taking This since 2002 which is 28 years, I have never had luck with generics. Every generic I have taken doesn’t take all the pressure out of my head. There is only one generic that has worked for me and that is By Zydus Pharmaceuticals. Now there are two other generics besides this one that do absolutely nothing for the fluid pain my head. But this particular one works like half way. I will feel somewhat okay for about an hour a day and then late at nite I might get another hour where my head feels good. From what I have read my understanding is these companies who are making the generics are using different inactive ingredients which make my body not absorb medication as fast as the fluid is filling. I haven’t worked in almost a year. I’m always sick. I’m tired of it! Generics should be exactly like the brand! When I used to take TEVA Diamox I never had any issues. My life was fine I was working and living. Now I’m on generic living a terrible quality of life !	3	June 28, 2020	4
Acetazolamide Capsules	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Pseudotumor Cerebri	So I just found out I have IH due to there is a golf ball sized tumor in the vascular sinus of my brain. From the MRV it shows stretching and scaring on the opposite side they believe in December/January when the headaches got so bad is when that happened. I received the results two Fridays ago. This Diamos is killing me my kidneys hurt my urine is coffee colored and smell weird. I know TMI. The nuerologist nurse practitioner keeps telling me it's. Normal side effects however I haven't eaten in 5 days and if I take a drink I better be VERY near to the potty. This drug is killing me I'm sure. And I'm still in pain still hear things cry always going crazy but my vision does not have black stripes and no peripheral vision.	1	June 21, 2020	7
Acetazolamide Capsules	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Mountain Sickness / Altitude Sickness	At age 37, I decided to take my 1st ever mountain camping trip. We found a beautiful spot at 12,497 Ft. I had been to Denver as a teenager with no reaction to altitude so I wasn’t expecting to get sick. I hydrated, but evidently not enough. Within 4 hours of making camp, I began feeling nauseous. After 6 hours, diarrhea. By 10 hours, around midnight, I was going in and out of consciousness. We thought I had severe food poisoning. Due to the dangerous location, we could not get down from the mountain. Long story short, when I returned home to Dallas Texas, I had had a mild edema. My doctor prescribed Diamox and portable oxygen for my next mountain trip. It really gets the job done. I have played around with the dosing starting at half doses &add more up to the full dose as needed. I begin Diamox 48 hours before ascending over 9.5k. I find smaller dosing decreases the drowsiness.  I hope this information helps others. Be safe and well.	10	June 11, 2020	8
Acetazolamide Capsules	Glaucoma	I was only prescribed this medication for 3 days following an eye procedure , I generally steer away from any prescription meds as much as possible.  I experienced horrible tingling hands and feet /  mild nausea , a little light headed,  the worst symptom was extreme fatigue,   Very relieved when the 3 day course was up.	3	June 7, 2020	7
Acetazolamide Capsules	Pseudotumor Cerebri	It made my headaches and vision considerably worse at a low dose (250mg b.i.d.). Caused a number of other side effects: horrible numbness and tingling on hands, feet, arms, legs and face; fatigue; loss of appetite; nausea; vomiting; diarrhea; tons of kidney stones; muscle weakness; severe muscle cramping; loss of bladder control; loss of muscle control (unable to move fingers, face twitching); loss of feeling on hands and feet; cyanosis of extremities.	1	June 1, 2020	9
Acetazolamide Capsules	Pseudotumor Cerebri	acetazolamide literally has not worked or helped my pseudotumor cerebri at all	3	May 24, 2020	7
Acetazolamide Capsules	Pseudotumor Cerebri	I have dealt with years of intracranial hypertension, which after this lockdown and putting on 'a few pounds' in such a short space of time, I came out of remission. Ended up back in hospital having a lumbar puncture once again, and my neurologist decided to put me on these tablets. I am on 3x 250mg It is safe to say I have had near all of the side effects (I am on day 6) and so far..... Lightheadedness, severe fatigue, tingling in my  fingers, feet, face, lips.. but I tend to giggle them off. I found the energy to go for a walk yesturday and today (not alone, too scared incase I get too lightheaded) the tingling intensifies. I can not drink anything fizzy, the taste is just awful! I get tiny headaches but nothing compared to what I had to deal with when going through IIH.  I thought about stopping the medication, but I will persevere for now and see how I get on for the next month.  It is lucky I am on Furlough, or there is no way I would be able to handle taking them and work.	3	May 4, 2020	10
Acetazolamide Capsules		I am using acetazolamide to help with my Ménière’s Disease. I’m only on 250 mg but need to work up to 500 mg daily. I feel like I’m in a fog and extremely tired. The pins and needles in my hands, feet and face come and go.  Is there anyone else using acetazolamide to help with Ménière’s symptoms? I can’t tell if it’s making them worse or better.	6	March 10, 2020	6
Acetazolamide Capsules	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Hydrocephalus	I had to take this medication due to me having fluid around the brain. The doctors stated I had swelling behind my eyes which caused headaches and lost of vision. This medicine was disgusted the least to say. When I started this medicine I was 177.lb I weighed 155 by the time I finished the bottle. I had no appetite, no sex drive, dry moth and could only drink water or a juice I found that I liked and could actually taste! Soda tasted like metal. I took this medicine for 4 weeks. In August I had Shunt surgery! That was one of the best decisions of my life. My vision is a lot better and I’m free to wear whatever I like! Hope you all get better soon! If you have another options other than taking this medicine by all means do so! You will be a lot happier and not miserable!!!!	3	February 12, 2020	16
Acetazolamide Capsules	Pseudotumor Cerebri	"I was diagnosed with pesudotumor cerebri in 2017 and have been on this medication for over 2 years.  Together with a healthy diet and exercise I've managed to loose about 20kg so have been slowly allowed to go off it.  My papiledema has improved significantly to the point where it is unnoticeable and I'm currently ""under observation"".  During my time on this medication I've experienced some tingling in my extremities, dry mouth and coughs, changes in the taste of certain foods and GI issues such as heartburn.   I did have to get back on it after about two months off due to taking ADHD medications who elevated my ICP, but the GI issues were so severe that my neurologist prescribed me a different medication, since my ICP is now under control.   This medication has some severe side effects, but it also works and in my case it helped save my eyesight and it's preferable to having a lumbar puncture every few months."	7	February 9, 2020	4
Acetazolamide Capsules		Man , so I just was going to my eye doctor for a check up about my left eye having pressure, having head aches but I started a green smoothie diet started feeling better. But she sent me to the ER to have an emergency cat scan as she had seen something. So I had a MRI & brain and and spinal cord because I had so much pressure on it ( Idiopathic intracranial hypertension - IIH) But I feel I could have went with out all of this including the medication I hate taking it sometimes I don't want to take it I can't eat , & I feel like I will throw up , & I feel spaced out I don't feel normal 	1	February 4, 2020	9
Acetazolamide Capsules	Glaucoma	I've been taking acetazolamide  for glaucoma for 2 weeks now and the lightheadedness, weakness and low energy level is very  troublesome. I've been given no other options, with regards to my eye pressure condition. The weakness and dizziness are like a very bad flu condition.	2	January 26, 2020	5
Acetazolamide Capsules	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Pseudotumor Cerebri	"Have been on the med for about 3 weeks.  1 pill - 125mg every night.  Did not help...I still had episodes.  Last week started 2 pills (in the a.m. and one p.m.).  While it seems (so far) to be holding off the episodes, I feel AWFUL.  Ears were already ringing and this has just turned it up.  Nausea.  General feeling of ""I just don't feel well"".  Weakness and fatigue.  Feels like I'm breathing in air but no oxygen...like I'm getting no benefit from it (does that make sense?). Slept for about 8.5-9 hours last night and still woke up completely exhausted."	5	January 14, 2020	26
Acetazolamide Capsules	Pseudotumor Cerebri	This medication acetazolamide was horrific at first!!! I had to takeoff work a month just to take it. I started taking a dose of  125mg a night for a week, then 125 x2 a day for a week, then 250 x2 a day fir a week. Now I take 500 mg ER once a day. Next week I go to 500mg  ER 2 x a day.  I was so sick I couldn’t get out of bed the first two weeks. Food and drinks still taste strange, still very sick just not as bad, but sadly trying to adjust as my new normal. Still tingling in hands/feet. Sharp headaches, nausea, breathing issues, tired, eyes look weak, dizzy, always in a haze. Eating anything seems to enhance my nausea. I had trouble walking one week and had to have a epidural steroid shot in my back. I have lived with ringing in both ears for over a year now. The medicine has made my ringing worse! I can’t stop the medicine. So I don’t have a choice. I have to take the medicine or risk going blind. However, I am pretty miserable!!!	7	January 6, 2020	11
Acetazolamide Capsules	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Glaucoma	Reduced my eye pressure after a vitrectomy. Initially made me spacey and sleepy with Pins and needles but hey small price to pray to protect my vision and lower my eye pressure from 50 to 40  and so on. Used in conjunction eye drops. I’ve only used short term. I’ve read several other side affects and have experienced the need to go urinate often.	8	December 10, 2019	6
Acetazolamide Capsules	Pseudotumor Cerebri	I take 750mg acetazolamide morning and night since 2016. I have ICP and when the fluid around my eyes, brain spinal cord is peaking the nerves in my eye was damaged and my left side would not work. I could not lift my foot or walk, my left arm was weak and my head felt like it was going to explode. Its now October 2019 and I can walk talk and process my thoughts and voice. I am working 45 hours a week and driving.  So the short answer is YES my meds are working but and just about over taking so many meds as the side effects drive me crazy.	9	October 20, 2019	4
Acetazolamide Capsules	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Pseudotumor Cerebri	Makes my feet tingle and I hear ringing in my ears all the time	5	September 4, 2019	15
Acetazolamide Capsules	Pseudotumor Cerebri	This is by far the worst medication I have ever been on. I’m a week in to taking the medication now and I’m struggling to sleep due to the pins and needles in my face and eyes. It’s just constant. I also suffer with panic disorder and my anxiety has been sky high since starting these tablets.  I recommend to anyone that if you begin these tablets then ask your GP for some propranolol to go with them.	2	September 1, 2019	6
Acetazolamide Capsules	Mountain Sickness / Altitude Sickness	I took this medication because I live at sea level and was going to the Rocky Mountains for only three days.  I knew I wouldn't have time to adjust to the altitude during such a short visit and it included a photo excursion at 10,000 feet. Took as directed before ascent and was surprised to find that it helped me sleep AND curbed my appetite.  No side effects and I was able to enjoy the mountains.  About 6 months later, took it again for another mountain visit.  Planning on taking it again in a couple of weeks for next mountain trip.	8	August 31, 2019	0
Acetazolamide Capsules	Hydrocephalus	I’m on my 5th day of this acetazolamide tablet now. for Intercranial Hypertension I made an appt at the opticians as I had been suffered with disturbed vision and dizziness for around a year. I went to the opticians where they found my optical nerves were inflamed. Went to the hospital had CT and MRI scans which were normal. Had a lumbar puncture which revealed excess fluid on my spine so they drained some out. For anyone who says that spinal taps aren’t painful, they’re lying. It was horrible. They then put me on these tablets to prevent the fluid from reproducing.  Blurred vision and dizziness seems to be my main symptom along with tingling fingers and toes. I am determined to stick this out though as I have read great things about it.	4	August 27, 2019	11
Acetazolamide Capsules	Pseudotumor Cerebri	Acetazolamide gave me breathing problems and fast heartbeat. I hyperventilate when I take it. Sometimes it would come right back up before it reached my stomach. I still had high pressure symptoms. I was very out of it all the time. I felt like I was dying on it. But I was so out of it I couldn't even communicate that. I was on it for a year the first time and a month the second and definitely the last time.	1	August 3, 2019	5
Acetazolamide Capsules	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Glaucoma	I don’t like this one bit, the first day I took it I felt like I was having a massive panic attack or I was going to go crazy, I tried to stick it out for a couple more days and take it right before I sleep and that helped but honestly it’s such a pain to eat and take it right before bed and force yourself to sleep otherwise your going to have to go to hospital... it has really red marks whenever I lean on arm, hand. Anyways I don’t like it but everyone’s different so give it a shot :)	1	August 2, 2019	4
Acetazolamide Capsules	Pseudotumor Cerebri	I was diagnosed with Pseudotumor Cerebri two months ago and I have been on Diamox for about 6 weeks. So far I have a love-hate relationship with this drug. It got rid of my “snow” almost immediately but the flashing lights and blurriness are still there. Any improvement is great in my opinion. The problem is with the side effects. I have gotten used to the weird food and beverage tastes and the tingling in my hands and feet are annoying but bearable. I have completely lost my energy. I am tired all the time and it is very difficult to find the motivation get through work and do what I need to get done. I feel like garbage a few days a week. I’m really struggling but I am going to try to learn to deal with it.	7	August 1, 2019	6
Acetazolamide Capsules	Edema	My ENT prescribed Diamox for Meniere's Disease, a build up of fluid in the inner ear. I will experience tinnitus, vertigo, ear fullness, and visual disturbances, including light sensitivity. Once starting Diamox, all of my symptoms were significantly minimized. I also struggle with migraines and noticed since taking Diamox, I have not had 1 episode. Like others, I experience diarrhea, but increasing my daily water intake has helped. I too also experience tingling in my hands and feet, but it's not intense. I just learned this medicine can suppress appetite, and this does occur with me. I also have more energy, so much, most nights I have insomnia. Has anyone else experienced this? Overall, for me the benefits certainly outweigh the costs. I've been granted a new outlook on life. Before Diamox, the Meniere's left me in a fog, both in vision and hearing. If anyone has also experienced trouble sleeping, please share what you have found to help, I would love to hear it!	8	July 4, 2019	11
Acetazolamide Capsules	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Mountain Sickness / Altitude Sickness	I took one of these pills (125mg) to try it before my vacation and I haven't felt so sick in a long time.  OMG it was horrible!!  It started with mild dizziness and tiredness.  Not so bad but by the 12th hour I just wanted to check out.  A lot of dizziness, very tired but couldn't sleep, nausea and headache.  Generally I felt awful but couldn't put my finger on how else it made me feel this awfulness.  I took a meclazine and some Advil and felt a bit better.  The next day, I still felt a bit weird but not so awful.  That stuff lasts a long time and if you take it on vacation and have my reaction, you'll waste a lot of hours being miserable.	1	July 3, 2019	3
Acetazolamide Capsules		I have suffered with migraines and severe dizziness and vertigo since I was 6. Neurologist put me on this. I've only taken it for 2 days but my headaches and dizziness are worse, I feel so tired I have double vision, excessively thirsty and tingling in face, hands and feet like pins and needles. I knew it wasn't going to work for my vertigo but was hoping I could tolerate it long enough to get the weight loss side effect, but I'd rather stay fat.	1	June 23, 2019	3
Acetazolamide Capsules	Glaucoma	I've been taking this for almost a month now at 500mg a day. Made me terribly sleepy at first and I slept almost all day on the first Sunday (4 days in), terrible abdominal pains, wooly head and nausea plus more frequent urination. Sleepiness has passed and I've been taking the tablets before a meal and that has helped with the abdominal pain. Still waking in the night to visit the loo but daytime urination has normalised. Nausea is a constant though and I have to force myself to eat. The consultant has given me another month's supply, oh joy.	6	June 20, 2019	3
Acetazolamide Capsules	Mountain Sickness / Altitude Sickness	Ok so I got these pills for altitude sickness in Peru and I got told to take one half in the morning and one half at night two days before high altitude. So I took a half when I arrived in Arequipa, around 2300m above sea level. With ONLY one small half, my hands started tingling, my whole face and me KNEES and even the upper part of my back. I couldn’t even walk correctly. Now it’s been around 27 hours I only took the half mentioned and my hands are still tingling. It is very annoying and ruined my first day in Arequipa. I won’t be taking them anymore, I prefer dealing with altitude sickness with coca gum and leaves than rather  not being able to use my body correctly. Also it’s true, you go to the bathroon all the time, so it’s no good if you are trekking and don’t have easy access to a toilet.	2	June 5, 2019	2
Acetazolamide Capsules	Hydrocephalus	I was diagnosed with Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH) a week ago and have been on the diamox for a week. It’s been a week of awfulness. Hands, feet and full face are numb and tingling. I also feel thumping in my face. I’m so tired and just sick. I’m nauseous ,major anxiety, I feel like I have the flu. I’m trying to get through this but I don’t know how much more I can take. I don’t know if there’s a different kind of medicine I can take for IIH. [if you check the internet there is an article in Medscape about Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH)]	1	May 31, 2019	12
Acetazolamide Capsules	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Mountain Sickness / Altitude Sickness	Upon arrival in Lhasa, Tibet at approx 3000 MAS(metres above sea level) I started getting a very bad head ache. Approx 8 hrs later the headache had progressed to extreme throbbing. I drank plenty of water and took diamox as prescribed by my g.p. for altitude sickness. The next day I signed myself up on tour to travel to nam tso @ approx 5000 mas..	10	May 28, 2019	6
Acetazolamide Capsules		I have been  acetazolamide drug for 3 months. My memory is foggy. I also have anxiety disorder. This medication has increased my anxiety at high dosage	2	May 14, 2019	3
Acetazolamide Capsules	Pseudotumor Cerebri	Acetazolamide isn’t fun but it does work really well for me. The headaches and vision loss I was suffering from pseudotumor cerebri were way worse than the side effects of this medicine. I haven’t noticed any of the side effects alleviating over time. I experienced my hands, mouth and feet tingling so much it hurt. It would wake me up at night and I’d have to walk around till the tingling stopped. My mood and energy have definitely been low since taking this medication. The worst side effect is probably the way food tastes, for me it is almost everything, not just carbonated beverages.	8	April 23, 2019	16
Acetazolamide Capsules	Glaucoma	Acetazolamide is great bringing down my eye pressure. I am also eating normally, but losing weight (yay), an unexpected added bonus. The first week left me feeling super down and tired, but now I feel great. In addition to the weight loss bonus my arthritis is way better. I used to hobble from stiff joints, and found it hard to lift my right arm, but not anymore! I am on 500mg twice day, and my eye pressure drops within minutes of taking it. There is a diarrhea side effect sometimes, but it isn't so bad for me. I drink a lot of water while taking this and that seems to help.	8	April 9, 2019	10
Acetazolamide Capsules	Diamox (acetazolamide)	I just started taking Acetazolamide 1/2 pill of 250 mg tab  for my   ringing in my left ear and I'm feeling tired and kind of weak I feel like going back to bed. My ENT DR prescribed this, does anyone else out there have similar problems??		March 30, 2019	8
Acetazolamide Capsules	Glaucoma	My worst side effect experience is lack of appetite and lethargy at times, now I have some diarrhea. But my eye pressure is down to 18 in one eye 13 in the left as of last check, but the loss off appetite concerns me	7	March 20, 2019	4
Acetazolamide Capsules	Pseudotumor Cerebri	My doctors had me taking 1500mg 2x a day, my headaches went away. I had problems getting the medication so I started taking 1000mg 2x a day and I was doing well, if I didn’t take any at all I would be able to go 2-3 days before getting a headache. I went about 6 months no medication and with no headaches before they started up again. I was able to get a hold of the medication but  I’m having trouble getting refills, I’ve been taking 2 pills every night and It works but I can feel them slowly coming back. I’ve been taking these pills for almost 4 years now and I’ve tried everything to take care of it, I’ve lost weight, taken headache OTC pills, coffee helps but not to get rid of them — please if anyone knows of an alternative to the medication that can help— willing to try anything at this point TBH.	10	January 27, 2019	7
Acetazolamide Capsules	Pseudotumor Cerebri	I was taking this 3x a day and it helped my ICP that began after brain surgery, but it slowly began to make me severely depressed and I didn’t realize that was the problem, until I ran out and went 2 days without it and my mood improved drastically. Not sure what to do now. Will see dr in 2 days	5	January 6, 2019	5
Acetazolamide Capsules	Pseudotumor Cerebri	I was on Diamox for about 2 months & it definitely helped. My worst side effect of it was a pressure that built on the bridge of my nose from it and my face would feel “shaky”. Hate it!	7	December 24, 2018	6
Acetazolamide Capsules	Hydrocephalus	I have Rebound Intracranial Hypertension (from Hypotension) .I was originally diagnosed with idiopathic intracranial HYPOtension (leaking spinal fluid), so I couldn't stand upright without my brain feeling like it was getting crushed.  Got a blood patch, was fixed for awhile, but now I'm one of the rare cases of now having too much spinal fluid, so my brain feels like its going to explode. I could've risked either a spinal tap (and possible lead back to the original hypotension) or go on Acetazolamide to reduce the amount of fluids in my body and my head.  Typical side effects everyone mentions here - soda tastes like garbage, and I get tingling hands/feet. I'm on one tablet of 250mg per day, and it's been able to stop the exploding headaches. I've been warned to see an optometrist to make sure the pressure isn't enough to cause optical nerve damage, but other than that, this is a working solution for me. Hoping to eventually ween myself off it.	10	December 6, 2018	12
Acetazolamide Capsules	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Mountain Sickness / Altitude Sickness	DO NOT if you have panic disorder. Had the worst panic attack of my life hours after taking it and thought I was gonna pass out and/or die. Guess I’ll just have to face the altitude sickness bc you couldn’t pay me ten trillion dollars to take this again.   FYI I think most people do not have this experience, just warning those who have bad anxiety!	1	October 19, 2018	7
Acetazolamide Capsules	Pseudotumor Cerebri	This medicine helped my migraines stop, but it caused me an insane amount of fatigued when I started it and when I stopped it. My hands, legs, feet, and sometimes other body parts tingled nonstop. Sometimes the tingle was so strong, it actually hurt. My hands tingled so much so that I couldn’t write, so I had to use my computer to take notes instead.  The one good thing from this medicine was the horrible migraines I’ve been suffering through never once occurred.	8	October 5, 2018	10
Acetazolamide Capsules	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Pseudotumor Cerebri	I had Pseudotumor Cerebri and  Papilledema (an eye condition that happens when pressure in your brain makes your optic nerve swell.) I was blind for 14 days. After taking Diamox I slowly regained my vision. I also had Gastric Bypass Surgery. This had me reduce my weight and any pressure. I am now cured.	9	October 2, 2018	65
Acetazolamide Capsules	Glaucoma	I am home from cataract surgery  have taken 3 pills. The soles of my feet were tingling with such intensity they hurt.  Did not last long, then around my mouth started tingling, feels like I ate as mango which I am highly allergic to.  Afraid to take the  last one	7	August 23, 2018	2
Acetazolamide Capsules	Pseudotumor Cerebri	I was diagnosed in 2013, I was told you have pressure headaches,  and I thought no big deal.  I stopped going to my Neuro Dr and he failed to give me the actual Dx or even tell me how serious my DX is.  I only learned I have IIH in 2018 when I requested my medical records, due to a worsening of my headaches, pulsating tinnutis, dizziness, visual disturbance, eye pain,  pressure, horrific headaches,  and feeling like I will live with a migraine like headache everyday of my life. I don't know about anyone else but when you start to think Trepanation (making a hole in your head) could be a good thing you know it is bad. I am now taking Acetazolamide again. Day 2: change in taste buds, carbonated drinks taste awful, cheese is terrible... Tingling in lips, face and hands.  Moderate stomach pain. Feelings of lethargy, decreased appetite,  generally feel unwell. My Dr advised some or all will go away.		July 6, 2018	9
Acetazolamide Capsules	Hydrocephalus	I have Chiari Malformation Type 1. (Basically, part of my brain is squeezing through the opening at the base of the skull where the spinal cord enters, and is putting pressure on the spinal cord - it's a congenital thing in almost all cases, but for me wasn't diagnosed until age 34. I have scoliosis, chronic pain, and chronic migraines all caused by the Chiari.) Was put on 125mg Diamox twice a day. So far it's reduced the severity of my migraines but not their frequency, and hasn't done anything for the pain. The tingling is the only side effect that hasn't gone away, and most of the time it doesn't bother me, but sometimes it's intense enough that I feel like I'm suffering oxygen deprivation from hyperventilating - my hands even start to go stiff. If I didn't know it was a meds side effect it'd be pretty worrying. Still, more pros than cons for me.	7	June 28, 2018	1
Acetazolamide Capsules	Glaucoma	I took this medicine once and the side effects are horrible. It decreases my potassium to the point that I felt the pressure on my head and it feels like I was about to collapse. My whole body started to feel numb and I was shaking and scared. (I was about to panic when I felt that numbness all over my body ) but I stayed calm and rested but I can still feel the tingling sensation. I pee a lot , dizziness and I feel like it triggers my anxiety.   But this medicine helped my eye pressure. I just took this once  and I will never take that again. Earlier I went to my opthamologist and he is kind of shocked that I said I was about to collapse and he said that don't take that medicine because of the side effects.  Right now I can still feel the tingling in my fingers and foot.  Ijust ate banana and it helps...	3	June 22, 2018	5
Acetazolamide Capsules	Pseudotumor Cerebri	I felt horrible for the first two weeks after being diagnosed with  pseudotumor cerbri, and taking the medicine 1000mg a day. The tingling in my hands face and toes comes and goes. I have had no more headaches or pressure in my sinuses since the first few weeks of starting it.	6	April 20, 2018	6
Acetazolamide Capsules	Glaucoma	I was diagnosed with intermediate uveitis 5 weeks ago and recently started on Diamox 2 weeks ago after my eye pressure started increasing from the steroid drops I am on. The first couple days I was much more tired and almost foggy minded. Also had to urinate much more often. Than after the first couple days, my body got very used to it. The only main symptom I have now is light tingling in my feet. My eye pressure was down from 39 to 28 in a weeks time.		April 7, 2018	7
Acetazolamide Capsules	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Edema	I was given diamox to treat bilateral ringing in the ears, headaches and pressure behind my eyes. I am 39 years old and I have lived with ringing in my ears all of my life. I have tried every available option out there to treat tinnitus and nothing has worked. I was referred to a new specialist dealing with ear diseases and he asked me a few questions and then prescribed diamox. Within 2 hours of taking diamox the ringing in my ears stopped completely and the pressure behind my eyes went away as well as headaches I've dealt with for years. I was shocked that this medicine is working as one of the side effects was ringing in the ears but I am having the opposite effect.	10	April 5, 2018	16
Acetazolamide Capsules	Glaucoma	This is the third time taking acetazolamide.  The main side effect for me is the eggy taste inmy mouth, constant loose bowels, numbness in my hands and feet and face, feeling cold, tired and week. think I've tried almost every eye drop on the market and pressures are still over 40.  I'm on this medication for 2 months four times a day.  My operation is on 3/5/18 really hoping the side effects ease off soon it's beginning to get me down.	6	March 19, 2018	4
Acetazolamide Capsules	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Glaucoma	Its a good medicine to decrease the Eye pressure.  While taking this tab - depression and dark thoughts are more and I have no interest in food, and also my  hands tickle like they are  in water.  Now I've stopped the medicine, my eye pressure become normal and constant. After stopping the medicine it takes a few  days  to decrease all the worst symptoms.   	8	February 17, 2018	13
Acetazolamide Capsules	Hydrocephalus	I am currently on this medication 500mg 2x's a day to treat the excess fluid gain on my brain that causes seizures. The first dose of this medication I instantly had a really bad taste for soda and for most anything that I ate or drank. I experienced extreme tiredness dizziness headaches and had a decrease in appetite. After about 2 days I noticed numbness and tingling in my hands and feet ringing in my ears a stabbing pressure pain in my eyes and abdominal pain I had to pee every 20-30 min and had extreme diarrhea instantly after every meal, all my bowel movements are diarrhea. After telling my neurologist about it he said they are common and to take once a day for 2 weeks to let my body adjust then back to 2x's. I fluctuate back and forth with the once and twice a day because he will not let me stop taking it and all of the affects still remain after 8 months of treatment but it has decreased the fluid levels on my brain and I lost 30 pounds are the only benefits	3	February 13, 2018	7
Acetazolamide Capsules	Pseudotumor Cerebri	I have been on Diamox for 3 weeks. I continue to have severe headaches still same pressure on my eyes and head. I can not stay awake taking this medicine. I get up and try to sit on couch and within 5 min I’m out. I see a Neurosurgeon in 3 days and I hope he can help me. I can’t even walk properly because my balance is so off. My wife is typing this as I speak.	1	February 5, 2018	6
Acetazolamide Capsules	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Pseudotumor Cerebri	I am 18 years old and I was diagnosed with pseudotumor cerebri after an allergic reaction to long term use of tetracyclines for acne. I went to the ER twice experiencing persistent, debilitating migraines, double vision, and one eye turned to face inward towards my nose, and they were unable to relieve any of it. My eye doctor, after a month of different testing, diagnosed me with pseudotumor cerebri and a neurologist started me on diamox and within two weeks my eye turned straight again, and the headaches and double vision were gone. I experienced the common tingling in my hands and feet, difficulty drinking carbonated beverages, small rashes, and lethargy from diamox, but it was all bearable after a week and within a month I am fixed.	10	December 19, 2017	39
Acetazolamide Capsules	Pseudotumor Cerebri	All I have to say is that this pill has made my life so much better. Three years ago this pseudotumor cerebri started after having my first born. I was at my heaviest at 245lb pounds. Ever since I've never been the same until now although I deal with the side effects (sleepy, muscle weakness , tiredness, tingling ) being sleepy has been the worst to cope with because I'm a mother and I have things to do BUT at least some days I'm able to function well and that's better than nothing. I also take Potassium which helps a lot for the tingling !!! I hope one day I no longer have to take these pills and finally have my life back and enjoy it ! BTW I'm 21 yrs old	6	December 18, 2017	8
Acetazolamide Capsules	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Pseudotumor Cerebri	I have been on Diamox since 2004 when I was first diagnosed with a pseudotumor cerebri. I was hospitalized for 5 days after experiencing paralysis in my legs, severe headaches, nausea and visual impairment.  I have tried to stop taking the medication but had to return to it due to the severe headaches and cranial swelling.  I have constant problems with electrolyte deficiencies and have to take additional medications to alleviate other problems.  This is still the best treatment I have experienced.  In addition to this condition, I also have Lupus, HBP, Hypothyroidism and I am Bi-polar.	9	December 4, 2017	26
Acetazolamide Capsules	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Pseudotumor Cerebri	Side effects far worse than  Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH) it's self. Constantly nauseous, made no difference to headaches/pressure, suffered with slight breathing difficulties & palpitations, the tingling in hands and feet were more like cramp than tingling in the end... the list goes on..	1	November 12, 2017	20
Acetazolamide Capsules	Glaucoma	My eye pressure was up in the 40s and Dr. gave me 1 pill only to help get it down. About 20 mins later I started  feeling numbness all over my legs, arms, nose and upper lip. It was annoying but not painful. I was needing to pee very often and was super low energy the rest of the day. Glad I only had to take the 1 pill. It  only slightly helped the eye  pressure issue.	5	September 20, 2017	4
Acetazolamide Capsules	Glaucoma	For lowering pressure the medication is very effective, however the side effects are a nightmare. I get tingling sensations everywhere, dehydration, increased urine, drowsiness. It doesn't help that I'm also a teenager who needs to concentrate on my studies so it's a miracle I managed to get through school recently.	5	September 3, 2017	6
Acetazolamide Capsules	Pseudotumor Cerebri	I was diagnosed with Pseudotumor Cerebri in February 2015. When I got pregnant with my son I gained over 60lbs. I had him in May 2014 and didn't have any symptoms until October 2014 when my eyesight went out for a second or two and it didn't happen again. I didn't pay it any mind until in January 2015 it started getting worse. My vision would go in and out for about 2-5 seconds at a time. I finally seen the ophthalmologist who said my optic nerves were swollen & referred me to a neurologist who had me do an MRI, 1 spinal tap (where my pressure was so high at 44, so they relieved some of the spinal fluid down to 20), then they finally decided to put me on Acetazolamide 500mg ER. The only cons were the metallic taste and tingling.	9	July 17, 2017	14
Acetazolamide Capsules	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Pseudotumor Cerebri	Works amazingly!	10	June 24, 2017	19
Acetazolamide Capsules	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Mountain Sickness / Altitude Sickness	Anyone planning to take this medication for altitude sickness prophylaxis, I recommend you do a trial run at home first. I took this medication to hike the inca trail and started it the day before flying to Cusco. I developed a rare side effect of blurred vision/myopia which came on about an hour after the second dose of diamox. The myopia lasted for 72 hours after ceasing the medication. It almost ruined my trip but fortunately vision returned just in time to start the hike. I went on dexamethasone after that for prophylaxis. No side effects but unfortunately the Dex didn't work as I got altitude sickness.........but that's another story!		June 23, 2017	16
Acetazolamide Capsules	Pseudotumor Cerebri	My experience with acetazolamide has been okay. I started taking it after my lumbar puncture to relieve the pressure.  (I got IIH because it was a rare side effect of an antibiotic I was on for my acne, minocycline) it has been VERY effective at relieving the pressure, but gives really annoying side effects, like tingling of my fingers, face, and toes. Like when I'm trying to sleep my feet tingle and go crazy and it makes it impossible to sleep. It also made me have little to no appetite and I have lost 20 pounds in about 2 months. I my neurologist told me that long term use of this medication can cause kidney damage, but 6 months to a year shouldn't be a worry. (I am only going to be on diamox for 6 months. I've been on it for 4 months)	7	June 23, 2017	8
Acetazolamide Capsules	Pseudotumor Cerebri	I was just recently diagnosed with high intracranial pressure with no papilledema and a huge blind spot I my left eye. I was told that a spinal tap would only cause a leak since I have a connective tissue disorder. I got an MRI and CT and everyone said they were normal excect for Dr. Driscoll. She started me on diamox and it has done wonders!!! I can see at dark now and I don't have constant eye pain/pressure, neck pain or problems sleeping. I have to sleep with a soft cervical collar and had to raise the head of my bed to make sure the fluid continues to drain even when sleeping. I do have numbness and tingling but it's more amusing to me than painful. It is difficult to keep your CO2 levels at 22 but use alkaline h20	8	June 17, 2017	7
Acetazolamide Capsules	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Pseudotumor Cerebri	Confusion, lethargy, diarrhea, hyperchloremia, CO2 16, nausea, dizziness	1	June 2, 2017	10
Acetazolamide Capsules	Pseudotumor Cerebri	"I was 19 when I was sent from my small town & county to have tests done. I'd had symptoms from age 12 when I was put on birth control pills for PCOS. The Dr from San Francisco put me on Diamox and prednisone and ordered my family Dr do a spinal tap when I had eye problems or severe headaches (he did at least 3/wk for 2yrs). My family Dr took me off the prednisone after a few months and I gained over 100lbs. The Diamox caused me weird side effects. My face was all ""tingling"", everything I ate or drank tasted metallic (especially if it was fruit or carbonated). Eventually the tingling started down my neck, chest, and hands/arms. So my Dr took me off it, gave me hydroclorathazide (it maybe misspelt). I've learned Diamox causes it a lot."	2	April 18, 2017	2
Acetazolamide Capsules	Pseudotumor Cerebri	I'm 28 and I was diagnosed with  Pseudotumor  a little over two years now I've had a VP shunt an LP shunt  and multiple lumbar punctures,  I've been taking  Acetazolmide  and I've had no side effects so far...  but I'm still having really bad headache's and swelling of my eyeballs,  so yesterday my neurologist decided that instead of taking two  pills in the morning and two pills at night,  I'll start taking three pills in the morning and three pills at night.  I just want to feel better!	10	March 19, 2017	3
Acetazolamide Capsules	Pseudotumor Cerebri	I've been taking this medication regularly for the past month and want to cry.  I'm 20 years old, a healthy female, and was diagnosed with pseudotumor cerebri.  I call my mom nearly everyday complaining of a new pain.  From the horrible tingly sensation in my hands and feet, to the horrible confusion, and now extreme pain in my abdomen, I'm ready for this all to stop.  I'm on 500 mg/daily and can't even operate my vehicle!  I am always so out of it it makes finished my homework assignments difficult let alone to constant new pains I always complain about.  I am pretty tough but when it comes to seeing my doctor every week due to the side effects of this medication, it's not worth it.	1	March 6, 2017	12
Acetazolamide Capsules	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Pseudotumor Cerebri	Hello. I am 18 and I have diagnosed with Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) December of 2016. As we all thought, I had a concussion because I played volleyball but it didn't quite flow with the big blind spot in my left eye and the perfect MRI and MRE scan results. Well, as my opening pressure from an LP was 49.7, more than half for my age, and being the first patient for my pediatrician, I have Psuedo Tumor Cerebri. My new neurologists put me on 2,000mg a day. Yes, this caused severe abdominal and GI upset for almost the first month I was taking it and a little bit here and there. My ophthalmologist has seen an improvement. My second LP as of 1/30/17 had an opening pressure of 28.7. They drained me to normal and took 10cc of instead of 8. I hope it keeps working.	8	February 19, 2017	22
Acetazolamide Capsules	Pseudotumor Cerebri	I just started acetazolemide a few days ago.  500mg 2x a day.  I had an lumbar puncture 2 days ago and neither have relieved much of the pressure.  Every time I take one of these pills I get a new symptom.  My kidney function has been weaker.  The pressure in my head continues.  My body aches all over.  The yucky taste....that is the least of my worries.  Pins and needles...check.  Extremely tired and feel like I've been beat.  I feel like bricks are laying inside my hips.  This stuff sucks!!	1	February 19, 2017	11
Acetazolamide Capsules	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Mountain Sickness / Altitude Sickness	After several bird tours flirting with 10,000 - 11,000 ft elevation I became suspicious that I was  susceptible to alt. sickness.  A redirected flight to LaPaz, Bolivia (and some unscheduled ascents near Cochabamba) convinced me I was.  Typically I serve as a human altimeter, within minutes of reaching 11,000 ft I'm puking my guts out.  Diamox has been a wonder drug in preventing alt. sickness on tours I've been on since Bolivia.  I've travelled from 8,000 ft straight to 14,000 ft several times with no alt. sickness symptoms at all.  125 mg before bed is all I need.  Tingling and bad tasting soda symptoms are greatly reduced at that dosage compared to the 250mg I initially used.	10	February 15, 2017	10
Acetazolamide Capsules	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Pseudotumor Cerebri	Diamox changed my life I had 24/7 pressure headache for 7 years of my life I went everywhere even to the mayo clinic and had test after test and scan after scan and finally my local neurologist tried this medication and it has made me able to live again for the first time in 7 years! I was diagnosed with chronic daily headache and told I would never get better but to everyone suffering there is hope don't believe what a few drs say keep searching for answers. Try this medication if nothing else has worked for you!	8	February 11, 2017	29
Acetazolamide Tablets	Pseudotumor Cerebri	I have been diagnosed with IIH (Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension) they put me on diamox. I am a rarer case because I am a thin woman compared to most. They hoped the diamox will help bring down the fluid. I started on 250mg twice daily. Anything carbonated tasted dull and metallic. My ENTIRE body will tingle and go numb but at different times throughout the day multiple times. The WORST experience for me is I am peeing all the time and my face is also breaking out, and my hands are numb and tingling for HOURS throughout the day. Overall the pins/needles in my feet up to my knees are so PAINFUL. It feels like glass/knives and this is no exaggeration. I am left in tears and it happens many times a day on each leg and I wake up out of my sleep several times a night. My nuero said it gets better over a span of 2-3 months and now it has been 5 months. He upped my dose and I am absolutely miserable .My neuro says I can not stop unless surgery because it will lead to permanent vision loss.	1	April 11, 2021	3
Acetazolamide Tablets	Pseudotumor Cerebri	I've been taking this medication for about a month so far. My opening pressure was 36 but I also was throwing up and croppy flopping from anxiety attack with needle in my back and that caused me to be laid up for 2 months alone. When I first started this medication it was miserable to say the least. I had tingles in hands feet and face, felt nauseous and weak, lightheaded, had chest pain also skin peeling. Most of it went away after 2 weeks with a little help of lemonade for nausea and walks as much as I could.  I went to see my nueroptomoplogist and in 18 days I'm done, my swelling is gone and my eye sight is wonderful. It definitely is a struggle to get on this band wagon of a med but it works I can vouch for that. Just remember  lots of potassium and proteins really help to. Hope this helps for others there is a light in the tunnel and there are other medications if this isn't a suitable one for you. Shunt should be last option due to all the risk factors that happens with it.	10	April 4, 2021	2
Acetazolamide Tablets	Glaucoma	First of all oh my god the taste of soda is god awful it started the first day I was on it I'm on day 14 I get the tingle in my finger tips I feel nausea and a bit dizzy but then it goes away and comes back. Last but not least the most explosive diarrhea I have ever experienced in my life and I had really bad stomach bug the diarrhea from this stuff is so much crazier.  The bowel sounds and stomach and intenstine gurgles are insane they're so loud as soon as I hear them I have to go destroy the toilet bowl with my diarrhea all over it. Oh my god it does help with eye pressure tho I will say that but oh my god I wish I knew how to get rid of these side effects	3	April 2, 2021	0
Acetazolamide Tablets	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Hydrocephalus	At first I was diagnosed with idiopathic intracranial hypotension (IIH) by some Neuro.  But I was on mega doses at that time.  Lost all muscles and any weight that I had.   I was 24.  Weighed in 190 male 6 foot 1.  So good build and a good weight. Not no fat like they say that it always causes or vi versa .  Or etc.  Never had a seizure until that med.  I had other problems when 16 years old etc.  But was a lot better from 18 on up.    But the only reason to go was a headache, it was crippling headache  that kept me in the bed almost all the time   and I seen neuro surgeon.     Went from IIH  to constructed hydrocephalus.   To the next shunt  I lost 5 to ten years I don't remember at all.  Went crossed eyed.  With just one eye.      When I was 24-27.   Had 20-20.    That happen.         I couldn't see anything.       Everything was seeing 2 or 3 of something.   Went on for a year.      Ok.  I'm done.   Have had 7 or 8 surgeries in 4 years etc.  Not counting eye.	4	March 20, 2021	0
Acetazolamide Tablets	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Mountain Sickness / Altitude Sickness	Absolute game changer for skiing at high altitude, I thought I would inevitably spend the first few days sick and anxious from being out of breath. I did have some Dizziness and pins and needles “electric feeling”, but this side effect was worth feeling so much better and enjoying my holiday.	9	December 28, 2020	0
Acetazolamide Tablets	Pseudotumor Cerebri	I am taking acetazolamide 500mg twice daily for pseudo tumor cerebri. I had to have a lumbar puncture to relieve the pressure. My neurologist says that I need to plan to take this med for at least 2 years.  You can’t drink soda when you’re on this medication. It tastes like acid burning your tongue and throat if you try to drink it. When I first started this, I had terrible tingling in my face, lips and the top of my head. Now it is rare for me to experience this. I experience tingly fingers multiple times daily. I have tingling and uncomfortable feet at least once or twice daily. It’s not necessarily numb - it’s an uncomfortable pins and needles feeling.   No one else has stated this but I feel like I have to urinate all of the time, but when I pee it feels like I can’t go all of the way. Like I’m unable to empty my bladder. Overall the medication does what it is supposed to and the fluid and pressure has decreased dramatically in just 5 months. I hate the side effects however.	10	December 15, 2020	18
Acetazolamide Tablets	Pseudotumor Cerebri	I have just used it for 1year but there's no change.	4	November 1, 2020	2
Acetazolamide Tablets	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Pseudotumor Cerebri	I got meningitis and and I thankfully I healed. I told my doctors several times my vision is not good, I can not see very well. I have double vision. But I didn’t have any chance to see an eye doctor in the hospital. I was discharged  from hospital with my vision problem. So I decided to go an eye doctor. Eye doctor saw that Papilledema back of my eye and it  was scary because he told me this is emergency you can be blind. I just scared. And he was great doctor he told me they will probably give you diamox if it wouldn’t work they will put a shunt. And I went to the hospital they told me the same thing. And they start giving me diamox 500 mg in the morning 500 mg in the night 2 doses in a day. I used for 5 months and it worked. I cured thanks God. But I lost weight also for helping this situation. I lost 20 kg in 5 months. I was 100 kgs now I am 80 kgs. Definitely respect this medicine take your medicine on time. Don’t use and alcohol. Stay healthy. God bless you all.	10	October 13, 2020	13
Acetazolamide Tablets	Pseudotumor Cerebri	I have been on diamox since July 2019. I take it to treat my idiopathic intracranial hypertension. I was getting really bad headaches and my my vision was blacking out. I started on 250 mg once in the morning and once at night. I noticed almost immediately that my vision wasn’t blacking out anymore. I was still getting headaches, which I did t think was going to go away because I have been getting migraines since I was 7 years old. At first the side effects were very prominent. My hands and feet would tingle all the time and go numb. I was always hearing a loud swooshing sound following by a ringing in my ears. It has been over a year since I started taking diamox and now I take 1000 mg once in the morning and once at night. I still deal with migraines but the pressure in my eyes has decreased significantly. My feet still tingle sometimes and the ringing in my ears still happens. I would rather deal with those two things than lose my vision multiple times a day.	9	September 21, 2020	6
Acetazolamide Tablets	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Pseudotumor Cerebri	I was diagnosed with pseudotumor cerebri. Lets start off with for about 3 years I have had the worst pressure headache every single day.  One day I noticed I had a new pulsating wooshing sound with my headache. I was vomiting. The next day I went to the store and noticed I couldn't see anything around me. It slowly started to get worse. One day I woke up and could not see at all. They immediately did exams , CT scans and an MRI. I also seen and specialist ophthalmologist who instantly seen how swollen my optic nerves were and suggested I be admitted for a lumbar puncture. My opening pressure was 54. They drained it to 15. Its almost been a month and I have only had 1 head ache. My vision came back but still is not 100% at all. Right now I am on 1,000 MG's of diamox twice a day. I have no complaints about it yet other then tingling in my feet and constant urination. Just make sure you drink lots of water and take a potassium supplement. I'm being seen by neuro ophthalmology once a week.	10	September 18, 2020	10
Acetazolamide Tablets	Pseudotumor Cerebri	Acetazolamide is fantastic for pseudotumor cerebri ! Fast relief from the cacophony of noises in my head, that headache I thought I didn't have because I was so used to it went away, what I thought was sciatica that never let up disappeared, and my neck and shoulders felt like they got a massage. I had to get a spinal tap first and that's when the noise let up. It took a few days for the other things to go, but what a blessing! I felt the horrible side effects as I was leaving the hospital, but I knew what to do. Research.  A few notes in case you need help with the side effects of acetazolamide: most medications take something from you in return for what they do. In this case, it's folate. I strongly suggest any time you take this or any kind of psychotropic medication, take a good quality B Complex vitamin. This one also takes electrolytes. Emergen-C is a good way to help that. And drink a lot of water!   I'm still losing weight and it's not all water anymore embrace the side effects that can help. Strong 10 out of 10 for Acetazolamide!	10	September 2, 2020	1
Acetazolamide Tablets	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Mountain Sickness / Altitude Sickness	Diamox is freaking MAGIC.  I used to get horrible, debilitating headaches at altitude in Breckenridge and Crested Butte.  And if I had a beer, well, it was so much worse. I told my doctor, an avid skier, about it and he prescribed Diamox/acetazolamide.  Game changer.  Not that I condone this, but I could hang with the 20-somethings in the bar 'til closing  and wake in the AM feeling great and ready to go.  Since then I don't go about 8000 feet without following the protocol.	10	August 30, 2020	5
Acetazolamide Tablets	Pseudotumor Cerebri	I started on acetazolamide for psuedotumor and was originally put on 1000mg a day, 500mg am and 500mg PM. I was getting really awful headaches so my dr took me down to 250mg in the am and 250mg in the PM for a week. After that week I went back up to 500mg in the am and 500mg in the pm. The side effect symptoms I have was everything carbonated tasted like metal, so I can only drink water, tea and juice. My hands, feet and lips tingle like the same tingling when your feet fall asleep. Its annoying but it doesn't affect my grip and it's not painful. I also pee all the time and I'm dealing with some acid reflux. But it is not too bad. My pain before this medicine is almost completely gone! I was scared to start this medicine after reading all the awful reviews, but now, I'm thankful I started it!	10	July 27, 2020	4

Acetazolamide Tablets	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Pseudotumor Cerebri	I am 50 years old with a BMI of 28.9. I was suffering from a headache for 3 month.

Acetazolamide Tablets	Hydrocephalus	I have been taking This since 2002 which is 28 years, I have never had luck with generics. Every generic I have taken doesn’t take all the pressure out of my head. There is only one generic that has worked for me and that is By Zydus Pharmaceuticals. Now there are two other generics besides this one that do absolutely nothing for the fluid pain my head. But this particular one works like half way. I will feel somewhat okay for about an hour a day and then late at nite I might get another hour where my head feels good. From what I have read my understanding is these companies who are making the generics are using different inactive ingredients which make my body not absorb medication as fast as the fluid is filling. I haven’t worked in almost a year. I’m always sick. I’m tired of it! Generics should be exactly like the brand! When I used to take TEVA Diamox I never had any issues. My life was fine I was working and living. Now I’m on generic living a terrible quality of life !	3	June 28, 2020	4
Acetazolamide Tablets	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Pseudotumor Cerebri	So I just found out I have IH due to there is a golf ball sized tumor in the vascular sinus of my brain. From the MRV it shows stretching and scaring on the opposite side they believe in December/January when the headaches got so bad is when that happened. I received the results two Fridays ago. This Diamos is killing me my kidneys hurt my urine is coffee colored and smell weird. I know TMI. The nuerologist nurse practitioner keeps telling me it's. Normal side effects however I haven't eaten in 5 days and if I take a drink I better be VERY near to the potty. This drug is killing me I'm sure. And I'm still in pain still hear things cry always going crazy but my vision does not have black stripes and no peripheral vision.	1	June 21, 2020	7
Acetazolamide Tablets	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Mountain Sickness / Altitude Sickness	At age 37, I decided to take my 1st ever mountain camping trip. We found a beautiful spot at 12,497 Ft. I had been to Denver as a teenager with no reaction to altitude so I wasn’t expecting to get sick. I hydrated, but evidently not enough. Within 4 hours of making camp, I began feeling nauseous. After 6 hours, diarrhea. By 10 hours, around midnight, I was going in and out of consciousness. We thought I had severe food poisoning. Due to the dangerous location, we could not get down from the mountain. Long story short, when I returned home to Dallas Texas, I had had a mild edema. My doctor prescribed Diamox and portable oxygen for my next mountain trip. It really gets the job done. I have played around with the dosing starting at half doses &add more up to the full dose as needed. I begin Diamox 48 hours before ascending over 9.5k. I find smaller dosing decreases the drowsiness.  I hope this information helps others. Be safe and well.	10	June 11, 2020	8
Acetazolamide Tablets	Glaucoma	I was only prescribed this medication for 3 days following an eye procedure , I generally steer away from any prescription meds as much as possible.  I experienced horrible tingling hands and feet /  mild nausea , a little light headed,  the worst symptom was extreme fatigue,   Very relieved when the 3 day course was up.	3	June 7, 2020	7
Acetazolamide Tablets	Pseudotumor Cerebri	It made my headaches and vision considerably worse at a low dose (250mg b.i.d.).

Acetazolamide Tablets	Pseudotumor Cerebri	I have dealt with years of intracranial hypertension, which after this lockdown and putting on 'a few pounds' in such a short space of time, I came out of remission. Ended up back in hospital having a lumbar puncture once again, and my neurologist decided to put me on these tablets. I am on 3x 250mg It is safe to say I have had near all of the side effects (I am on day 6) and so far..... Lightheadedness, severe fatigue, tingling in my  fingers, feet, face, lips.. but I tend to giggle them off. I found the energy to go for a walk yesturday and today (not alone, too scared incase I get too lightheaded) the tingling intensifies. I can not drink anything fizzy, the taste is just awful! I get tiny headaches but nothing compared to what I had to deal with when going through IIH.  I thought about stopping the medication, but I will persevere for now and see how I get on for the next month.  It is lucky I am on Furlough, or there is no way I would be able to handle taking them and work.	3	May 4, 2020	10
Acetazolamide Tablets		I am using acetazolamide to help with my Ménière’s Disease. I’m only on 250 mg but need to work up to 500 mg daily. I feel like I’m in a fog and extremely tired. The pins and needles in my hands, feet and face come and go.  Is there anyone else using acetazolamide to help with Ménière’s symptoms? I can’t tell if it’s making them worse or better.	6	March 10, 2020	6
Acetazolamide Tablets	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Hydrocephalus	I had to take this medication due to me having fluid around the brain. The doctors stated I had swelling behind my eyes which caused headaches and lost of vision. This medicine was disgusted the least to say. When I started this medicine I was 177.lb I weighed 155 by the time I finished the bottle. I had no appetite, no sex drive, dry moth and could only drink water or a juice I found that I liked and could actually taste! Soda tasted like metal. I took this medicine for 4 weeks. In August I had Shunt surgery! That was one of the best decisions of my life. My vision is a lot better and I’m free to wear whatever I like! Hope you all get better soon! If you have another options other than taking this medicine by all means do so! You will be a lot happier and not miserable!!!!	3	February 12, 2020	16
Acetazolamide Tablets	Pseudotumor Cerebri	"I was diagnosed with pesudotumor cerebri in 2017 and have been on this medication for over 2 years.  Together with a healthy diet and exercise I've managed to loose about 20kg so have been slowly allowed to go off it.  My papiledema has improved significantly to the point where it is unnoticeable and I'm currently ""under observation"".  During my time on this medication I've experienced some tingling in my extremities, dry mouth and coughs, changes in the taste of certain foods and GI issues such as heartburn.   I did have to get back on it after about two months off due to taking ADHD medications who elevated my ICP, but the GI issues were so severe that my neurologist prescribed me a different medication, since my ICP is now under control.   This medication has some severe side effects, but it also works and in my case it helped save my eyesight and it's preferable to having a lumbar puncture every few months."	7	February 9, 2020	4
Acetazolamide Tablets		Man , so I just was going to my eye doctor for a check up about my left eye having pressure, having head aches but I started a green smoothie diet started feeling better. But she sent me to the ER to have an emergency cat scan as she had seen something. So I had a MRI & brain and and spinal cord because I had so much pressure on it ( Idiopathic intracranial hypertension - IIH) But I feel I could have went with out all of this including the medication I hate taking it sometimes I don't want to take it I can't eat , & I feel like I will throw up , & I feel spaced out I don't feel normal 	1	February 4, 2020	9
Acetazolamide Tablets	Glaucoma	I've been taking acetazolamide  for glaucoma for 2 weeks now and the lightheadedness, weakness and low energy level is very  troublesome. I've been given no other options, with regards to my eye pressure condition. The weakness and dizziness are like a very bad flu condition.	2	January 26, 2020	5
Acetazolamide Tablets	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Pseudotumor Cerebri	"Have been on the med for about 3 weeks.  1 pill - 125mg every night.  Did not help...I still had episodes.  Last week started 2 pills (in the a.m. and one p.m.).  While it seems (so far) to be holding off the episodes, I feel AWFUL.  Ears were already ringing and this has just turned it up.  Nausea.  General feeling of ""I just don't feel well"".  Weakness and fatigue.  Feels like I'm breathing in air but no oxygen...like I'm getting no benefit from it (does that make sense?). Slept for about 8.5-9 hours last night and still woke up completely exhausted."	5	January 14, 2020	26
Acetazolamide Tablets	Pseudotumor Cerebri	This medication acetazolamide was horrific at first!!! I had to takeoff work a month just to take it. I started taking a dose of  125mg a night for a week, then 125 x2 a day for a week, then 250 x2 a day fir a week. Now I take 500 mg ER once a day. Next week I go to 500mg  ER 2 x a day.  I was so sick I couldn’t get out of bed the first two weeks. Food and drinks still taste strange, still very sick just not as bad, but sadly trying to adjust as my new normal. Still tingling in hands/feet. Sharp headaches, nausea, breathing issues, tired, eyes look weak, dizzy, always in a haze. Eating anything seems to enhance my nausea. I had trouble walking one week and had to have a epidural steroid shot in my back. I have lived with ringing in both ears for over a year now. The medicine has made my ringing worse! I can’t stop the medicine. So I don’t have a choice. I have to take the medicine or risk going blind. However, I am pretty miserable!!!	7	January 6, 2020	11
Acetazolamide Tablets	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Glaucoma	Reduced my eye pressure after a vitrectomy. Initially made me spacey and sleepy with Pins and needles but hey small price to pray to protect my vision and lower my eye pressure from 50 to 40  and so on. Used in conjunction eye drops. I’ve only used short term. I’ve read several other side affects and have experienced the need to go urinate often.	8	December 10, 2019	6
Acetazolamide Tablets	Pseudotumor Cerebri	I take 750mg acetazolamide morning and night since 2016. I have ICP and when the fluid around my eyes, brain spinal cord is peaking the nerves in my eye was damaged and my left side would not work. I could not lift my foot or walk, my left arm was weak and my head felt like it was going to explode. Its now October 2019 and I can walk talk and process my thoughts and voice. I am working 45 hours a week and driving.  So the short answer is YES my meds are working but and just about over taking so many meds as the side effects drive me crazy.	9	October 20, 2019	4
Acetazolamide Tablets	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Pseudotumor Cerebri	Makes my feet tingle and I hear ringing in my ears all the time	5	September 4, 2019	15
Acetazolamide Tablets	Pseudotumor Cerebri	This is by far the worst medication I have ever been on. I’m a week in to taking the medication now and I’m struggling to sleep due to the pins and needles in my face and eyes. It’s just constant. I also suffer with panic disorder and my anxiety has been sky high since starting these tablets.  I recommend to anyone that if you begin these tablets then ask your GP for some propranolol to go with them.	2	September 1, 2019	6
Acetazolamide Tablets	Mountain Sickness / Altitude Sickness	I took this medication because I live at sea level and was going to the Rocky Mountains for only three days.  I knew I wouldn't have time to adjust to the altitude during such a short visit and it included a photo excursion at 10,000 feet. Took as directed before ascent and was surprised to find that it helped me sleep AND curbed my appetite.  No side effects and I was able to enjoy the mountains.  About 6 months later, took it again for another mountain visit.  Planning on taking it again in a couple of weeks for next mountain trip.	8	August 31, 2019	0
Acetazolamide Tablets	Hydrocephalus	I’m on my 5th day of this acetazolamide tablet now. for Intercranial Hypertension I made an appt at the opticians as I had been suffered with disturbed vision and dizziness for around a year. I went to the opticians where they found my optical nerves were inflamed. Went to the hospital had CT and MRI scans which were normal. Had a lumbar puncture which revealed excess fluid on my spine so they drained some out. For anyone who says that spinal taps aren’t painful, they’re lying. It was horrible. They then put me on these tablets to prevent the fluid from reproducing.  Blurred vision and dizziness seems to be my main symptom along with tingling fingers and toes. I am determined to stick this out though as I have read great things about it.	4	August 27, 2019	11
Acetazolamide Tablets	Pseudotumor Cerebri	Acetazolamide gave me breathing problems and fast heartbeat. I hyperventilate when I take it. Sometimes it would come right back up before it reached my stomach. I still had high pressure symptoms. I was very out of it all the time. I felt like I was dying on it. But I was so out of it I couldn't even communicate that. I was on it for a year the first time and a month the second and definitely the last time.	1	August 3, 2019	5
Acetazolamide Tablets	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Glaucoma	I don’t like this one bit, the first day I took it I felt like I was having a massive panic attack or I was going to go crazy, I tried to stick it out for a couple more days and take it right before I sleep and that helped but honestly it’s such a pain to eat and take it right before bed and force yourself to sleep otherwise your going to have to go to hospital... it has really red marks whenever I lean on arm, hand. Anyways I don’t like it but everyone’s different so give it a shot :)	1	August 2, 2019	4
Acetazolamide Tablets	Pseudotumor Cerebri	I was diagnosed with Pseudotumor Cerebri two months ago and I have been on Diamox for about 6 weeks. So far I have a love-hate relationship with this drug. It got rid of my “snow” almost immediately but the flashing lights and blurriness are still there. Any improvement is great in my opinion. The problem is with the side effects. I have gotten used to the weird food and beverage tastes and the tingling in my hands and feet are annoying but bearable. I have completely lost my energy. I am tired all the time and it is very difficult to find the motivation get through work and do what I need to get done. I feel like garbage a few days a week. I’m really struggling but I am going to try to learn to deal with it.	7	August 1, 2019	6
Acetazolamide Tablets	Edema	My ENT prescribed Diamox for Meniere's Disease, a build up of fluid in the inner ear. I will experience tinnitus, vertigo, ear fullness, and visual disturbances, including light sensitivity. Once starting Diamox, all of my symptoms were significantly minimized. I also struggle with migraines and noticed since taking Diamox, I have not had 1 episode. Like others, I experience diarrhea, but increasing my daily water intake has helped. I too also experience tingling in my hands and feet, but it's not intense. I just learned this medicine can suppress appetite, and this does occur with me. I also have more energy, so much, most nights I have insomnia. Has anyone else experienced this? Overall, for me the benefits certainly outweigh the costs. I've been granted a new outlook on life. Before Diamox, the Meniere's left me in a fog, both in vision and hearing. If anyone has also experienced trouble sleeping, please share what you have found to help, I would love to hear it!	8	July 4, 2019	11
Acetazolamide Tablets	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Mountain Sickness / Altitude Sickness	I took one of these pills (125mg) to try it before my vacation and I haven't felt so sick in a long time.  OMG it was horrible!!  It started with mild dizziness and tiredness.  Not so bad but by the 12th hour I just wanted to check out.  A lot of dizziness, very tired but couldn't sleep, nausea and headache.  Generally I felt awful but couldn't put my finger on how else it made me feel this awfulness.  I took a meclazine and some Advil and felt a bit better.  The next day, I still felt a bit weird but not so awful.  That stuff lasts a long time and if you take it on vacation and have my reaction, you'll waste a lot of hours being miserable.	1	July 3, 2019	3
Acetazolamide Tablets		I have suffered with migraines and severe dizziness and vertigo since I was 6. Neurologist put me on this. I've only taken it for 2 days but my headaches and dizziness are worse, I feel so tired I have double vision, excessively thirsty and tingling in face, hands and feet like pins and needles. I knew it wasn't going to work for my vertigo but was hoping I could tolerate it long enough to get the weight loss side effect, but I'd rather stay fat.	1	June 23, 2019	3
Acetazolamide Tablets	Glaucoma	I've been taking this for almost a month now at 500mg a day. Made me terribly sleepy at first and I slept almost all day on the first Sunday (4 days in), terrible abdominal pains, wooly head and nausea plus more frequent urination. Sleepiness has passed and I've been taking the tablets before a meal and that has helped with the abdominal pain. Still waking in the night to visit the loo but daytime urination has normalised. Nausea is a constant though and I have to force myself to eat. The consultant has given me another month's supply, oh joy.	6	June 20, 2019	3
Acetazolamide Tablets	Mountain Sickness / Altitude Sickness	Ok so I got these pills for altitude sickness in Peru and I got told to take one half in the morning and one half at night two days before high altitude. So I took a half when I arrived in Arequipa, around 2300m above sea level. With ONLY one small half, my hands started tingling, my whole face and me KNEES and even the upper part of my back. I couldn’t even walk correctly. Now it’s been around 27 hours I only took the half mentioned and my hands are still tingling. It is very annoying and ruined my first day in Arequipa. I won’t be taking them anymore, I prefer dealing with altitude sickness with coca gum and leaves than rather  not being able to use my body correctly. Also it’s true, you go to the bathroon all the time, so it’s no good if you are trekking and don’t have easy access to a toilet.	2	June 5, 2019	2
Acetazolamide Tablets	Hydrocephalus	I was diagnosed with Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH) a week ago and have been on the diamox for a week. It’s been a week of awfulness. Hands, feet and full face are numb and tingling. I also feel thumping in my face. I’m so tired and just sick. I’m nauseous ,major anxiety, I feel like I have the flu. I’m trying to get through this but I don’t know how much more I can take. I don’t know if there’s a different kind of medicine I can take for IIH. [if you check the internet there is an article in Medscape about Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH)]	1	May 31, 2019	12
Acetazolamide Tablets	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Mountain Sickness / Altitude Sickness	Upon arrival in Lhasa, Tibet at approx 3000 MAS(metres above sea level) I started getting a very bad head ache. Approx 8 hrs later the headache had progressed to extreme throbbing. I drank plenty of water and took diamox as prescribed by my g.p. for altitude sickness. The next day I signed myself up on tour to travel to nam tso @ approx 5000 mas..	10	May 28, 2019	6
Acetazolamide Tablets		I have been  acetazolamide drug for 3 months. My memory is foggy. I also have anxiety disorder. This medication has increased my anxiety at high dosage	2	May 14, 2019	3
Acetazolamide Tablets	Pseudotumor Cerebri	Acetazolamide isn’t fun but it does work really well for me. The headaches and vision loss I was suffering from pseudotumor cerebri were way worse than the side effects of this medicine. I haven’t noticed any of the side effects alleviating over time. I experienced my hands, mouth and feet tingling so much it hurt. It would wake me up at night and I’d have to walk around till the tingling stopped. My mood and energy have definitely been low since taking this medication. The worst side effect is probably the way food tastes, for me it is almost everything, not just carbonated beverages.	8	April 23, 2019	16
Acetazolamide Tablets	Glaucoma	Acetazolamide is great bringing down my eye pressure. I am also eating normally, but losing weight (yay), an unexpected added bonus. The first week left me feeling super down and tired, but now I feel great. In addition to the weight loss bonus my arthritis is way better. I used to hobble from stiff joints, and found it hard to lift my right arm, but not anymore! I am on 500mg twice day, and my eye pressure drops within minutes of taking it. There is a diarrhea side effect sometimes, but it isn't so bad for me. I drink a lot of water while taking this and that seems to help.	8	April 9, 2019	10
Acetazolamide Tablets	Diamox (acetazolamide)	I just started taking Acetazolamide 1/2 pill of 250 mg tab  for my   ringing in my left ear and I'm feeling tired and kind of weak I feel like going back to bed. My ENT DR prescribed this, does anyone else out there have similar problems??		March 30, 2019	8
Acetazolamide Tablets	Glaucoma	My worst side effect experience is lack of appetite and lethargy at times, now I have some diarrhea. But my eye pressure is down to 18 in one eye 13 in the left as of last check, but the loss off appetite concerns me	7	March 20, 2019	4
Acetazolamide Tablets	Pseudotumor Cerebri	My doctors had me taking 1500mg 2x a day, my headaches went away. I had problems getting the medication so I started taking 1000mg 2x a day and I was doing well, if I didn’t take any at all I would be able to go 2-3 days before getting a headache. I went about 6 months no medication and with no headaches before they started up again. I was able to get a hold of the medication but  I’m having trouble getting refills, I’ve been taking 2 pills every night and It works but I can feel them slowly coming back. I’ve been taking these pills for almost 4 years now and I’ve tried everything to take care of it, I’ve lost weight, taken headache OTC pills, coffee helps but not to get rid of them — please if anyone knows of an alternative to the medication that can help— willing to try anything at this point TBH.	10	January 27, 2019	7
Acetazolamide Tablets	Pseudotumor Cerebri	I was taking this 3x a day and it helped my ICP that began after brain surgery, but it slowly began to make me severely depressed and I didn’t realize that was the problem, until I ran out and went 2 days without it and my mood improved drastically. Not sure what to do now. Will see dr in 2 days	5	January 6, 2019	5
Acetazolamide Tablets	Pseudotumor Cerebri	I was on Diamox for about 2 months & it definitely helped. My worst side effect of it was a pressure that built on the bridge of my nose from it and my face would feel “shaky”. Hate it!	7	December 24, 2018	6
Acetazolamide Tablets	Hydrocephalus	I have Rebound Intracranial Hypertension (from Hypotension) .I was originally diagnosed with idiopathic intracranial HYPOtension (leaking spinal fluid), so I couldn't stand upright without my brain feeling like it was getting crushed.  Got a blood patch, was fixed for awhile, but now I'm one of the rare cases of now having too much spinal fluid, so my brain feels like its going to explode. I could've risked either a spinal tap (and possible lead back to the original hypotension) or go on Acetazolamide to reduce the amount of fluids in my body and my head.  Typical side effects everyone mentions here - soda tastes like garbage, and I get tingling hands/feet. I'm on one tablet of 250mg per day, and it's been able to stop the exploding headaches. I've been warned to see an optometrist to make sure the pressure isn't enough to cause optical nerve damage, but other than that, this is a working solution for me. Hoping to eventually ween myself off it.	10	December 6, 2018	12
Acetazolamide Tablets	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Mountain Sickness / Altitude Sickness	DO NOT if you have panic disorder. Had the worst panic attack of my life hours after taking it and thought I was gonna pass out and/or die. Guess I’ll just have to face the altitude sickness bc you couldn’t pay me ten trillion dollars to take this again.   FYI I think most people do not have this experience, just warning those who have bad anxiety!	1	October 19, 2018	7
Acetazolamide Tablets	Pseudotumor Cerebri	This medicine helped my migraines stop, but it caused me an insane amount of fatigued when I started it and when I stopped it. My hands, legs, feet, and sometimes other body parts tingled nonstop. Sometimes the tingle was so strong, it actually hurt. My hands tingled so much so that I couldn’t write, so I had to use my computer to take notes instead.  The one good thing from this medicine was the horrible migraines I’ve been suffering through never once occurred.	8	October 5, 2018	10
Acetazolamide Tablets	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Pseudotumor Cerebri	I had Pseudotumor Cerebri and  Papilledema (an eye condition that happens when pressure in your brain makes your optic nerve swell.) I was blind for 14 days. After taking Diamox I slowly regained my vision. I also had Gastric Bypass Surgery. This had me reduce my weight and any pressure. I am now cured.	9	October 2, 2018	65
Acetazolamide Tablets	Glaucoma	I am home from cataract surgery  have taken 3 pills. The soles of my feet were tingling with such intensity they hurt.  Did not last long, then around my mouth started tingling, feels like I ate as mango which I am highly allergic to.  Afraid to take the  last one	7	August 23, 2018	2
Acetazolamide Tablets	Pseudotumor Cerebri	I was diagnosed in 2013, I was told you have pressure headaches,  and I thought no big deal.  I stopped going to my Neuro Dr and he failed to give me the actual Dx or even tell me how serious my DX is.  I only learned I have IIH in 2018 when I requested my medical records, due to a worsening of my headaches, pulsating tinnutis, dizziness, visual disturbance, eye pain,  pressure, horrific headaches,  and feeling like I will live with a migraine like headache everyday of my life. I don't know about anyone else but when you start to think Trepanation (making a hole in your head) could be a good thing you know it is bad. I am now taking Acetazolamide again. Day 2: change in taste buds, carbonated drinks taste awful, cheese is terrible... Tingling in lips, face and hands.  Moderate stomach pain. Feelings of lethargy, decreased appetite,  generally feel unwell. My Dr advised some or all will go away.		July 6, 2018	9
Acetazolamide Tablets	Hydrocephalus	I have Chiari Malformation Type 1. (Basically, part of my brain is squeezing through the opening at the base of the skull where the spinal cord enters, and is putting pressure on the spinal cord - it's a congenital thing in almost all cases, but for me wasn't diagnosed until age 34. I have scoliosis, chronic pain, and chronic migraines all caused by the Chiari.) Was put on 125mg Diamox twice a day. So far it's reduced the severity of my migraines but not their frequency, and hasn't done anything for the pain. The tingling is the only side effect that hasn't gone away, and most of the time it doesn't bother me, but sometimes it's intense enough that I feel like I'm suffering oxygen deprivation from hyperventilating - my hands even start to go stiff. If I didn't know it was a meds side effect it'd be pretty worrying. Still, more pros than cons for me.	7	June 28, 2018	1
Acetazolamide Tablets	Glaucoma	I took this medicine once and the side effects are horrible. It decreases my potassium to the point that I felt the pressure on my head and it feels like I was about to collapse. My whole body started to feel numb and I was shaking and scared. (I was about to panic when I felt that numbness all over my body ) but I stayed calm and rested but I can still feel the tingling sensation. I pee a lot , dizziness and I feel like it triggers my anxiety.   But this medicine helped my eye pressure. I just took this once  and I will never take that again. Earlier I went to my opthamologist and he is kind of shocked that I said I was about to collapse and he said that don't take that medicine because of the side effects.  Right now I can still feel the tingling in my fingers and foot.  Ijust ate banana and it helps...	3	June 22, 2018	5
Acetazolamide Tablets	Pseudotumor Cerebri	I felt horrible for the first two weeks after being diagnosed with  pseudotumor cerbri, and taking the medicine 1000mg a day. The tingling in my hands face and toes comes and goes. I have had no more headaches or pressure in my sinuses since the first few weeks of starting it.	6	April 20, 2018	6
Acetazolamide Tablets	Glaucoma	I was diagnosed with intermediate uveitis 5 weeks ago and recently started on Diamox 2 weeks ago after my eye pressure started increasing from the steroid drops I am on. The first couple days I was much more tired and almost foggy minded. Also had to urinate much more often. Than after the first couple days, my body got very used to it. The only main symptom I have now is light tingling in my feet. My eye pressure was down from 39 to 28 in a weeks time.		April 7, 2018	7
Acetazolamide Tablets	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Edema	I was given diamox to treat bilateral ringing in the ears, headaches and pressure behind my eyes. I am 39 years old and I have lived with ringing in my ears all of my life. I have tried every available option out there to treat tinnitus and nothing has worked. I was referred to a new specialist dealing with ear diseases and he asked me a few questions and then prescribed diamox. Within 2 hours of taking diamox the ringing in my ears stopped completely and the pressure behind my eyes went away as well as headaches I've dealt with for years. I was shocked that this medicine is working as one of the side effects was ringing in the ears but I am having the opposite effect.	10	April 5, 2018	16
Acetazolamide Tablets	Glaucoma	This is the third time taking acetazolamide.  The main side effect for me is the eggy taste inmy mouth, constant loose bowels, numbness in my hands and feet and face, feeling cold, tired and week. think I've tried almost every eye drop on the market and pressures are still over 40.  I'm on this medication for 2 months four times a day.  My operation is on 3/5/18 really hoping the side effects ease off soon it's beginning to get me down.	6	March 19, 2018	4
Acetazolamide Tablets	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Glaucoma	Its a good medicine to decrease the Eye pressure.  While taking this tab - depression and dark thoughts are more and I have no interest in food, and also my  hands tickle like they are  in water.  Now I've stopped the medicine, my eye pressure become normal and constant. After stopping the medicine it takes a few  days  to decrease all the worst symptoms.   	8	February 17, 2018	13
Acetazolamide Tablets	Hydrocephalus	I am currently on this medication 500mg 2x's a day to treat the excess fluid gain on my brain that causes seizures. The first dose of this medication I instantly had a really bad taste for soda and for most anything that I ate or drank. I experienced extreme tiredness dizziness headaches and had a decrease in appetite. After about 2 days I noticed numbness and tingling in my hands and feet ringing in my ears a stabbing pressure pain in my eyes and abdominal pain I had to pee every 20-30 min and had extreme diarrhea instantly after every meal, all my bowel movements are diarrhea. After telling my neurologist about it he said they are common and to take once a day for 2 weeks to let my body adjust then back to 2x's. I fluctuate back and forth with the once and twice a day because he will not let me stop taking it and all of the affects still remain after 8 months of treatment but it has decreased the fluid levels on my brain and I lost 30 pounds are the only benefits	3	February 13, 2018	7
Acetazolamide Tablets	Pseudotumor Cerebri	I have been on Diamox for 3 weeks. I continue to have severe headaches still same pressure on my eyes and head. I can not stay awake taking this medicine. I get up and try to sit on couch and within 5 min I’m out. I see a Neurosurgeon in 3 days and I hope he can help me. I can’t even walk properly because my balance is so off. My wife is typing this as I speak.	1	February 5, 2018	6
Acetazolamide Tablets	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Pseudotumor Cerebri	I am 18 years old and I was diagnosed with pseudotumor cerebri after an allergic reaction to long term use of tetracyclines for acne. I went to the ER twice experiencing persistent, debilitating migraines, double vision, and one eye turned to face inward towards my nose, and they were unable to relieve any of it. My eye doctor, after a month of different testing, diagnosed me with pseudotumor cerebri and a neurologist started me on diamox and within two weeks my eye turned straight again, and the headaches and double vision were gone. I experienced the common tingling in my hands and feet, difficulty drinking carbonated beverages, small rashes, and lethargy from diamox, but it was all bearable after a week and within a month I am fixed.	10	December 19, 2017	39
Acetazolamide Tablets	Pseudotumor Cerebri	All I have to say is that this pill has made my life so much better. Three years ago this pseudotumor cerebri started after having my first born. I was at my heaviest at 245lb pounds. Ever since I've never been the same until now although I deal with the side effects (sleepy, muscle weakness , tiredness, tingling ) being sleepy has been the worst to cope with because I'm a mother and I have things to do BUT at least some days I'm able to function well and that's better than nothing. I also take Potassium which helps a lot for the tingling !!! I hope one day I no longer have to take these pills and finally have my life back and enjoy it ! BTW I'm 21 yrs old	6	December 18, 2017	8
Acetazolamide Tablets	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Pseudotumor Cerebri	I have been on Diamox since 2004 when I was first diagnosed with a pseudotumor cerebri. I was hospitalized for 5 days after experiencing paralysis in my legs, severe headaches, nausea and visual impairment.  I have tried to stop taking the medication but had to return to it due to the severe headaches and cranial swelling.  I have constant problems with electrolyte deficiencies and have to take additional medications to alleviate other problems.  This is still the best treatment I have experienced.  In addition to this condition, I also have Lupus, HBP, Hypothyroidism and I am Bi-polar.	9	December 4, 2017	26
Acetazolamide Tablets	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Pseudotumor Cerebri	Side effects far worse than  Idiopathic Intracranial Hypertension (IIH) it's self. Constantly nauseous, made no difference to headaches/pressure, suffered with slight breathing difficulties & palpitations, the tingling in hands and feet were more like cramp than tingling in the end... the list goes on..	1	November 12, 2017	20
Acetazolamide Tablets	Glaucoma	My eye pressure was up in the 40s and Dr. gave me 1 pill only to help get it down. About 20 mins later I started  feeling numbness all over my legs, arms, nose and upper lip. It was annoying but not painful. I was needing to pee very often and was super low energy the rest of the day. Glad I only had to take the 1 pill. It  only slightly helped the eye  pressure issue.	5	September 20, 2017	4
Acetazolamide Tablets	Glaucoma	For lowering pressure the medication is very effective, however the side effects are a nightmare. I get tingling sensations everywhere, dehydration, increased urine, drowsiness. It doesn't help that I'm also a teenager who needs to concentrate on my studies so it's a miracle I managed to get through school recently.	5	September 3, 2017	6
Acetazolamide Tablets	Pseudotumor Cerebri	I was diagnosed with Pseudotumor Cerebri in February 2015. When I got pregnant with my son I gained over 60lbs. I had him in May 2014 and didn't have any symptoms until October 2014 when my eyesight went out for a second or two and it didn't happen again. I didn't pay it any mind until in January 2015 it started getting worse. My vision would go in and out for about 2-5 seconds at a time. I finally seen the ophthalmologist who said my optic nerves were swollen & referred me to a neurologist who had me do an MRI, 1 spinal tap (where my pressure was so high at 44, so they relieved some of the spinal fluid down to 20), then they finally decided to put me on Acetazolamide 500mg ER. The only cons were the metallic taste and tingling.	9	July 17, 2017	14
Acetazolamide Tablets	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Pseudotumor Cerebri	Works amazingly!	10	June 24, 2017	19
Acetazolamide Tablets	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Mountain Sickness / Altitude Sickness	Anyone planning to take this medication for altitude sickness prophylaxis, I recommend you do a trial run at home first. I took this medication to hike the inca trail and started it the day before flying to Cusco. I developed a rare side effect of blurred vision/myopia which came on about an hour after the second dose of diamox. The myopia lasted for 72 hours after ceasing the medication. It almost ruined my trip but fortunately vision returned just in time to start the hike. I went on dexamethasone after that for prophylaxis. No side effects but unfortunately the Dex didn't work as I got altitude sickness.........but that's another story!		June 23, 2017	16
Acetazolamide Tablets	Pseudotumor Cerebri	My experience with acetazolamide has been okay. I started taking it after my lumbar puncture to relieve the pressure.  (I got IIH because it was a rare side effect of an antibiotic I was on for my acne, minocycline) it has been VERY effective at relieving the pressure, but gives really annoying side effects, like tingling of my fingers, face, and toes. Like when I'm trying to sleep my feet tingle and go crazy and it makes it impossible to sleep. It also made me have little to no appetite and I have lost 20 pounds in about 2 months. I my neurologist told me that long term use of this medication can cause kidney damage, but 6 months to a year shouldn't be a worry. (I am only going to be on diamox for 6 months. I've been on it for 4 months)	7	June 23, 2017	8
Acetazolamide Tablets	Pseudotumor Cerebri	I was just recently diagnosed with high intracranial pressure with no papilledema and a huge blind spot I my left eye. I was told that a spinal tap would only cause a leak since I have a connective tissue disorder. I got an MRI and CT and everyone said they were normal excect for Dr. Driscoll. She started me on diamox and it has done wonders!!! I can see at dark now and I don't have constant eye pain/pressure, neck pain or problems sleeping. I have to sleep with a soft cervical collar and had to raise the head of my bed to make sure the fluid continues to drain even when sleeping. I do have numbness and tingling but it's more amusing to me than painful. It is difficult to keep your CO2 levels at 22 but use alkaline h20	8	June 17, 2017	7

Acetazolamide Tablets	Pseudotumor Cerebri	"I was 19 when I was sent from my small town & county to have tests done. I'd had symptoms from age 12 when I was put on birth control pills for PCOS. The Dr from San Francisco put me on Diamox and prednisone and ordered my family Dr do a spinal tap when I had eye problems or severe headaches (he did at least 3/wk for 2yrs). My family Dr took me off the prednisone after a few months and I gained over 100lbs. The Diamox caused me weird side effects. My face was all ""tingling"", everything I ate or drank tasted metallic (especially if it was fruit or carbonated). Eventually the tingling started down my neck, chest, and hands/arms. So my Dr took me off it, gave me hydroclorathazide (it maybe misspelt). I've learned Diamox causes it a lot."	2	April 18, 2017	2
Acetazolamide Tablets	Pseudotumor Cerebri	I'm 28 and I was diagnosed with  Pseudotumor  a little over two years now I've had a VP shunt an LP shunt  and multiple lumbar punctures,  I've been taking  Acetazolmide  and I've had no side effects so far...  but I'm still having really bad headache's and swelling of my eyeballs,  so yesterday my neurologist decided that instead of taking two  pills in the morning and two pills at night,  I'll start taking three pills in the morning and three pills at night.  I just want to feel better!	10	March 19, 2017	3
Acetazolamide Tablets	Pseudotumor Cerebri	I've been taking this medication regularly for the past month and want to cry.  I'm 20 years old, a healthy female, and was diagnosed with pseudotumor cerebri.  I call my mom nearly everyday complaining of a new pain.  From the horrible tingly sensation in my hands and feet, to the horrible confusion, and now extreme pain in my abdomen, I'm ready for this all to stop.  I'm on 500 mg/daily and can't even operate my vehicle!  I am always so out of it it makes finished my homework assignments difficult let alone to constant new pains I always complain about.  I am pretty tough but when it comes to seeing my doctor every week due to the side effects of this medication, it's not worth it.	1	March 6, 2017	12
Acetazolamide Tablets	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Pseudotumor Cerebri	Hello. I am 18 and I have diagnosed with Idiopathic intracranial hypertension (IIH) December of 2016. As we all thought, I had a concussion because I played volleyball but it didn't quite flow with the big blind spot in my left eye and the perfect MRI and MRE scan results. Well, as my opening pressure from an LP was 49.7, more than half for my age, and being the first patient for my pediatrician, I have Psuedo Tumor Cerebri. My new neurologists put me on 2,000mg a day. Yes, this caused severe abdominal and GI upset for almost the first month I was taking it and a little bit here and there. My ophthalmologist has seen an improvement. My second LP as of 1/30/17 had an opening pressure of 28.7. They drained me to normal and took 10cc of instead of 8. I hope it keeps working.	8	February 19, 2017	22
Acetazolamide Tablets	Pseudotumor Cerebri	I just started acetazolemide a few days ago.  500mg 2x a day.  I had an lumbar puncture 2 days ago and neither have relieved much of the pressure.  Every time I take one of these pills I get a new symptom.  My kidney function has been weaker.  The pressure in my head continues.  My body aches all over.  The yucky taste....that is the least of my worries.  Pins and needles...check.  Extremely tired and feel like I've been beat.  I feel like bricks are laying inside my hips.  This stuff sucks!!	1	February 19, 2017	11
Acetazolamide Tablets	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Mountain Sickness / Altitude Sickness	After several bird tours flirting with 10,000 - 11,000 ft elevation I became suspicious that I was  susceptible to alt. sickness.  A redirected flight to LaPaz, Bolivia (and some unscheduled ascents near Cochabamba) convinced me I was.  Typically I serve as a human altimeter, within minutes of reaching 11,000 ft I'm puking my guts out.  Diamox has been a wonder drug in preventing alt. sickness on tours I've been on since Bolivia.  I've travelled from 8,000 ft straight to 14,000 ft several times with no alt. sickness symptoms at all.  125 mg before bed is all I need.  Tingling and bad tasting soda symptoms are greatly reduced at that dosage compared to the 250mg I initially used.	10	February 15, 2017	10
Acetazolamide Tablets	Diamox (acetazolamide) for Pseudotumor Cerebri	Diamox changed my life I had 24/7 pressure headache for 7 years of my life I went everywhere even to the mayo clinic and had test after test and scan after scan and finally my local neurologist tried this medication and it has made me able to live again for the first time in 7 years! I was diagnosed with chronic daily headache and told I would never get better but to everyone suffering there is hope don't believe what a few drs say keep searching for answers. Try this medication if nothing else has worked for you!	8	February 11, 2017	29

Acidophilus	Vaginal Yeast Infection	I recently started taking Jardiance for my diabetes, and immediately developed a yeast infection (a common side effect). I picked up an OTC treatment, which worked, but I wanted something that would work long term, so I invested in the slightly more expensive acidophilus, with the billion cultures (at CVS). I take one each day, but if it gets a bit itchy, I take another and that gets my system back on track!	10	November 13, 2020	4

However, the best thing that’s ever happen to me was discovering acidophilus. When I take them regularly there’s no irritation at all, and everything feels very healthy down there. Would definitely recommend trying this out, a very easy and relatively cheap solution. I usually get mine from places like Walgreens or health food stores like Whole Foods.	10	August 8, 2020	9
Acidophilus	Vaginal Yeast Infection	I was prescribed a 10 day course of bactrim  antibiotics for treatment of an abscess. Around day 4, I started to get a little itchy “down there”. I immediately drove to CVS, picked up a bottle of acidophilus capsules, and the symptoms were gone by the next morning.	10	January 18, 2020	17
Acidophilus		I had bacterial vaginitis on and off since I was 16. I could take prescribed medications and it wouldn’t return for 6-12months. Once I turned 21, I had it for 4 solid years, it was so embarrassing! I inserted boric acid capsules after sex to keep it hidden from my relationship of 3 years and had a sex schedule to keep him from finding out. Finally, I found out about acidophilus and bifidus  to help get rid of bacterial vaginitis (BV) through intense forum research, I took 1 with each meal for 2 days and I haven’t had BV since!! It had been an off and on again battle for nearly a decade and I was suffering really low self esteem because of it. I’m so happy I found out about this probiotic! Been BV free for 6 fricken months!!	10	August 22, 2019	23
Acidophilus	Vaginal Yeast Infection	One word, GREAT! I’ve used it 6 days now and the results are astounding!!! Recommend it for ever lady going through a yeast infection.	10	August 17, 2019	22
Acidophilus	Vaginal Yeast Infection	Acidophilus is the miracle to stop problem yeast infection for me.  I have been taking acidophilus since 2016 and it saved my life	10	June 22, 2019	28
Acidophilus	Vaginal Yeast Infection	OK so I have been getting yeast infections every week for the last 2 months the Dr would give me a diflucan and at the end of the 7 days the yeast infection was back like it never left I was in and out of the gynecologist office and my primary Dr. I went to the Dr a week ago and he tells me he cannot give me any more diflucan because my system  will become  used to it. He was like just try acidophilus that's my final recommendation. I took my last diflucan that I had in my stash the yeast infection started to return yesterday you guessed it was the end of the 7 days so I took the acidophilus pill last night and I feel like a new women I just hope it keeps working	10	March 23, 2019	32
Acidophilus	Vaginal Yeast Infection	Get the probiotic acidophilus capsules (i buy from dollar tree). Then take a steamy hot shower.  After that open a few capsules and mix into a cream (i use a monostat cream) , making a paste. Apply to the poor hurting burning vag and then drink water. Lots of water. Swallow a few more capsules. Do this every day and it will help.	10	December 14, 2018	15
Acidophilus	Vaginal Yeast Infection	OMG! On a scale from 1 to 10 I give this stuff a MILLION! I have been battling a yeast infection for nearly 2 months. After 3 boxes of Monistat, 8 boxes of yogurt and 2 tubes of itch cream, 4 tiny tablets have completely turned things around! I mean, it was so painful and itched SOOOOO BAD! I literally felt like I would never get back to normal. My mom suggested Acidophilus yesterday. I stopped by her house and picked up a bottle that expires in 2 months, but I was so desperate I didn't care. The dosage said to take 2 tablets, but with it nearing its expiration I decided to take 2 and then later another 2 . 24 HOURS LATER I feel like a new woman! Thank you Acidophilus and thank you Mom !!!	10	September 6, 2018	31
Acidophilus	Vaginal Yeast Infection	Okay so, I’ve had a very bad yeast infection, the itching and burning was UNBEARABLE, I literally could not even stand up at work for long periods of time. The pain got worse and started affecting my skin on/around my vagina. Everything I tried just wasn’t helping. The discharge was getting worse and so was the burning. My mother brought me a bottle of the  Acidophilus and advised me to take the the powder out of the capsule and apply the powder directly to the area, this method did calm my symptoms down a WHOLE LOT, but when it started to wear off from me going to urinate, the itching would return . So finally I inserted a capsule into my vagina before bed and the next day I felt GREAT! I was a little hesitant about doing this because I wasn’t sure how safe it really was but I wish I would’ve done this a long time ago. I’ve experienced no itching or burning ever since I’ve inserted the capsule into my vagina for the FIRST time.	8	August 7, 2018	33
Acidophilus	Vaginal Yeast Infection	I have type 1 diabetes and because of high blood sugar levels I used to suffer from yeast infections at least twice a year. A friend told me about acidophilus pills and I am forever grateful. I take them by mouth a couple of times a month to prevent yeast infections and if I ever feel one coming on or just generally feel any kind of irritation I will break a pill in half and wet it a bit so its more comfortable and insert into the affected area. You definitely need to get comfortable with yourself to do that, but it's so worth it. It won't completely break down and might come back out after a couple days, but it works. Taking too many by mouth gave me a little bloating and gas, but I'll take that over the painful infections. I hope this helps	10	November 24, 2017	22
Acidophilus	Vaginal Yeast Infection	I am a person who has suffered from constant yeast infections for a long time.If you stared too hard at me I might catch one .Everything irritated me from body wash/jacuzzi water/ or anything with a scent would have me right back in the dr's office. I usually prefer diflucan pills because it works but I wanted to try a different route because even though diflucan gets rid of the problem,it seems to always come back.I bought these pills from a local Walgreens and I took one orally and it did make me feel a little weird and I inserted one vaginally but it did not hurt.Slight stinging every so often but it's nothing major.I hope this works !	5	August 15, 2017	12
Acidophilus	Vaginal Yeast Infection	I'm not necessarily the best person to give a review on this, because I have CONSTANT yeast infections ALL THE TIME. It's torture. Whenever I go to the doctor I get my diflucin pill, Monistat cream, and I usually still have issues. I'm yet to find a solution.   However, I did try this pill out and it's pretty great! If you have any swelling down there, this gets rid of it overnight. As for the actual yeast, mine hasn't completely cleared up but it's getting a lot better. I think this could possibly get rid of it if I keep using it consistently. I'm only on day 3 of this and I've seen a significant difference and feel much better.   I recommend this to people who want to get rid of any swelling and need an alternative to the actual doctor.	8	August 7, 2017	18
Acidophilus	Vaginal Yeast Infection	I suffered from chronic yeast infections for well over four years.  I found a specialist  who had done extensive research on this condition.  However, the waiting list to see him was 11 months.  I had been to numerous doctors with no relief.  He was able to provide temporary relief with a long-term regime of flagyl and metrogel.  I subsequently moved to Texas and the infection returned.  A short time later I met a young lady who earned her master's degree in nutrition in London.  She suggested I take acidophilus and golden seal root daily.  In a very short time the infection disappeared and hasn't returned in over 7 years.  Additionally, it has boosted my immune system tremendously.		June 15, 2017	59
AcipHex	GERD	I have been taking brand name Aciphex since probably late 1990s. 20 mg/day magically disappeared my symptoms after all other PPIs and H2 blockers eventually failed.  Then the price started to go up so I celebrated the day the patent expired.  Generic rabeprazole was a great disappointment so we (my GI doc and I) kept writing letters to insurance so they would pay for the brand name.  Eventually the price went out of control so we had to abandon that option.  We found out that Eisai ltd. the manufacturer of Aciphex also manufactured the generic rabeprazole under the name of Pariet in Great Britain.  This worked so far for the last couple of years but I have to double the dose to 40 mg/day and combine it with 20 mg of famotidine.  I read other reviews that indicate people had similar frustrating experiences when switching to generic rabeprazole.  I wonder what makes that difference and why?	9	November 14, 2020	7
AcipHex	Barrett's Esophagus	I was diagnosed with Barrett's esophagus and GERD @ 19 years ago.  My doctor put me on Aciphex and it work great.  My next scope Barrett's was healed but I was still taking Aciphex for GERD until insurance would no longer pay for it.  I could not afford the atrocious cost if Aciphex and switched.  I have tried all OTC, prescription Prilosec, and Prevacid.  None have worked as well as Aciphex.  I also have epilepsy and have to be mindful of drug interactions even with PPI's.   It's really sad that pharmaceutical and insurance companies dictate to consumers what they can and can't take based on monetary greed.  Who knows better than the consumer what is best, and works best, in treating their physical health & well being.	10	November 2, 2019	21
AcipHex	GERD	I've had GERD for 20+ years.  Tried all of the medications but seemed to build up resistance to them and they would no longer work after several months.  ACIPHEX is the only one that worked consistently, however, insurance wouldn't pay for it.  My doctor wrote several letters and finally got it approved.  I am now on Medicare and it is not on an approved list where I can get it.  It is truly a miracle drug and has worked for me consistently.  I, too, don't know why there is not a generic form or why it is not more affordable.  I would give this a 10 out of 10.	10	December 21, 2018	15
AcipHex	GERD	Taken since 2005, it was the only PPI that worked. 2018 started having side effects, tired, muscle aches, complications with cramps in back and other similar pains related to muscles. Stopped taking and problems disappeared. After 2 months of discomfort and GERD back again, I tried it again, after 3 days side effects returned. Time to change, too bad, it worked for 12 years.	5	October 14, 2018	16
AcipHex	GERD	I am just on second day of starting generic Acifex and can not believe how great I feel. I have been in pain and diarrhea for a month due to taking multiple meds for a heart issue. Acifex has been a blessing!	9	December 9, 2017	7
AcipHex	Barrett's Esophagus	Have Taken ACIPHEX for 20 years until insurance companies refused to cover this and all PPI drugs. I have suffered ever since. Achipex 3 years ago cost $20.00 per 30 Tablets, Then in 2015,16 this medication increased to $378.00 per 30 tablets. Now my insurance company will not cover this drug. I am on my own. No PPI prescription drugs anymore. So, for every action there is a opposite and equal reaction. Scopes yearly. which will cost my insurance company more than a year of this drug. Idiots. Nothing works except ACIPHEX 20 MGs		July 5, 2017	21
Acitretin	Psoriasis	Had severe psoriasis on the palm of both hands and Acitretin was prescribed when topical creams, light box, methotrexate did not work. I still have minor skin peeling/cracking but nothing like the open sores on my fingertips, swelling and pain I had before. Side effect I've experienced so far is the chapped lips and the constant ringing in my head especially loud upon waking up in the morning. I stopped taking the med to see if I was cured and in 2 days I started to see a flare up so here I am. I truly hope there's an end to this treatment in the near future;  the side effects for long term use can be scary.	7	June 3, 2020	5
Acitretin	Psoriasis	I have been on this drug acitretin for 3 months and it has cleared my palms and  plantar psoriasis somewhat.  The side effects I am experiencing are dry waxy lips, gums and loss of taste buds as well as terrible breakout on my face that were never there until I started the drug.  My question is will it get better. My face and skin is waxy and rashy. I am thinking about coming off of it because of the side effects but it has improved my hands and feet which is why I started taking it.	4	March 20, 2020	6
Acitretin	Psoriasis	I am on this along with siliq. Couple months in I am only getting worse. Frustrated. The last time on acitretin my hair fell out. I was not verbally warned. Now I know it could happen. Use the lips chap on this.	2	January 19, 2020	3
Acitretin	Psoriasis	In Feb 2019, started  acitretin 25 mg for palms of hands and soles of feet.  Never eliminated all the psoriasis symptoms,  but greatly reduced peeling, redness,  and itching.   Worst side effect was very chapped lips until Jun 2019 when my hair started falling out and breaking away.  After 34 yrs of keeping gray at bay, I stopped coloring my hair in Jul 2019 thinking that might be triggering the hair exodus.   I stopped taking Acetritin in Aug 2019 and the hair continues to fall out (now Sep 2019).  My dermatologist has ordered blood work to identify triggers.   Fingers crossed!		September 20, 2019	4
Acitretin	Psoriasis	acitretin is worst drug I ever tried. Within 12 days I turned from 10% covered to 70% covered new lesions everywhere my scalp totally covered with new patches very dry lips, hair loss and peeling hands I stopped it quickly and the side effects still takes effect after 5 weeks really nasty drug I regret I tried it.	1	September 5, 2019	9
Acitretin	Psoriasis	I started taking acitretin in February 2018, starting at 25mg a day and then moving up to 50mg once I had a blood test to show that my bloods had remained normal. I continued to take 50mg a day for about 7 months, and only after that long did the drug have an effect - in the space of about a week my psoriasis (massive plaques all over my shins and back) had gone completely. However my bloods had been effected - my cholesterol and tryglicerides had gone up to way beyond the normal level for a man of my age. In terms of side effects I didnt' find them too bad. I started to get sweaty palms which I had never had before and once every few weeks the skin on my hands and face would get very peely - but nothing moisturiser couldn’t fix. I have now not been taking the drug for 6 months and I have a few small patches on my legs and elbows - but nothing that bothers me too much. All in all I’d say it’s worth it - just be prepared that it can take a very long time to work!	8	July 3, 2019	5
Acitretin	Psoriasis	I have been taking Acitretin for about 6 weeks, 25mg daily. My psoriasis has mostly cleared still got white patches but I find the side effects are terrible. I constantly itch especially on my scalp, I never had psoriasis on my scalp. My arms and legs have peeled and my hands and feet continue to peeI, they look awful. My lips are chapped I have a waxy layer in my mouth which means I can’t taste food anymore and my skin feels waxy and sticky as well and so fragile I just have to brush against something and it takes a layer off. At this moment I am full of grazes from all the scratching. I know that these are the side effects stated but will it ever get better?	6	April 21, 2018	8

Acitretin	Psoriasis	I’ve been on Acitretin for over a year. Overall it has helped my psoriasis, I’m not completely clear but the flakeyness has completely gone and the redness has reduced in areas.   The side effects have made me question whether or not to continue on the drug. I was initially on 25mg but there was 0 changes to my psoriasis, I was then put onto 50mg and my psoriasis started to disappear extremely fast. On 50mg I was constantly tired and my skin was peeling on my lips, I also feel the effect of weakened nails of which I’ve had an ingrown toe nail on both feet!  I was dropped to 35mg (currently on) and my psoriasis is at a stale mate, it definitely isn’t improving. I’m constantly fatigued and will hopefully be getting off them in December.

Acitretin	Psoriasis	I was prescribed 25mg per day and for three months took the drug until the pain in my back, joints and muscles led me to believe I had bone cancer.  After researching and the drug and finding out these are common side effects I stopped taking the drug.  My psoriasis had cleared up, I was able to go to the hairdresser without being embarrassed of condition of my scalp and my legs and back also cleared.  Six months later, with the returning at it's worse, I again started taking the drug.  This time however there was not improvement in my skin and the joint and muscle pain was unbearable.  I have once again stopped taking the drug, for two weeks now, and can not move without groaning due to the continuing muscle pain.		September 8, 2017	11
Acitretin	Psoriasis	I commenced this drug very slowly (10mg/day), worked up to 30mg over the course of a month.  The psoriasis on my hands responded very quickly but was pretty painful while it was shedding.  The psoriasis on my feet took much longer but did respond eventually.  I had problems with side effects however.  I had to reduce my dose to 20mg one month after increasing to 30mg.  My face (no psoriasis on my face) was red, scaly, so painful that I couldn't wear my glasses, the inside of my nose was bleeding and sore, the inside of my mouth was peeling, my gums were bleeding and my vision was effected. Even on 20mg my vision has continued to decline my hair is falling out I have no eyebrows or eyelashes. I gave up yesterday. Its worked but at a cost.		August 16, 2017	8
Acitretin	Soriatane (acitretin) for Psoriasis	I have palmoplantar pustular PsA with 4 other types of psoriasis.  25 mg per day did nothing. 50mgs/daily has helped the pustular on hands and feet, but other psoriasis forms in groin area, skin folds, under arms, head, nails, are not cooperating- in fact the psoriasis is growing in those areas.

Aclasta	Osteoporosis	Had an Aclasta infusion in June 2018 and I am still having adverse reactions.  These are severe shivers, sweats, extreme tiredness and severe itching, loss of appetite and nausea.  Immediately after the infusion I was unable to get out of bed for three days and had severe backaches.  I have read that it can take up to 24 months to get it out of your system.  I have gone passed that time frame and still suffering.  I am so over it and will NEVER EVER have another infusion.	1	March 3, 2021	6
Aclasta	Osteoporosis	I had my infusion four days ago just one week after I got my diagnosis. They didn’t tell me to drink lots of water, I read about online the day of the infusion. Was a bit shocked when I also read about the severe side effects here but really felt I didn’t have a choice. I had very very mild side effects, the next morning I felt the same way I do after two glasses of wine the night before. Nothing more. Feel completely fine now. I am an active 44 year old and I got osteoporosis from very early menopause due to cancer treatments ten years ago. I really hope it will give me good results in the long run.	6	February 13, 2021	2
Aclasta	Osteoporosis	I am a 24 year old female runner with osteopenia and after sustaining a stress fracture in my femoral neck my specialists suggested an Aclasta infusion. I felt fine the afternoon after the infusion however at about 12am that night I was woken by severe stomach cramping. When I tried to get out of bed I had the most intense migraine and nausea I eventually passed out. I was then bed ridden and slept for 40 hours straight waking every 4hrs to take more pain relief. I even needed oxycodone the pain was that bad. These severe symptoms eased after 48hrs however 1 week before my infusion I dislocated my right patella and so it blew up with swelling and pain and I couldn’t walk, meaning I had to spend the next three days in bed and off work. I couldn’t believe a treatment of this time could have such grotesque side effects, it was honestly a horrific and borderline traumatic experience. I think people should really consider the benefits of an Aclasta infusion before going ahead with it.	2	July 1, 2020	23
Aclasta	Osteoporosis	Had 1st Aclasta Feb 2019 for Osteoporosis and I also have OI type 1. Had a fall and smashed knee cap in June then had 2nd Aclasta infusion in Feb this year with bone density test which went from Osteoporosis back to osteopenia. So its working. I was also given pamphlets to read about pros and cons b4 hand.  So knew side effects.	10	May 14, 2020	16
Aclasta	Osteoporosis	I had the infusion about 4 weeks ago and I felt ok after the infusion which was about 3pm in the afternoon.  However, in bed that same night around 11pm I started to feel immense cramps in my abdomen and soon after I started vomiting.  I was shaking uncontrollably and I was so cold, my temperature was over 38.  We drove to the nearest emergency department which  I was assessed and immediately put on pain killers and anti-nausea drugs intravenously.  After that I was sent to imaging and I couldn't walk due to the excruciating pain and had to be wheeled to radiology and x-ray. The event seems like a blur all I remember was the pain.  I felt pain for about a week after, the first few days being intense.  I will not be going through that again and I have also blocked my calls from my specialist who recommended I should have this done.   I still have paid today after nearly FOUR weeks.....	1	May 1, 2020	29
Aclasta	Osteoporosis	I had no side effects. Before the dose of Aclasta  I had a typical tennis elbow. It is still painful at times. What I only experience now is hair loss since getting tis in Feb. I'm aware that you do shed a couple of hairs before a season change. But this is different. After a hair shampooing the hair came loose as if I'm having cancer treatment. Where I walk. All over in the house you will find hair on the floor.   Did anyone else experience this same effect?	5	April 8, 2020	14
Aclasta	Osteoporosis	I had aclasta 10 days ago and had a  quite a severe reaction where my body ached terribly all over and I could barely walk for 24 hours. The next 2 days I was left with my body feeling dull pain all over. Since the infusion I’ve had the worst pain in my thoracic area like I have a knife stabbing me and it won’t budge. I had an X-ray no broken rib. Had a massage nothing will fix it. So hard sleeping. I had no idea I’d be left like this.	3	March 24, 2020	25
Aclasta	Osteoporosis	I had Aclasta on the 21st November2019. No  side affects for about a week now everyday I wake up with side effects  with bone pain and muscle pain. Sometimes my feet are very sore. Hope all this stops soon. I will not be having anymore Aclasta.	4	December 9, 2019	23
Aclasta	Osteoporosis	I had Aclasta once a year 2012 - 2015 due to osteoporosis - Worst mistake I ever made! I have daily incapacitating and severe joint, muscle and back pain, cannot have a tooth extracted due to osteonecrosis of the jaw (as per the maxillo facial surgeon), my vision became blurred almost immediately after The first session ... my life is no longer my healthy happy life and I have to endure rhizotomies (Which have not helped one bit) because of the back pain. Walking is painful. Shoulders are messed.  There is no antidote for this drug either! This was not something we are told beforehand ... we are still deciding to join a class action against the company that manufactures this drug KNOWING what the aide effects are! We would NEVER have said yes! Do your research guys! Bev - South Africa	1	December 5, 2019	40
Aclasta	Osteoporosis	Had an infusion of Aclasta 10 days ago. Had been diagnosed with compression fracture of spine a week prior. I wasn't really advised of adverse reactions and  only told I would benefit due to very low bone score. Had hyperparathyroidism which caused the osteoporosis. After Aclast I had side effects of severe dizzy spell on day 2 and could not stand up lasted two days. I also had nausea and mild headache. After one week severe pain in both wrists could not hold anything lasted 3 days. I have pain in my jaw and eyelids. It is mild but constant. Hope all will come right shortly. I feel tired and slightly achy every day. Hope benefits out way  side effects.	4	May 17, 2019	40
Aclasta	Osteoporosis	My 85 year old mother has been having this infusion every year for the last 4 years. The first time she had it she was quite sick afterwards with body aches and fatigue. And wishing she never had it. The Doctor said next time ask for it to be slowly administered And it did make a huge difference with no side effects. And now she makes sure it gets administered slowly. Not everyone seems to know about this.		April 8, 2019	46
Aclasta	Osteoporosis	My husband was administered Aclasta on 18 Feb 2019. He started feeling feverish, vomiting, shivering, and severe weakness  the next day. He could not even walk. After nine days, he is still feeling very weak and not able to do any work. He was healthy before the infusion. We don't know what to do. We are helpless. Seeing my husband's   condition, would not recommend Aclasta to anybody. Can someone help?		February 28, 2019	45
Aclasta	Osteoporosis	Lots of bone aching all over my body including teeth. One week after  the first infusion I couldn't lift my arms.	3	July 10, 2018	39
Aclasta	Osteoporosis	I had two infusions during two years period. One day suddenly I had so much pain on my upper leg. I had no trauma prior to the pain. Bone scan shows I had a typical fracture on my femur.  Dr didn't tell me the side effect about the drug . I am so disappointed. I thought the drug suppose to strength my bone but does the opposite.	1	April 26, 2018	41
Aclidinium	Tudorza Pressair (aclidinium) for COPD	It did help for the breathing but gave me lots of side effects.  Heart palpitations, chest pain, very dry mouth, fatigue, headaches and urinary retention were the most troublesome.  These side effects did not go away with time. I could deal with some of them but not with others. I also notice that my resting heart rate went down from 60-65 to 50-55 while taking Turdoza.  Could have been the cause of the fatigue?  When I quit cold turkey, I had the worst withdrawal symptoms for weeks even though the pharmacist told me it could not come from the medication.  As soon as I re-started the Turdoza, the symptoms lessen.  I had to slowly quit.  Still one of the worst experience of my life, especially the extreme fatigue, extreme shortness of breath and constant PVCs.  I just could not function. So yes, there is no doubt in my mind that that drug does have withdrawal symptoms and that you must stop it slowly.  Please note that this was MY experience and your mileage may vary.	4	February 21, 2021	2
Aclidinium	Tudorza Pressair (aclidinium) for COPD	My doctor gave me some samples of this when I couldn’t afford Spiriva. I’m very pleased with Tudorza but 2 of the inhalers don’t work all the time. Does anyone have suggestions?	9	April 29, 2020	2
Aclidinium	Tudorza Pressair (aclidinium) for COPD, Maintenance	Since starting this medication 6 months ago, I have had one tooth break and seven cavities.  They don't tell you that this drug will rot your teeth.	2	February 20, 2020	2
Aclidinium	Tudorza Pressair (aclidinium) for COPD, Maintenance	I used Tudorza for one year, it worked great. I had a coupon that worked with my Medicare insurance. There is no longer a coupon that works with Medicare so unfortunately I have stopped using Tudorza. Do these companies not realize that people who are on Medicare cannot afford these expensive drugs and need these coupons?	10	October 9, 2019	12
Aclidinium	Tudorza Pressair (aclidinium) for COPD	Began Turdorza almost 2 weeks ago.  Good stuff but now having trouble breathing with lots of pressure in my chest.  So impressed with this med up until now.  So disappointed that I won't be able to keep taking it.  Atrovent and similar meds cause same problems but didn't work as well as Tudorza has.

Aclidinium	Tudorza Pressair (aclidinium) for COPD	I was using Tudorza for COPD and went back to Spiriva as there was no copay. After 2 weeks on the Spiriva I am back to Tudorza.

Aclidinium	Tudorza Pressair (aclidinium) for COPD, Maintenance	I feel normal for the first time since being diagnosed about 2 years ago. This has been a miracle drug for me with virtually no side effects.	10	September 28, 2018	5
Aclidinium	Tudorza Pressair (aclidinium) for COPD	"I too had to change to Spiriva because Medicare doesn't cover Turdoza. Figured "" what's the difference anyway? An inhaler is an inhaler, right? Well, I've asked special permission from doctor today because they AREN'T all the same, are they? I'm short of breath again ! Odd, because Medicaid covered it but not Medicare."	10	July 18, 2018	8
Aclidinium	Tudorza Pressair (aclidinium) for COPD	I do best with Tudorza.  Prescription drug companies do not want to cover it, so my doctor sends in a special request.  For me it works so much better than Spiriva.  I can  breathe without taking rescue inhaler so much.  It is good we have choices on inhalers.	10	March 27, 2018	6
Aclidinium	Tudorza Pressair (aclidinium) for COPD	When I was diagnosed with COPD my doctor put me on Tudorza, what a miracle drug unfortunately my medical plan will not allow for me to have this.  I pray some day I will be allowed to have this miracle drug again.		May 8, 2017	12

Acne (Topical)	Acne	I started using benzoyl peroxide gel 5%, for my mild acne skin  at the first three days I felt some redness and itching  around acne areas  and also few tiny weak acne appeared around the affected areas but just after three days my skin started to improve and at the seventh day of using it, the acne had improved and my skin felt well and calmer.  I used the product at night after washing my face with a cleanser, I applied the gel only on my acne with a very thin layer. I recommend this product.	7	October 15, 2020	8
Acne (Topical)	Acne	Purchased this product for my 12 year old daughter who has moderate acne on her forehead. Used the facewash and can say saw amazing results after just a couple of uses. Her red inflamed spots calmed down considerably and she didn't seem to have any new out breaks.  Haven't had any bad side effects as yet but have been making sure she regularly moisturised with an oil free moisturiser and uses sun screen daily. I wish this product had been about when I was a teen.	9	September 29, 2020	5
Acne (Topical)	Acne	My daughter brought benzoyl peroxide cream this week and ended up with it burning her face and major swelling. Had to have injections of antihistamines and steroids. Not happy! This product needs to have warning signs on it to alert the customers of the dangerous of putting peroxide on your face!!!	1	September 18, 2020	4
Acne (Topical)	Acne	My daughter has been prescribed this and it caused horrible burns on her face.	1	August 10, 2020	4
Acne (Topical)	PanOxyl (benzoyl peroxide) for Acne	PanOxyl made my entire face swell up especially my eyes	3	June 10, 2020	4
Acne (Topical)	Acne	I am 24 and have struggled with acne for about 10 years. More recently, I have started getting large cystic acne at intervals (probably hormone related) which really impact my confidence. I used Duac as a teenager but was't a massive fan due to the bleaching effect and smell. However, bought a benzoyl peroxide treatment again to try when my skin is really bad. This helped to quickly reduce the size of the blemishes but I got a really sore, red rash on my neck even though I was not applying the product here. I have now bought some aloe to treat this and will continue to use the benzoyl peroxide to treat my worst breakouts. Fingers crossed the irritation subsides and the positive effects continue!	6	April 28, 2020	3
Acne (Topical)	Acne	This stuff really is amazing as all the reviews say! Have had some bad cystic acne lumps which have been sore and big. Put this gel on before bed and the next day the lump and redness has subsided considerably. Be aware though as most reviews state, put it on the spot only with a cotton bud as it dries your skin out a lot and use a very good moisturiser	10	March 8, 2020	11
Acne (Topical)	PanOxyl 10% Acne Foaming Wash (benzoyl peroxide) for Acne	Clears up skin rather quickly on face and on back. It helps with oily skin as well. It reduces whiteheads and blackheads also. Works great in combination with the OTC acne medication Differin gel.	9	February 28, 2020	4
Acne (Topical)	Acne	hi, I have had acne struggles in the past years of my teen age years. My mum use to buy me products for my skin, and end up wasting a lot of her money on products that never worked as my skin just instantly reacted so quick. But one day she gave me a product called Benzoyl Peroxide. Damn I was in love with it as I was so self conscious with my looks. I also brought myself the benzoyl peroxide soap. I recommend this product as I've been using it for five months now.	7	February 26, 2020	2
Acne (Topical)	Acne	I always had acne problems, like a normal teenager would. I struggled to find different products to get rid of the acne, I used everything you could possibly think of. Almost two years ago I found Top Care Benzoyl Peroxide 10%, and never stopped using it. I put it on 2x a day; day and overnight... I now use it with black soap, noxzema, Dr. Teals body lotion, and coconut oil. My skin is in the best state it’s been in since I hit purberty.	10	January 31, 2020	8
Acne (Topical)	Acne	When i first started using this it worked like magic, would clear up spots within days but you'll find just like any other acne treatment after a while your body just gets used to it and it becomes less effective.  I noticed after months of constant use it went from a few days to almost 2 weeks just for slight improvement, its easy to apply and drys up so its not like  sudocrem where you turn over and your face gets stuck to pillow lol.  If you haven't used this before definitely do, it will take a few days maybe weeks for it to start working it just varies person to person, make most of it because sadly your acne adapts to it and will slowly become useless but thats for every treatment. good luck.	5	January 11, 2020	5
Acne (Topical)	Acne	I’m a teenager and I’ve had hormonal acne for the past 2 years. Tried everything from topical creams and medication but nothing seemed to work. I bought benzoyl peroxide 3 days ago and my acne is literally gone just left with some scarring with is my fault for not leaving my spots alone. My face burnt a little bit but I applied too much so I recommend only applying a tiny bit because I didn’t realise how sensitive my skin actually was. This is the most effective product I have tried so far!	10	December 26, 2019	10
Acne (Topical)	Acne	I’ve struggled with acne for majority of my teenage years and into my now early 20s from a mixture of genetics, menstrual hormones and very oily skin. I have been using the benzoyl peroxide (10%) for 2 months now and I am seeing great results! I didn’t start noticing results until maybe about a month and a half into using it. It’s mild and doesn’t irritate my skin which is very sensitive. I use this along with clindamycin phosphate and retin A (for my acne scars/dark spots) which were prescribed to me from my doctor and she informed me it would take about 3 months to see full results and so far her timing is correct! I definitely recommend over things like Proactive, Biore, Epiduo, and the countless other things I’ve tried. Super affordable as well literally my only regret is not using it sooner	8	October 4, 2019	8
Acne (Topical)	Acne	I have been using benzoyl peroxide for two weeks  for my acne so it's probably too early to say, but so far I'm not seeing any results. The first 3 days or so were fine, but since then I've been breaking out almost constantly. Nothing too severe though and could be just bad timing, but it left me a bit discouraged. Will continue with it though at least for a couple of more weeks, and hope that it will get better. I started with a new moisturiser at the same time as I started with the benzoyl peroxide, so I guess that could be the cause for the breakouts as well.	5	August 22, 2019	4
Acne (Topical)	Acne	I have been struggling with acne for almost two years, it is four days since I started applying benzoyl peroxide, I apply thinly as prescribed and I can say my face doesn't have acne anymore.  No clogged pores. I am seeing this like a dream because it has been a real struggle for me on acne.	8	August 18, 2019	7
Acne (Topical)	Acne	Ok so this is the first time I've ever wrote a review on anything! So that just goes to show you how great this product works (benzyl peroxide 10%), I struggled with acne for years! Since I was about 13. I'm 23 now and I must say that this is life changing! I've tried everything on the market. From Accutane, Retin-A, home remedies & this is the only thing that worked for me! I highly recommend this product to anyone who's suffering through acne! But of course what works for me doesn't mean it'll work for you! acne free whoooo-hooooo!	10	June 13, 2019	16
Acne (Topical)	Oxy-10 (benzoyl peroxide) for Acne	Usually this product is fine but today I got a severe allergic reaction to it. My eyes have swollen up, my face felt hot and warm and burned. Very scary!	6	April 8, 2019	16
Acne (Topical)	Acne	I purchased benzoyl for my pre teen daughter, due to its amazing reviews, and affordable price. She started using it two night ago and we can already see a big improvement on her skin! I left it over night and her skin didn’t get irritated, which is a big plus. I recommend this product to anyone suffering from acne, it works much better than the expensive products.	10	February 1, 2019	9
Acne (Topical)	Acne	Literally AMAZING I had quite bad acne all on my t-zone (chin nose forehead). I have only been using this product for a few days but has really made a different the spots have gone down and most of the redness has gone and if I keep on using this my skin will hopefully be clear again!! I recommend this product to people with acne	8	November 2, 2018	11
Acne (Topical)	Acne	Bought the off brand from Walgreens, my face has swollen up, and within 12 hours I have multiple blisters and welts all over, this has lasted at least a month, worst thing I have ever bought, had to take benedryl and put hydrocortisone cream so I could even sleep, face was hot to the touch, had to go to work with a mask on my face, because makeup does not cover, and it burns.	1	October 28, 2018	4
Acne (Topical)	Acne	I have been using benzoyl peroxide 5% wash for a little over a month now. Overall I definitely seen an improvement since I’ve been using it. I also was prescribed doxycycline (pills) & clindamycin (facial wipes) one pill at night with dinner, wash my face twice and use wipes after when face is dry. I’ve seen a lot of reviews that haven’t been touching base on certain things. If your using this wash, cream, or gel it’s best that you continue to moisturize your face. I strongly recommend you use a Daily moisturizer with sunscreen. I’ve been using Olay products and I stick with just that. I do not wash my face with anything else but what my Dermentologist prescribe and I followed the directions. I this product is super good. But if not used correctly it can also harm your skin. 		October 9, 2018	5
Acne (Topical)	Acne	I was using this product topically on my skin morning and night for all of high school. It cleared up my extreme acne in a matter of days and was amazed. HOWEVER, at times My skin would be so stripped of oil that the edges of my mouth, eyes, and nose would crack (sometimes bleeding.) I would  apply coconut oil until they healed. These episodes were rare and my face was overall clearer, until few months ago. Suddenly within a day my entire face was red, itching, burning, peeling.  These didn’t stop for a month of only applying water, and pure vitamin E oil to stop the pain paired with antibiotics. This drug was my best frenemy, who I am finally saying goodbye to. I would recommend this to anyone, but beg them to know when to know to say when.	5	December 10, 2017	7
Acne (Topical)	Acne	This is by far the best medication available for acne. I had acne since past 2 years (Severe). I used benzoyl peroxide just for about a month and truly speaking...I don't even have a single acne on my face now it's all clear. Thanks to benzoyl peroxide. Do use it❤ I had tried almost everything and this is what really worked. Thumbs up!		November 23, 2017	20
Acne (Topical)	Acne	I am using BP 5% for a month now. First, I suffered from allergy then it became zits and it was painful. Benzoyl peroxide really works for it kills the bacteria. After my treatment I will continue using BP but decrease it to 2.5% and use it just 3x a week.Thanks to BP for it cleared my acne!		July 18, 2017	15
Acne (Topical)	BenzEFoam Ultra (benzoyl peroxide) for Acne	I am having acne on  back and face for over 7 years, i  tried everything ,and no help, until I got this product it cleared my skin within 2-3 days, I was the happiest teenager ever, however we couldn't keep buying  it since it cost waaaay to much money and my insurance does not cover any of it which really is bad	10	April 26, 2017	16

My mum use to buy me products for my skin, and end up wasting a lot of her money on products that never worked as my skin just instantly reacted so quick. But one day she gave me a product called Benzoyl Peroxide. Damn I was in love with it as I was so self conscious with my looks. I also brought myself the benzoyl peroxide soap. I recommend this product as I've been using it for five months now.	7	February 26, 2020	2
Acne Wash (Topical)	Acne	I always had acne problems, like a normal teenager would. I struggled to find different products to get rid of the acne, I used everything you could possibly think of. Almost two years ago I found Top Care Benzoyl Peroxide 10%, and never stopped using it. I put it on 2x a day; day and overnight... I now use it with black soap, noxzema, Dr. Teals body lotion, and coconut oil. My skin is in the best state it’s been in since I hit purberty.	10	January 31, 2020	8
Acne Wash (Topical)	Acne	When i first started using this it worked like magic, would clear up spots within days but you'll find just like any other acne treatment after a while your body just gets used to it and it becomes less effective.  I noticed after months of constant use it went from a few days to almost 2 weeks just for slight improvement, its easy to apply and drys up so its not like  sudocrem where you turn over and your face gets stuck to pillow lol.  If you haven't used this before definitely do, it will take a few days maybe weeks for it to start working it just varies person to person, make most of it because sadly your acne adapts to it and will slowly become useless but thats for every treatment. good luck.	5	January 11, 2020	5
Acne Wash (Topical)	Acne	I’m a teenager and I’ve had hormonal acne for the past 2 years. Tried everything from topical creams and medication but nothing seemed to work. I bought benzoyl peroxide 3 days ago and my acne is literally gone just left with some scarring with is my fault for not leaving my spots alone. My face burnt a little bit but I applied too much so I recommend only applying a tiny bit because I didn’t realise how sensitive my skin actually was. This is the most effective product I have tried so far!	10	December 26, 2019	10
Acne Wash (Topical)	Acne	I’ve struggled with acne for majority of my teenage years and into my now early 20s from a mixture of genetics, menstrual hormones and very oily skin. I have been using the benzoyl peroxide (10%) for 2 months now and I am seeing great results! I didn’t start noticing results until maybe about a month and a half into using it. It’s mild and doesn’t irritate my skin which is very sensitive. I use this along with clindamycin phosphate and retin A (for my acne scars/dark spots) which were prescribed to me from my doctor and she informed me it would take about 3 months to see full results and so far her timing is correct! I definitely recommend over things like Proactive, Biore, Epiduo, and the countless other things I’ve tried. Super affordable as well literally my only regret is not using it sooner	8	October 4, 2019	8
Acne Wash (Topical)	Acne	I have been using benzoyl peroxide for two weeks  for my acne so it's probably too early to say, but so far I'm not seeing any results. The first 3 days or so were fine, but since then I've been breaking out almost constantly. Nothing too severe though and could be just bad timing, but it left me a bit discouraged. Will continue with it though at least for a couple of more weeks, and hope that it will get better. I started with a new moisturiser at the same time as I started with the benzoyl peroxide, so I guess that could be the cause for the breakouts as well.	5	August 22, 2019	4
Acne Wash (Topical)	Acne	I have been struggling with acne for almost two years, it is four days since I started applying benzoyl peroxide, I apply thinly as prescribed and I can say my face doesn't have acne anymore.  No clogged pores. I am seeing this like a dream because it has been a real struggle for me on acne.	8	August 18, 2019	7
Acne Wash (Topical)	Acne	Ok so this is the first time I've ever wrote a review on anything! So that just goes to show you how great this product works (benzyl peroxide 10%), I struggled with acne for years! Since I was about 13. I'm 23 now and I must say that this is life changing! I've tried everything on the market. From Accutane, Retin-A, home remedies & this is the only thing that worked for me! I highly recommend this product to anyone who's suffering through acne! But of course what works for me doesn't mean it'll work for you! acne free whoooo-hooooo!	10	June 13, 2019	16
Acne Wash (Topical)	Oxy-10 (benzoyl peroxide) for Acne	Usually this product is fine but today I got a severe allergic reaction to it. My eyes have swollen up, my face felt hot and warm and burned. Very scary!	6	April 8, 2019	16
Acne Wash (Topical)	Acne	I purchased benzoyl for my pre teen daughter, due to its amazing reviews, and affordable price. She started using it two night ago and we can already see a big improvement on her skin! I left it over night and her skin didn’t get irritated, which is a big plus. I recommend this product to anyone suffering from acne, it works much better than the expensive products.	10	February 1, 2019	9
Acne Wash (Topical)	Acne	Literally AMAZING I had quite bad acne all on my t-zone (chin nose forehead). I have only been using this product for a few days but has really made a different the spots have gone down and most of the redness has gone and if I keep on using this my skin will hopefully be clear again!! I recommend this product to people with acne	8	November 2, 2018	11
Acne Wash (Topical)	Acne	Bought the off brand from Walgreens, my face has swollen up, and within 12 hours I have multiple blisters and welts all over, this has lasted at least a month, worst thing I have ever bought, had to take benedryl and put hydrocortisone cream so I could even sleep, face was hot to the touch, had to go to work with a mask on my face, because makeup does not cover, and it burns.	1	October 28, 2018	4
Acne Wash (Topical)	Acne	I have been using benzoyl peroxide 5% wash for a little over a month now. Overall I definitely seen an improvement since I’ve been using it. I also was prescribed doxycycline (pills) & clindamycin (facial wipes) one pill at night with dinner, wash my face twice and use wipes after when face is dry. I’ve seen a lot of reviews that haven’t been touching base on certain things. If your using this wash, cream, or gel it’s best that you continue to moisturize your face. I strongly recommend you use a Daily moisturizer with sunscreen. I’ve been using Olay products and I stick with just that. I do not wash my face with anything else but what my Dermentologist prescribe and I followed the directions. I this product is super good. But if not used correctly it can also harm your skin.

Acne Wash (Topical)	Acne	I was using this product topically on my skin morning and night for all of high school. It cleared up my extreme acne in a matter of days and was amazed. HOWEVER, at times My skin would be so stripped of oil that the edges of my mouth, eyes, and nose would crack (sometimes bleeding.) I would  apply coconut oil until they healed. These episodes were rare and my face was overall clearer, until few months ago. Suddenly within a day my entire face was red, itching, burning, peeling.  These didn’t stop for a month of only applying water, and pure vitamin E oil to stop the pain paired with antibiotics. This drug was my best frenemy, who I am finally saying goodbye to. I would recommend this to anyone, but beg them to know when to know to say when.	5	December 10, 2017	7
Acne Wash (Topical)	Acne	This is by far the best medication available for acne. I had acne since past 2 years (Severe). I used benzoyl peroxide just for about a month and truly speaking...I don't even have a single acne on my face now it's all clear. Thanks to benzoyl peroxide. Do use it❤ I had tried almost everything and this is what really worked. Thumbs up!		November 23, 2017	20
Acne Wash (Topical)	Acne	I am using BP 5% for a month now. First, I suffered from allergy then it became zits and it was painful. Benzoyl peroxide really works for it kills the bacteria. After my treatment I will continue using BP but decrease it to 2.5% and use it just 3x a week.Thanks to BP for it cleared my acne!		July 18, 2017	15
Acne Wash (Topical)	BenzEFoam Ultra (benzoyl peroxide) for Acne	I am having acne on  back and face for over 7 years, i  tried everything ,and no help, until I got this product it cleared my skin within 2-3 days, I was the happiest teenager ever, however we couldn't keep buying  it since it cost waaaay to much money and my insurance does not cover any of it which really is bad	10	April 26, 2017	16

Acrivastine and pseudoephedrine	Semprex-D (acrivastine / pseudoephedrine) for Allergic Rhinitis	Please start manufacturing this drug it the only drug that work for chronic life long sufferers of environmental allergies. Xyzal, Allegra, zyrtec do not compare and Singulair has a high rate of side effects and doesn't really work.	10	April 9, 2021	0
Acrivastine and pseudoephedrine	Semprex-D (acrivastine / pseudoephedrine) for Allergic Rhinitis	This is the only antihistamine decongestant that works for my daughter. We were introduced to it when she was 8 years old. It was a God send. Before Semprex-D either the medicine she was prescribed made her horribly cranky or it didn’t work.  She has been using this for 22 years. It also works better then any over the counter or prescription for myself and my adult son. None of us have experienced any negative side effects.   Please bring it back. Many people have never heard of it. Bring it back and advertise.	10	October 12, 2020	2
Acrivastine and pseudoephedrine	Semprex-D (acrivastine / pseudoephedrine) for Allergic Rhinitis	Yes, Semprex is the only drug that cleared my nose up.  Probably why is was pricey.  Let's remake this product quickly, but lower the price.  This is a fine product, reproduce it please ?!?  Best regards,	10	September 29, 2020	1
Acrivastine and pseudoephedrine	Semprex-D (acrivastine / pseudoephedrine) for Allergic Rhinitis	Please start producing this medicine in the U.S. again. I’ve been trying all other options but none of the allergy medications are as effective as Acrivastine. I’ve been on this medicine for 25 years and it’s how I’m able to live in the great state of Tennessee.	10	September 10, 2020	3
Acrivastine and pseudoephedrine	Semprex-D (acrivastine / pseudoephedrine) for Allergic Rhinitis	I have been using Semprex D for well over 25 years and it is the only drug that controls my allergies. All of the other drugs either don't work or give me side effects that are extremely unpleasant like stomach cramps and diarrhea. Now, even if I can find Semprex D, the price is around $215 for a month's supply with insurance. There is no generic for this drug, but it is sold over the counter in Britain for practically nothing. I don't understand why Endo Pharmaceuticals is penalizing their American consumers this way when most of its operations and management are located in Delaware. Why can't someone produce a generic of this drug and get it on the market or lower the cost of the brand name and make it obtainable for people in America at a reasonable cost?	10	August 13, 2020	3
Acrivastine and pseudoephedrine	Semprex-D (acrivastine / pseudoephedrine) for Allergic Rhinitis	Been on Semprex-D for so long. Effective.  None of others work. I am so congested even with nasal sprays.   Don’t know what to do since it was discontinued	10	August 10, 2019	2
Acrivastine and pseudoephedrine	Semprex-D (acrivastine / pseudoephedrine) for Allergic Rhinitis	This is the only antihistamine/ decongestant that gives me relief from allergic rhinitis , stops itching eyes and helps with congestion. Nothing over the counter even touches my symptoms. Wish one day there will be a safe generic.	10	July 23, 2019	4
Acrivastine and pseudoephedrine	Semprex-D (acrivastine / pseudoephedrine) for Allergic Rhinitis	Semprex D is the only effective medication I've had that works for me. I have tried all other brands and generics with-the decongestant in it and none of others worked. I am having a problem now locating a pharmacy that has it on stock and would love love to be able buy it I don't tolerate  others well when I can't find it and end up having a cold and has even turned into pneumonia.	10	June 4, 2019	2
Acrivastine and pseudoephedrine	Semprex-D (acrivastine / pseudoephedrine) for Allergic Rhinitis	I have been on semprex-d for over ten years and it is the only medicine that works for me I hope they don't discontinue it because it's very effective medicine	10	March 19, 2019	7
Actemra	Rheumatoid Arthritis	I am in my third month is a totally change of life , my usual life is back	9	January 22, 2021	6
Actemra	Rheumatoid Arthritis	Actemra has worked very well for my RA - the first 18 months I was self injecting the 162 ml shots, and all was well. I often would go three weeks between shots rather than two. I just was switched a few months ago to the infusion once a month due to a different insurance. I now have hemolytic anemia, which is a first for me in a 42 year case of seropositive RA. So, will find out what the doc says soon, and may need to change amounts of the infusion, or switch to something else. Since I REALLY dislike the once a month infusion for an hour, I would love to find something else that doesn't require that.	10	November 13, 2020	6
Actemra	Rheumatoid Arthritis	Started taking Actemra 5 months ago for RA after trying 4 other biologics. The Actemra had helped dramatically with lowering my CRP levels (which have been incredibly high for over 2 years) however, I now have intense stiffness and joint pain which never seems to dissipate. The pain in my feet has increased to a point where I can hardly walk. Additionally, I've developed iron, vitamin, inflammation, aplastic, & hemolytic anemia. I have decided to stop this drug and switch  back to one of my previous biologics which didn't help with the inflammation but, at least my pain wasn't so extreme and I wasn't dealing with the anemia.	5	September 25, 2020	9
Actemra	Rheumatoid Arthritis	I did one Actemra injection.  After injection I could not walk straight and was so tired.  Thought it was side effect.  Woke up with swollen face and eyes!  Wheezing in my chest. Called my doctor he said prednisone and Benadryl.  It’s been 4 days and I am still so tired and nauseous	1	August 17, 2020	12
Actemra	Rheumatoid Arthritis	Nothing seemed to work until my specialist put me on Actemra. Has been a God-send. All my swelling and pain is gone.	10	March 11, 2020	17
Actemra	Giant Cell Arteritis	I have been on Actemra for 11 months and so far I have been doing very well - no GCA symptoms have reoccurred and my blood work has been excellent.	10	December 19, 2019	34
Actemra	Rheumatoid Arthritis	It put me in the hospital for 9 days, 2 weeks after taking infusion. My lower right leg swelled and I started having blisters pop up all over, like softball sized! They finally figured it out, it was a chemical eruption from actemra infusion! Could have lost my leg! Worst experience ever! 2 weeks I'm I'm still bedridden cannot walk on it and blisters are still forming.  This medication is nothing to mess around with! Wish I could post a picture with this message!	1	November 29, 2019	28
Actemra	Rheumatoid Arthritis	Worst biologic experience yet! This is a weekly injection and I had severe nausea on this. My rheumatologist thinks it was more of an interaction on this and my methotrexate (although MTX has caused me any issues in the nearly 3 years I’ve been doing those injections). This was like horrible morning sickness all day everyday—I lost 6 lbs the first week I was on Actemra due to nausea.  Week 3, I woke up the day I was to do injection #3 (which I do at bedtime) and my face was puffy, my legs were COMPLETELY swollen to the point where it was difficult to bend without discomfort at hip and knees, my belly was swollen almost to the point of rigidity. My doctor wanted to see me rather than send me to the ER and turns out this is a rare side effect. Stopping immediately and had to go on diuretics to help reduce swelling. Risk of stomach and bowel rupture was a concern since I’ve already had sepsis after an undetected appendix rupture several years ago.	1	November 21, 2019	16
Actemra	Rheumatoid Arthritis	I have been on Actemera for almost 2 years. Before taking it my blood levels were all over the place and was physically drained. Since then receiving infusions every 5 wks. and have had good results and blood work is MUCH improved! I have been lucky to NOT experience the side efforts I've read about. I have also heard from my Dr. that 30% of patients can develop a resistance to the drug. I am doing well but my dr would like me to do better. Might try switching me off in time. I initially I have tried prednisone and embryle with no results. We shall see.	8	October 13, 2019	13
Actemra	Rheumatoid Arthritis	"I have received 3 months of IV Infusion of Actemra because my Dr promised me this would be the ""ONE"" after trying so many.  I have needed prednisone everyday going on 10 months!  Doses as high as 20mg for months!  Now have the dreaded side effects from all that prednisone in my body! What's next? Why bother putting all this poisonous biologicals in my body if none of them work? Tried some that work on TNF cells and Actemra that works on IL-6 cells.  Even tried one that work on JAK cells. I have an Appointment for my 4th month Actemra infusion this Wednesday.  I will be letting Dr know this will be the LAST one if nothing still does not change!  No RA drug is helping relieve this every single day nightmare flare!  The only thing that does work is the prednisone!!  But cannot be on that forever either.  What do I do?"	1	September 16, 2019	37
Actemra	Rheumatoid Arthritis	I started Roactemra  (tocilizumab brand in the UK) 4 months ago for RA, previously been on Humira and enbrel which did not work enough. I also tried metotextrate but can't seem to tolerate it, so then I got roactemra. Started to work after 3rd injection and has been working very well to control my RA. However I now experience a feeling of not getting enough air, get very fatigued and feel weak, also some dizziness and headache approx 2-3 days after injection. So IDK if I can keep on taking this drug. I'm not even sure if it is Roactemra causing this but it I might have to go off medication to find out, since I can't really function in my daily life - meaning I have no stiffness or joint pain, but can't breathe properly so I cant enjoy it.	7	August 18, 2019	23
Actemra	Giant Cell Arteritis	Actemra works well. No side effects recognized. Blood work back normal after first dose. Eliminated GCA (giant cell arteritis) headache.	8	March 5, 2019	51
Actemra	Rheumatoid Arthritis	Did me no good and stopped the medication 		December 31, 2018	17
Actemra	Rheumatoid Arthritis	Actemra eases my RA symptoms for approximately 2.5 weeks from a 9 to a 6 on a scale of 10 for pain, stiffness and fatigue. The week prior to an infusion it creeps back in more and more, day by day and takes a few days to get it back to a 6 after the infusion. I use Celebrex and Advil to deal with it, but my Rheumatologist has recently started me back on methotrexate with the Actemra infusions. I have taken almost every drug for this disease over a 26 year period. None of them have put me in a remission and the disease has progressed despite taking them all compliantly.	5	March 13, 2018	32
Actemra	Rheumatoid Arthritis	 I told my doctor to take me off this drug after I found out there was a class action law suit developing after several deaths		January 8, 2018	40
Actemra	Rheumatoid Arthritis	Helped greatly but still suffered terrible fatigue and pain along with upset stomach and weight gain	7	January 7, 2018	23
Actemra	Rheumatoid Arthritis	I previously gave this drug a 10, but after the 11th month, I had a heart attack and a week after that two stomach perforations causing me to vomit blood.  Although Actemra helped my RA, my doctor immediately discontinued the drug after the heart attack.  After the upper GI bleed, my doctor permanently discontinued Actemra due to the serious nature of the side effects.  I think the drug needs more study and trials to determine if it is safe.  I would not take it again.	3	December 25, 2017	40
Actemra	Rheumatoid Arthritis	I had some positive experience from receiving Actemra . However about 1 year ago I suddenly developed pulmonary hypertension and RT sided heart failure, suddenly developed severe dyspnea, chest pain, chest & throat pressure, unable to lay flat or symptoms worsened. I was referred to a cardiologist who performed blood work. The BNP result being 982, a chemical stress test, a right sided heart cath that showed high pressure in the right side of the heart. I was referred to Dr who specializes in pulmonary HTN. After about 6 months he ordered repeat testing, Where we discovered the pulmonary HTN had subsided. Normal heart pressures and BNP decreased to approximately 200. No other RA meds taken since.	5	November 8, 2017	20
Actemra	Rheumatoid Arthritis	I have had RA for over 30 yrs. It was one of the most efficient ones I have taken although I developed septic shock within the last 4 months from a local wound and the medication had reduced my immune system to the point of this terrifying experience.		October 20, 2017	24
Actemra	Rheumatoid Arthritis	I was diagnosed with RA in 1987 after giving birth. Since then I have tried almost every drug available and my RA continues to ravage my joints. Actemra is working pretty well but I have had to go off of it for a time because my white blood count dropped too low. I've been back on it for almost a year, I had to reduce my methotrexate in order to keep the WBC up and take 3mg of folic acid daily and 1mg of prednisone with frequent use of meloxicam. I am on Medicare. I can not get assistance for the drug that worked well, Simponi. J&J did not offer assistance and I could not afford the high copay. The best thing about Actemra is the compassionate patient assistance team. They are always caring and helpful when I call them.	8	May 16, 2017	23
Actemra	Rheumatoid Arthritis	The only drug that works for me	10	April 18, 2017	18
Actemra	Rheumatoid Arthritis	I took the first dose of Actemra and felt a little dizzy but that did not last long.  My stiffness was reduced and for the first time in two years felt like myself again. The only problem is that my lip was slightly swollen but went away in about two days. The medicine last for about 4-5 days then I started having severe pain in my joints especially my elbows and shoulders. I had to take pain medication which did not help much.  Overall I love this medication and I can't wait for my weekly injection.	7	March 3, 2017	26
Acthar Gel, H.P.	Multiple Sclerosis	This is the 2nd time I have had to do a dose of Acthar and I would have to say it is so much better than the medrol IV that I was doing.  I was allergic to the other and having to sit for a hr and a half for the infusion which was a pain.  This is simple and I can do it myself. It helps with my relapse and my insurance covers the cost!  (big help)		May 19, 2018	3
Acticlate	Acne	DO NOT TAKE THIS. I was prescribed Acticlate in 2015 and took it for about a month for my acne. It gave me permanent BLIND SPOTS. It’s been 5 years and they’re still present. I have read other people who this has happened to. Look up “doxycycline blindness”. Obviously medications are different for everyone, but I was perfectly healthy and not expecting to go blind.	1	May 16, 2020	26
Acticlate	Acne	I’ve been taking a 75 mg dosage for about 6-8 months. It cleared my face but I’ve noticed several side effects that developed over time including weight loss, strange thoughts, mild anxiety and mild depression.	6	November 28, 2018	3
Acticlate	Acne	My son started this after developing cystic acne. Within 4 months of use and monthly facials we thought it was a blessing. His face was clear and almost no traces of acne.  However by month 6 he begin having severe body aches, lethergic, fevers and losing weight. Dermatologist said this medication would not cause these side effects. After seeing a rheumatologist, neurological, several and I mean several ER visits we could not find a diagnosis for his severe issues. By month 10 he had lost 15 lbs, countless days of missed school, let alone the pain he was suffering my son decided to stop the medication. Doctors all said it would not be the cause of his symptoms. Could it be coincident that a month after stopping this medication he no longer had body pain, 2 months later he regained his energy.? Unfortunately he hasn't been able to gain his weight back which is fine at least I got my son back. I won't say this doesn't work but the un known side effects were not worth it. Not for my son.	2	August 7, 2018	10
Acticlate	Acne	Well well well...so I started this product a little over a month ago and I'll tell you first because I wish someone would have told me, for the LADIES it is a antibacterial drug so you most like WILL HAVE A YEAST INFECTION! lol so that's first, Next this is for men and women, IF NOT TAKEN ON A FULL STOMACH YOU WILL THROW UP! and last but def not least, it will break you out even more like severely more but I heard that that's a good thing, its suppose to get all the bacteria from the inside and push it out and then your face will get better and that seems to be happening to me. I get a few pimples here and there but nothing like I use to get, hopefully after my 30day supply is gone I'll be able to STAY OFF IT		January 1, 2018	5
Acticlate	Acne	I've been on for one week now, 75mg a day/3months. I have for the most part always had clear skin all of my life w/ an occasional pimple. I'm 27 and just this year I've been breaking out, cystic acne out of no where. I finally went to the derm after everything else failed. Like I said, it's been a week and I can tell you this medicine is tricky. I have some side effects, abnominal pain, severe headaches, couple others, but I see a such a difference! The stuff stuck in my skin is coming out, it's not drying my skin like trentinoin did. I've never been on medicine like this so take it at night before bed to avoid feeling some of the symptoms. Avoid the sun+ any drinking when on this, it will make you vomit!	7	June 17, 2017	7
Actidose	Gas	I have used activated charcoal from a number of different companies. I use it personally to treat excessive gas when it becomes frequent and stinky, but I also give it to my mixed breed dog when Famotidine doesn’t seem to help enough. She seems to have IBS, poor thing. I have her on a homemade diet. It is a Godsend.	10	February 25, 2021	0

Active FE	PreserVision AREDS 2 (multivitamin with minerals)	I was prescribed this for my eye condition. I purchased two bottles - 140 count soft gels, preservison.  After taking one of the pill I became very nauseous, sharp stomach pains, high temperature, sharp pains in my joints, even my ankles.  Now I cannot get in touch with bausch and Lomb to inform then if my problem with their product.  This is a very dangerous drug and the FDA should step in and check on them.	1	April 25, 2021	0

Active FE	PreserVision AREDS 2 (multivitamin with minerals)	Have a cast iron stomach so no problems there although I did cut out my other zinc supplement just in case.  I find I have to take it in the morning because it makes me hyper - any later and I can't sleep. I have found I'm more tired, vision is blurry, more floaters, and very VERY dry eyes - to the point that I can't support my contacts (that I have worn for 40 years with no problems).  The PreserVision is the only brand that does this, the one I used previously (I forget the brand) was fine.  It's only Vit C & E and some zinc and lutein so I don't understand why PreserVision is so much worse than another. Disappointed and won't take anymore.	1	February 5, 2021	11
Active FE	PreserVision AREDS 2 (multivitamin with minerals)	Have been taking AREDS2 for over three years. One pill twice a day WITH A MEAL.

Took 1 in the morning and 1 at night time .Woke up throwing up and hot vapors and hot flashes. Called ambulance, thinking she was having a stroke. Paramedics took her vitals. Her blood pressure had skyrocketed. They lowered BP with her meds and nausea and dizziness persisted for few more hours. Only new med she had taken was this Aerds2. We read the side effects and sure enough she had all of them. Very scary - she will not be taking them again.	1	January 2, 2021	14

Active FE	PreserVision AREDS 2 (multivitamin with minerals)	As my husband takes a lot of medicines it was hard to tell which started his thankfully past illness.  He started getting mouth ulcers.  We went to the ER sent him home though it was canker sores and would go away.  After that he became dehydrated and nauseous, finally in hospital again for 6 days diagnosed with diverticulitis.  I couldn't find the correlation until I was reading these reviews.  He was taking these 2 times a day for 2 weeks before onset.  Again not sure yet if these caused it but to  be safe, than sorry.  Throwing out and appointment with eye doctor coming up.	3	November 12, 2020	7
Active FE	PreserVision AREDS 2 (multivitamin with minerals)	My old aunt swore by the recommended PreserVision after a year ago of Cataract surgery. Great improvement in her experience. I did not have the same experience. After two days of 4 tablets I experienced an awful headache behind my right eye. I never get headaches, but I am 55 and thought, hmmm, it couldn’t hurt to take them. Then after a couple weeks of on and off right eye headaches, it dawned on me, perhaps it was the new supplement. I stopped taking them to see, and sure enough, no more headaches. Everyone seems to have different reactions.Good luck!	1	October 24, 2020	12
Active FE	PreserVision AREDS 2 (multivitamin with minerals)	My ophthalmologist recommended that I take these vitamins to slow down any potential worsening of my macular degeneration, in the future. I had been taking Ocuvite 50+ but he said that there had been some studies for the Areds and that he felt I should switch. I immediately noticed that they made me nauseous even though I was only taking one pill  but found that the nausea was less severe if I took the pill with a meal. After a few weeks,  (at the age of 75) I also started getting frequent hot flashes and night sweats, something I had never had before.  I am also having severe stomach cramps.  I think that I shall stop this pill for a few weeks and then try again.	6	October 20, 2020	25
Active FE	PreserVision AREDS 2 (multivitamin with minerals)	Am I the only person experiencing sciatica when taking Areds 2 ?  Have tried it twice, replaced it with Vitalux advanced twice and had severe sciatica each time.  And each time it took three to four days to recede after stopping taking them.  Doctor totally unreceptive : he's never heard that before.  My experience doesn't count...  The first time I had that problem, I didn't link it to Areds 2.  I did have a problem sleeping and also had to get up to go to the bathroom three, even four times a night.   These problems disappeared when I stopped taking Areds 2.  I have macular degeneration and am looking for a substitute that will help, without the side effects.		October 19, 2020	25
Active FE	PreserVision AREDS 2 (multivitamin with minerals)	Eye dr. suggested taking 2x/day with meals, saying I had start of Macular Degeneration.  At first, I didn't associate the reflux, stomach upset, blurred vision, difficulty focusing vision, increased eye fatigue that I was experiencing.  I decreased to 1x/day.  Not much better.  I skipped a day or two and didn't experience the increased blurred vision  upset & reflux.  BTW - on a recent blood test, they erroneously tested Vit E - which is in PreserVision AREDS 2 - result was off the chart way beyond max. range.  I questioned eye dr. if level is too high; he had no comment on it.   I've read doses greater than 400 units/day can cause blurred vision, dizziness, nausea, unusual tiredness or weakness.   Excess Vit E supplements can cause an increase risk of bleeding in the brain (hemorrhagic stroke) -- A waste of good money, I think.	1	October 15, 2020	13

Active FE	PreserVision AREDS 2 (multivitamin with minerals)	It is most likely the zinc causing nausea, but could also be vitamin A. I have a very sensitive digestive system and I can take Lutein 40mg, Zeaxanthin, Vitamin C 1000mg, and E with NO issues.

Active FE	PreserVision AREDS 2 (multivitamin with minerals)	I was advised by my Retina Specialist to start taking AREDS 2 last month. I have been taking two per day of the mini gels for six weeks. I have never experienced such severe constipation. I've also had sudden onset of nausea. I discussed with my doctor today at my post op visit. He was unaware of there being anything in the AREDS 2 vitamin that would cause this, but was very understanding of the fact that everyone's reaction could be different. Since it doesn't agree with me, he suggest I stop taking. Now that I've found and read these reviews I feel confident that PreverVision AREDS 2 has caused the problems I'm having and I'm not alone as to the problems they cause.	1	September 16, 2020	33

Active FE	PreserVision AREDS 2 (multivitamin with minerals)	Very negative experience while taking this drug.  I made the decision to only take 1 pill a day to start.  From the start I had nausea,  each day the nausea grow worse.  After about 3 days I started having hot flashes,  mostly occurring at night.  I still felt I needed to give the medication a chance,  for my body to adjust.  After about 2 weeks nausea was less.  I then decided to start taking the recommended dose of 1 in the morning n 1 at night. I was unable to tolerate the increase,  more nausea accompanied with heartburn.  After 5 days I went back to 1 pill a day.   I really did not feel well since I started taking this medication.  Waves of nausea,  lethargic, constipated,  tried to convince myself that I would eventually adjust to the medication. Anyway the final straw,  after being on the medication was the itchy red rash that started on my arms.  Spread up and down both arms,  my mouth and tongue had a burning sensation. Stopped medication.  After 3 days rash has improved.	1	April 26, 2018	52

I did and lost that too the same way Called the doctor and he said take another with food and sit upright for at least 30 minutes. He said that if I vomited that one as well, just stop. I did and vomited that one out as well. I stopped taking it. I continued to vomit and felt nauseated for over a month, then I started to get a deep pain in my groin at the top of my legs and upper thighs. It's now 4 months later and my deep groin and upper thigh pain continue but are finally easing. I'm never touching these bisphosphonates again. Awful stuff!	1	June 22, 2018	53
Actonel	Osteoporosis	I had an over active parathyroid. It was sucking the calcium out of my bones. It affected me in my hips to where I could hardly walk. My doctor finally put me on Actonel before I was supposed to have surgery to remove the parathyroid. Within a couple of weeks, my hips stopped hurting. I was taking the dosage of once a week. My one frustration was the doctor not putting me on it sooner when I was starting to hurt.	10	May 19, 2018	30
Actos	Diabetes, Type 2	I was on Actos a couple of months. My sugar levels improved just slightly but I also put on about 12 pounds within that time frame. I had a bit of hair loss and had terrible swelling of my feet and legs which I didn’t normally have an issue with. I was not thrilled about starting this to begin with because of the awful side effects ( A BIG list of them) but my doctor wanted me to try it!  Too many serious side effects for me! I just had her switch me to Glipizide. Too many meds to try without going through all of that and being miserable. Please research it if you are thinking about trying it!	1	March 28, 2021	6
Actos	Diabetes, Type 2	I took this medicine for around a month and a half and it did nothing for my sugar levels. It caused a 15 pound weight gain. I stopped taking it after reading the serious side effects it can cause. Why take something that is going to make me worse off than I already am?	1	February 1, 2021	13
Actos	Diabetes, Type 2	Took Actos prescribed by VA doctor, now because of this, I have got stage 4 bladder cancer. It took 4 years and 36 treatments to get in remission. Actos is banned in some countries except USA. Yet the VA still prescribe it. Someone must be getting kickbacks, wither the FDA or VA in my opinion.		October 13, 2019	28
Actos	Diabetes, Type 2	I was on this pill for about 2 years gained about 40 pounds and also had really bad muscle pain. I took myself off of it so far have lost close too 20 pounds and muscle are feeling so much better.  These pills the doctors give me freak me out. All the side effects are so bad.

Actos	Diabetes, Type 2	Worked well at first. Now I get 200 plus readings when I wake up.	5	March 26, 2017	31
Acular	Postoperative Ocular Inflammation	I used acular as prescribed after first cataract operation with no after effects. Unfortunately, when using it, as prescribed, after second operation, I had an allergic reaction. I am seriously allergic to aspirin and Acular states that it is unsuitable for People who are aspirin allergic. There must be an alternative that surgeons could prescribe.	1	November 27, 2020	1
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	Went into the ER on Friday April 23 for chest and left arm pain, was given a Toradol injection in my left arm, burned like anything, kind of like 3 bees stung me. It eased the pain for a little, from about a 10 to a 7 in pain level , it is now Sunday and I still feel the stinging sensation in my arm and the pain has gone down all the way to my left rib cage,  now, my chest is just fine, but now I have this damn pain from the injection. I have been placing a cold ice pack and it helps a little , at night pain gets worse where I had the injection.  I honestly don't recommend Toradol it hurts like anything.	1	April 26, 2021	0
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	Woke up with severe stomach, flank, and left sided back pain. About 5 days of horrific pain scheduled doctor's visit. He then sent me to the ER. Was kept in the ER for over 8 hours. Given IV meds that got rid of pain for a short period of time, but made me itch horribly. Went back to my PCP and was told I had diverticulitis and possibly triggered my degenerate disc disease  Given antibiotics and an injection of toradol.  Heavens above my pain is gone. Prescription toradol every 6 hours PRN. I am so grateful. This has got to be a wonder drug. Hope I can heal and pain stays at bay	10	April 25, 2021	0
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I went into the ER because of a seven day long migraine. They gave me a shot of Toradol. Within one hour my entire abdomen was painfully heaving and cramping about every 1 to 2 minutes. For the first five days I couldn’t eat, and I couldn’t sit down, because sitting made it worse. So I paced my house until I was so exhausted that I could nap. Then I would wake up in the middle of the night and continue to pace until I was so exhausted I could go back to sleep again.   That severe heaving and cramping continued for five straight weeks. It took three different medication‘s to get it to stop.  It was the most torturous time of my entire life. I could barely sleep, and I couldn’t work.  Now, I can’t even take Advil. It causes the same response. (Before the Toradol I took Advil all the time with positive results.)	1	April 21, 2021	0
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Toradol IM (ketorolac) for Pain	I have arachnoiditis, which is inflammation of the arachnoid layer of the covering of the spinal cord. I have 24/7 intractable pain for which I am on injectable dilaudid. When my pain flares even the dilaudid doesn’t work. Enter Toredol which saves my life. I inject 30 mg at home every other day when I’m flaring. Can’t take more than that because it is bad for your GI tract if you take too long. It is a God send.	10	March 24, 2021	0
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	Went to the ER for awful lower abdominal pain. Was given Toradol intravenously and my pain did not go away. I felt no different in terms of pain. I did get a little sleep but that is it. ☹️	1	March 14, 2021	0
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	If you have Eosinophilic esophagitis (EOE)....DO NOT TAKE OR ACCEPT THIS DRUG!!!! I went into the ER for arm & chest pain. (No heart attack...I believe it was my EOE causing spasming) The dr didn’t bat an eye when I told him I have EOE. I got the injection form & right off the bat started having issues with it. It also did diddly squat for the pain that I went in for.  I told the dr I wasn’t feeling right (sick to my stomach & dizzy at the time). He took my oxygen level & then gave me my discharge papers. That night, stomach pain. The next day, stomach pain & my body felt super fidgety on the inside. The next day, back in the ER because my stomach pain was getting worse along with my tremors. 5 days later, I’m still having tremors. My stomach is still hurting.  Going off the side effect list, I’ve had quite a few of the reactions listed. This is definitely a no go for me ever again!!!!! I went in the ER for one issue & came out with another.	1	March 12, 2021	0
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Pain	This medicine is so amazing the way it blocks the pain receptors. Incredible job creating this! This medication is a God send!	10	February 21, 2021	0
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	Went to Urgent Care for back pain. The Toradol did not work. The pain did not lessen at all. What a waste of money	1	February 18, 2021	2
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	OMG this is THE BEST pain reliever I’ve had. It even worked better than the IV fentanyl that was ordered following a shoulder surgery. If I could take it every day, I would, but it’s dangerous, and the restrictions are for patient safety. But if it’s an option for pain relief, I’ll take it over a narcotic any day.	10	February 15, 2021	6
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I have Ehlers Danlos Syndrome (EDS) but currently have an infected tooth. (Tooth pain is the worst pain possible imo) Pain so bad, beats per minute was 168. Went to ER, Dr rx Toradol. Never had it as am allergic to NSAIDS. (not even sure if its ok for me?) A few minutes after it was administrated via IV, I started having a severe headache along with pain down my neck. It did absolutely nothing to lower the excruciating tooth pain either. I'm on long term pain meds for my EDS (10+ years) I assumed my meds weren't working due to the bad infection. Was sent home from ER in worse pain. Later began having constant severe upper stomach pain after I got home. The horrible effects lasted hours. Finally took one of my normal pain meds in the evening, and it alleviated the headache & stomach pain, plus also somehow still worked 1000 times better for my tooth than Toradol. Doctors can do better but they are scared.	1	February 8, 2021	1
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Postoperative Pain	I was prescribed oral keterolac 10 mg for my impacted wisdom tooth removal. I get about an hour of relief, and then the pain is unimaginable. Useless.	1	January 19, 2021	10
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I’ve had toradol in an IV twice in the last year at two different ER’s. May as well have handed me one aleve. So, now I have to sit with this excruciating pain for the foreseeable future. Toradol does not work. At all. But does make doctors very proud of themselves for not prescribing an opiate, which would be the thing that would actually help. I hurt all over. This pain is worse the childbirth but hey, who cares, right?	1	January 5, 2021	13
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I had an IV vitamin infusion about an hour after a root canal. She added Toradol to the IV. For the first day and a half, I had absolutely ZERO pain from the procedure. I could hardly even tell where I had several injections in my mouth. After a day and a half, I started noticing little aches and pains in my mouth from the injections and holding my mouth open for so long. This shows me that the Toradol worked amazingly well until it was all out of my system. I’ll have this done EVERY time I have painful dental work from now on!	10	January 1, 2021	3
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Pain	This drug is a joke ketorolac 10 milligram mg oral tablets. The only way I feel them is if I'm lucky enough to have a narcotic with them because it is an NSAID and does help reduce inflammation that being said it doesn't touch my broken fingers pain. Per Hospital requirement no pain meds unless broken.. I was hoping it would not be broken since it was I was prescribed ketorolac and morphine immediate-release and I feel great this happened Christmas Eve so I'm only 2 Days In. But when I use the ketorolac during the day without the morphine immediate-release there is no effect so I have to tough it out because they only give you a couple days worth of pain meds and you're done and I'm not looking to get hooked anyways so unfortunately ketorolac is what they're giving you for inflammation. I got to go see a hand specialist I have no insurance that makes it very expensive and hard to do especially during a pandemic	3	December 26, 2020	1
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Pain	Have an arthritic thumb. Doc prescribed Ketorolac. Twice a day for 10 days, 10 mg. After three days, I woke up with a loud ringing in my ears. Found out that it’s a side affect. Now have trouble sleeping because my ears are ringing so loud and my thumb is still painful. Wish I never took this nasty drug.	1	December 24, 2020	1
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	When I used Sprix to treat my migraines, I was quite shocked over the severe burning pain it caused in my nose. The burning was far worse than the migraine and I could not keep using this without lidocaine nasal gel or spray.   At the time I bought Sprix, I did not have any drug coverage from my health insurance. Shockingly, a 1 month prescription cost me over $500.00 U.S. dollars!! When I asked to be switched to generic oral Toral (Ketorolac) tablets, the same month's supply and dosage cost me about $20.00 U.S. dollars. Oral ketorolac worked equally effectively to the Sprix nasal spray in terms of analgesia, drug onset time, and duration. I have gastroparesis (stomach paralysis), which can delay oral meds from reaching my intestine, but found that the 20-40 minute onset helped.  My bottom line is to avoid Sprix nasal spray as it is grossly overpriced and it causes such severe burning pain in the nose that Sprix scares away the migraine.	7	November 4, 2020	4
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	As a 5'0, 87lbs woman age 21 who suffers from Endometriosis pains, muscle soreness and runners' knee, I decided the burning bloody nose was worth the trouble. I have yet to see a significant change in mobility but again it's worth it if your insurance covers it. When is the average time to feel the real effects of the drug and is anyone else sneezing it out?	7	October 30, 2020	1
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Postoperative Pain	Post-op major orthopedic surgery, Toradol was great pain management, moderate nausea, mild tinnitus, mild headache and decreased urination. I can function better than when I’ve taken opioids. Sedation is transient about 90 minutes after dose. 10/10	10	October 12, 2020	4
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Toradol IV/IM (ketorolac) for Pain	I had a severe toothache and got Toradol IV/IM in the ER. I honestly didn't think it would work but it did. Thankful for this medicine!!!	10	October 11, 2020	1
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Pain	Prescribed for dental pain that is a 9/10 and this brought it down to a 8/10 for an hour. Honestly the Advil worked better. No relief.	1	October 3, 2020	1
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	"I find Sprix to be helpful for migraine and neck pain. Make sure to read the instructions carefully. Should be sprayed TO THE SIDE of inside the nostril, and not inhaled; breathe through mouth a few minutes, and this reduces the burning. Can use same bottle up to 24 hours; don't put in fridge after using.  Can apply every 6 to 8 hours. My doc didn't say whether to do one or both nostrils, so I tried one the first time and it helped. The second migraine episode, headache was worse, so I  tried both nostrils, and it helped. I'm a woman, age 58, height 5'5"" and weigh 145 lbs."	9	September 25, 2020	8
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Pain	Prescribed ketorolac 10mg by dentist for the time before my tooth could be pulled. Taking it has no effect. Not even the smallest dent in the pain.	1	September 14, 2020	2
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	Toradol was prescribed at an urgent care center.  I’m 70 years old.  The medication relieved pain in my jaw due to a tooth issue.  During the past 5 months I’ve had 3 root canals and a bone graft for the problem.  Toradol worked quickly and allowed me to sleep.  Very helpful!  I received it by injection.	10	August 30, 2020	3
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Pain	I bailed on my skateboard a week or so ago and cracked a couple ribs. The doctor prescribed this to me @10mg 4x daily as needed.  It has done nothing  for the pain. I take it and still feel just as much pain as not taking it.	1	August 30, 2020	2
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	Thank goodness for Toradol! This is what I ask for when I have a chronic migraine. I am writing this now after a trip to urgent care. It does not take the pain away completely but makes it manageable. Just wanted to share because the pain can be agonizing and I hate for anyone to suffer.	10	August 23, 2020	12
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Pain	This drug ketorolac IS HORRIBLE!!! I had surgery last week and they started with an IV then pills when I went home. Nothing helped when I took them, this medicine made me hurt in my stomach worse and I have severe swelling and cramping, sweating, omg I will wake up wet...this medicine is AWFUL...I shouldn't just took 600 mg of Ibuprofen.	1	August 12, 2020	5
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	When you use the nasal spray you have to point the tip to the side of your nose not up still burns for a few seconds but really helped my pain . Reduced it by 50 percent		July 24, 2020	0
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Toradol IV/IM (ketorolac) for Pain	Had a kidney stone last night. In severe pain I went to a local ER. They gave me Toradol IV with absolutely zero pain relief. Later on Morphine did the trick.	1	May 11, 2020	2
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I have a severe case of mono and my tonsils swelled up to the point of not being able to swallow, talk and could barely breathe. was in 9/10 pain and swallowing felt like swallowing knives which is very unbearable. I was given steroids and toradol shot to reduce swelling and for pain. The injection itself was very uncomfortable but within 15 mins I was able to move and open my mouth and it took away my my pain to where I was finally able to swallow solid foods!! I'd say it lasted about 6 hours. It did make me a little drowsy which was nice bc U hadn’t been able to sleep. My arm is still very sore from the injection but was so worth it!!	10	March 16, 2020	5
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I’m a recovering addict (8 years clean) So I can’t risk taking opioids. Thought that I tore ligaments behind my knee, was in constant pain for 3 days before finally I couldn’t take it and went to the VA hospital ER.  Turned out I had a massive blood clot and was immediately given a shot of Toradol in my ass cheek for the pain. About 20 minutes later in the blink of an eye my pain vanished.  Just gone, for about 12 hours.  Something morphine and oxy failed to do after earning 2 Purple Hearts.	10	March 9, 2020	28
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I fractured my L1 vertebrae and got a Toradol injection at the urgent care - the doctor then gave me a three day supply of pills of Toradol 10 mg three times a day - it really did nothing to relieve my pain. I’m going to the orthopedic spine doctor tomorrow and hopefully he can prescribe something that will relieve the pain until the fracture heals	1	March 8, 2020	8
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	Awful nasal pain and caused a horrible headache. Nose burned so bad that my eyes watered and nose wouldn’t stop running. Will never use again. Prefer the toradol injection much more over this! Didn’t even touch my joint pain.	1	February 22, 2020	3
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	No pain relief with Toradol  at all for sciatica back, hip, groin and leg pain. Absolutely NONE,	1	February 21, 2020	20
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Pain	I have frequent and relatively small (5mm) oxalate kidney stones. Despite their small size they produce incredible pain and cramping as they travel down the Ureter. The IV Toradol (ketorolac) that they give me in the ER has never failed to completely eliminate the pain for up to 12 hours. If they could prescribe it in the IV form for home use I would gladly use it until the stone passes.  I've also received Toradol (ketorolac) for an episode of Pleurisy. The results were the same. It completely eliminated the pain.	10	February 14, 2020	3
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	Went to pick up a large garbage bag full of glass bottles. The bag was probably around 50-60 lbs and I carried it with one hand while I maneuvered around my house with it. Walk to my car and up my stairs and boom!! Back gave out. Worst pain I have felt since fracturing my hand. Did the traditional icing, laying down and taking some leftover opioids so that I can walk to bathroom and kitchen. 3 days no change, back still slanted from the hip to the chest so I decided to go to urgent care. They gave me the shot of toradol and my pain when from 10 while standing/walking to a 3. Combined that with muscle relaxer my pain level is 1 right now because of random nerves shooting. I recommend to get this shot. I’m a 27 year old male	10	February 11, 2020	9
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Pain	I got this medication to help with my jaw and shooting teeth nerve pains as my doctor stopped prescribing T3s for the pain. I'd say my teeth pain level were at a 2/10 when on T3s and now using ketorolac pain is a 9/10. Doesn't do anything for severe nerve teeth pain. Plus I've read about people bleeding on the inside cuz of this drug which is sketchy as anything. I'll stick with my t3s thank you very much.	1	January 24, 2020	3
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	This medicine helps me tremendously with my lower back pain. It is given to me through a shot form. Although it makes me sleepy I would say it takes away my pain about 80%. Highly effective for me.	8	January 22, 2020	10
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	Burns my sinuses and gives me a wicked headache. Didn't even full my pain	1	January 19, 2020	2
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I have had 4 Torodal injections over the course of 10 months, the first 3 were for sciatica and the 4th one was for a ligament tear in my knee. The first 3 did wonders for me with no pain at the injection site and almost instant pain relief. However this last time was awful, the injection site burned so bad for around 2 hours, it took 4 hours to work and then I had terrible back pain for the next two days. It's definitely a hit or miss medication.	5	January 19, 2020	7
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	dr gave me a  toradol  shot  before a (medically necessary) 16w3d dilation and evacuation (D&E) to relieve pain during the procedure.  1- it stung for about 30 minutes, about the pain/intensity of a severe chemical burn.  2- it DID NOT provide any pain relief, I had to reschedule and return for a week later so they could figure out a safe way to sedate me with my previous bad reactions to sedatives.  3- the injection site still hurts, over a week after. It’s tender, sore all the time... I can’t lay on my left side (which is how I have slept for 20 years), It feels like there’s a bit of a lump at the site, and it hurts more when I walk because my muscles move. The pain from the D&E is already gone, and it’s only been 1 day with no pain meds whatsoever, not even a Tylenol or ibuprofen. But over a week after the injection and it still hurts excessively.	1	January 16, 2020	7
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I frequently suffer from Kidney Stones that ultimately pass. Christmas Eve I was hit with the worse back pain ever and my urine output was bright red blood. I was at the E.R within 30 minutes. I went through triage and they immediately gave me a shot of Toradol. Within 10 minutes the pain reduced to a very manageable “2.” A CAT-scan confirmed a 17.8 x 12.2 triangular stone that no way would pass. It was stuck at the urethra junction reducing my flow. No Urologist was available so they gave me another shot and sent me home with a prescription for five days. I reached a Urologist the day after Christmas and was immediately scheduled for surgery. Toradol kept me sane and able to focus for the three days. I dislike Opiates and would never accept Fentanyl or Morphine (which have both been offered in the past.)	8	January 3, 2020	8
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	I was prescribed this for post sub muscular ulnar nerve transposition. I was so annoyed I was prescribed this. I didn't get it till a week out and the first time I used it and it did nothing. Nothing more than stinging in my sinuses. I gave it another shot my back was acting up so I decided to try it. I used it as directed and it did nothing but make my nose run profusely. I started noticing an absolute monstrosity  of sinus headache which has me in agony. This is billed as Toradol for post op pain. It didn't even take away mild arthritis pain, or hardware pain. This is the *new* alternative? It sucks, and it is in the trash for me at least. It was NOT worth all I went through to get it.	1	January 1, 2020	3
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I was given Toradol when I had a severe kidney stone attack. It worked immediately, as well as a morphine injection had worked for an earlier kidney stone. I never go out of town without packing my Toradol. Reading these reviews indicates it doesn't work for everyone, but it was a God-send for me.	10	December 30, 2019	4
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Pain	OK. I was given toradol yesterday to use for a rescue medication when I have migraines. Yesterday was a nightmare as it was my first botox treatment and I took one of my toradol and my afternoon meds which I had to postpone for about a hour due to when I had to be at the neurologist. There is no recorded interaction between the two but I'm taking a pain pill and I'm getting worse? I was functional for a few hours this morning and then it showed back up. Repeat pattern and again my migraines were worse when I woke up! I had to break the no other nsaid rule and take 2 Excedrin to go along with it as I am that desperate. Take it with food? If I'm reaching for my rescue meds, 9 times out of 10 food ain't gonna be possible. Am I missing something that they didn't tell me about this medication?	4	December 25, 2019	0
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Postoperative Pain	ketorolac doesn’t do ANYTHING for dental pain. Advil was better, I’m in horrible pain and this drug is like taking nothing at all.	1	December 5, 2019	20
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	Went to urgent care with a migraine for the 3rd day. Got Toradol shot and its been 3 hours with NO relief.		December 2, 2019	7
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Pain	I received a shot into the muscles of my mid back.  Now there is a cord like lump along the injection site and it Is extremely painful.  I’ve had the pain now for 5 days and counting.  I will not get another injection of the medication again.	1	December 1, 2019	1
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	WHY is the pharmacy that dispenses this drug so hard to deal with? Always super long hold times & ignorant people who I can barely understand on the phone.  I don't have the medicine yet because after WEEKS of trying to get through, they told me my insurance needs prior authorization.   So annoyed.		November 20, 2019	1
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I constantly surprise medical staff when I tell them what drug always works.  I start to tell them, wait for the eye roll as they expect me to name some narcotic or opioid.  Nope, Toradol.   Headaches so bad I am literally throwing up, wearing sunglasses into the dr office and walk out smiling and pain free.    Amazing medicine!	10	November 14, 2019	11
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	I was prescribed this medication by my pain management doctor. Unfortunately the doctor didn't tell me how much to use so I called my pharmacist and asked him. He said 1 spray per nostril, which is what I did. No pain relief. I did more research this morning & found that the dosage is weight based. Over 50kg means that I need 2 sprays per nostril. Yes it does burn, but not for very long. I'd read all of the prescribing information that came with the medication so I knew about the nose burn, which will go away after time. I've been dealing with migraine pain, especially after having lidocaine shots over my eyebrows. This knocked down the migraine pain to tolerable. Unfortunately I can't find out how long this drug will stop my pain after I stop using it. I'm guessing that it must last for a while or the dosage would be higher.

Acunivive 15 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	Today I got a toradol shot in my hip for my arthritis and Now the pain is 10 times worse it’s shooting down my leg and when she gave me the shot almost 10 mins later I passed out and my blood pressure dropped super low then the doctor let me drive home....?!	1	November 9, 2019	4
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Postoperative Pain	I just had 4 wisdom teeth removed along with an impacted second molar and was prescribed toradol. I have been amazed to say the least. I was expecting to be in horrible pain. I have about 8 stitches and all I have is sore gums, but that's to be expected. Going on day 2 and haven't had any problems.  I have been prescribed several narcotic pain meds that worked for a short period of time and had to take more. Toradol is a miracle drug and I would definitely recommend it over narcotic pain meds. I haven't had any bad side effects. Idk if people having hallucinations were taking something else with or prior to toradol or just adverse side effects.	10	November 5, 2019	7
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Pain	This drug acted no better than a sugar pill for my sciatica.	1	October 15, 2019	5
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I injured my back this weekend and endured the worst pain I’ve ever felt in my life. My lower back muscles cramped up so bad, I had ribs out, sharp pains, etc.. all at once. I went from fine to being in the floor in tears. The pain even got so bad that it made me sick twice. I finally went to the hospital yesterday because I couldn’t handle it anymore. I was in agony. After doing tests, they gave me a Toradol injection. I went from extremely heavy breathing and not even being able to talk or sit up from the pain being so bad to feeling back to normal in less than 10 minutes. It was like day and night. It was seriously a miracle and such a relief. I’m so grateful I was able to get this injection. I’m still recovering from my injury, but the inflammation went down so much and my chiropractor told me he doesn’t expect it to come back and said the Toradol  really helped. I’m just so happy with this medication that I had to leave a review. I definitely recommend it!	10	October 15, 2019	10
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Postoperative Pain	I was given IV Toradol in hospital. After 2 days of this drug I developed a severe gastric bleed. Do not take this drug.	1	October 14, 2019	11
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Pain	Cuttently taking toradol oral medication 10mg  for lower back pain, it makes me sleepy and physically relaxed but does absolutely nothing to help the actual pain. I can say that the toradol injection almost immediately stopped the pain completely for about 6 hours.	3	September 30, 2019	2
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Postoperative Pain	I was given Toradol following an appendectomy (via my IV) & was impressed with how well it worked. It did make me sleepy, but it also helped my stress-induced migraine! Will have to discuss this option with my neurologist.	9	September 21, 2019	11
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	I was prescribed this for chronic intractable migraine.  I’ve tried triptans, Botox, Aimovig, and nerve blocks.  Sprix will relieve my pain within one hour—I’ve gone  from not working and being laid up, to working 30-hrs per week.  It’s been life-changing.    You do have to follow the directions closely or you will have extreme burning in your nose and throat.  Once you get the hang of it using is much easier.  	9	September 20, 2019	10
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I got an Toradol injection in my hip to help with migraine pain, and I felt so tired all day afterwards. My stomach hurts, and my entire lower back is tensed up and cramping from the injection. I was worried about this, but I saw others posting about it. My migraine is gone but the side effects are uncomfortable. I could have dealt with the migraine pain instead of the side effects from the shot. I was too exhausted to function and get any work done all day.	8	September 18, 2019	2
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	This medication cannot be compared to any opioid or acetaminophen, because neither of those things reduce inflammation. This medication works against swelling and inflammation, which is why it works better for treating stuff like that. It can be used along with an opioid as well, if needed!! Depends on what you're treating. I see a lot of comments saying that this medication works better than opioids, there's a reason for that though!	10	September 14, 2019	7
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	"I suffer from upper back pain that occasionally flares up pretty bad that sends shooting pain into my left shoulder blade and this time up into my head. I had pain in the back on my head for about 3 weeks, then it moved to my left temple where it throbbed so bad, I finally went to the ER, they gave a muscle injection of Torodal and a Norflex (muscle relaxer) injection. The pain went from a 9 to a 1 within 15 minutes. Wish I would've went in sooner. I'm glad I figured out that this drug is an option. Normally ibuprofen works for me but sometimes it doesn't at all, the nurse said this is a ""souped up version"" of ibuprofen."	10	September 13, 2019	5
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	They gave me this Toradol shot and man this shot hurt me. I couldn't move my arm for an hour!!! And really didn't feel a significant relief I swear the shot was not worth my time !!!	1	September 12, 2019	15
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	The ER Dr gave me Toradol for L1 fracture pain. I hadn't slept in 48 hrs. It was useless.	1	September 9, 2019	11
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Pain	I have received this medication twice in my life now and both times it worked great to help relieve the pain from kidney stones. The anti inflammatory effects help a lot too to make the stone pass easier and a little faster. They gave me that and Dilaudid together. The pain was worse the second time I had my kidney stones, so it didn’t completely go away, but I went from like an 8 or 9 down to about a 3.	8	September 9, 2019	2
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	I suffer from severe chronic migraines that come with a variety of symptoms outside of pain. They're new to me, and so far I've found that I only have a very small window to take an oral abortive medication before they become ineffective and I'm left to wait out the migraine which becomes hard being a music student and always surrounded by sound and light. Being in college, I can't always get to my neurologist's office for injections either, which is when I was prescribed Sprix. After a week-long migraine, Sprix managed to cut my pain from a 7-8 range down to a 2-3 in only about ten minutes. It's difficult to administer at first, you have to angle the bottle right and hold your breath and make sure not to inhale it after for the next few minutes, but the discomfort is will worth the pain relief and so far minimal side effects. The second dose was easier than the first, and so far has helped just as much, and so far my other symptoms have been relieved along with the pain!	10	September 7, 2019	12
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	It burns so bad your nose. I can’t not take	2	August 28, 2019	1
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	On 8/11/19 I was in a car accident. I was diagnosed with, Cervical Spine Sprain and Strain. Thoracic Spine Sprain, as well as a left hip strain. I’ve been to the ER twice. Along with the dr through my work as this accident happened while I was working. My second time in the ER was last night. They gave me IV Toradol, along with IV Valum. (I’m a cancer survivor so I’m also on Dilaudid and Gabapentin at home. I couldn’t get my pain under control with these medications.) I waited for my MRI and was in pain awful. Once this medication kicked in I was shocked at how well it worked!!! MRI  revealed that everything else is okay. However the dr said my muscles and tendons etc were so tight!!! This medication helped so much that it’s now the next day and thankful my muscle spams have not come back! I’d ask for this medication anyway before pain meds for my back pain!	10	August 23, 2019	9
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I have chronic pain every day with back problems and suffer migraines as well. I'm in pain management I do take opioids for my pain, but this morning terrible migraine 2 days in a row Dr got me in and gave me injection of toradol and instantly migraine gone and also helped with my back pain today. So from someone that takes pain meds and getting this injection I say wow Toradol does work!!!!!!!!	8	August 20, 2019	9
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	I have severe endometriosis pain and didn’t want to be on birth control. I also tried Orillisa and with that I traded one pain for another with extreme migraines. I had basically given up at that point until my doc told me to try Sprix. I was still skeptical but I said what do I have to loose so on my second day of extreme endo pain I tried it and when I tell u my pain was 95% gone ! I couldn’t believe it I'm still in shock this medication is something I cannot live without now I'm so happy	8	August 19, 2019	7
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Toradol IV/IM (ketorolac) for Pain	I just had an IV  with Toradol along with Magnesium at an   infusion center  for very nasty/chronic migraine & posterior cervical pain. As in the  past, I did not get NOT get very much relief. I got off OXYCod. 7.5 mg. because of my tolerance that one gets after longterm use. In pain almost every day ! Had cervical 4-level fusion  on Jan 28. Wish I never did ! Imitrex only helps migraine not the cervical/occipital pain daily. Anyone know how I can get pain relief! Tried many 'scripts over last 10+ yrs.  	3	August 12, 2019	0
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	I started using it for my sciatica pain and it helps tremendously!!  If it’s burning your nose off , reread the directions and try again. I’m grateful to have it.	8	August 12, 2019	8
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I have been given this medication countless times and I'm yet to have it EVER work.	1	August 7, 2019	15
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Postoperative Pain	Prescribed Ketorolac for pain and infection after having all teeth removed. Took forever to start working and when it did I still had a lot of pain.	4	August 1, 2019	7
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Toradol IV/IM (ketorolac) for Pain	I have severe migraines. Despite neurology shots in my head, neck and shoulders I still get migraines. I usually have sumatriptan pills to help at the start of one. But when caffeine and these don’t work, I take a ketoralac/tramadol shot IM at home. These help avoid ER visits and hospitalization. It takes about 15 minutes for it to really kick in, but the effect is almost immediate...as if the migraine never happened. When I did go to the ER, tramadol IV instantly removed any pain in my eyes, head and neck. I’ve had no side effects other than about 30 minutes of tenderness where I received the shot (upper arm).   This works for some and not others. Mine is only as needed for severe pain.	9	July 31, 2019	2
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I went to a carnival with my family and hurt my back on one of the rides. I found out later they weren't even supposed to let people on that part of the ride due to the possibility of injury. So I went to an urgent care clinic as soon as they were open cause my pain hadn't got any better. They gave me Toradol it hurt at the injection site and made my back pain about 2x worse than it already  was.  It took over an hour to kick in and only gave me relief for about 15 min I then had to wait 2 hrs at a hospital with orders for xrays in severe pain all because I live an hour away from the hospital. My husband called and complained about it and we found out that because we went in with orders we should have been seen right away. I'm stuck with a useless hospital system that taking over every clinic and service possible in my area.. And since we live in an area with a lot of addicts and pill seekers its impossible to get help when its really needed	1	July 23, 2019	19
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	I suffer from severe chronic daily (every single day!) migraines as well as Trigeminal Neuralgia types 1 & 2. Trigeminal Neuralgia is considered to be the worst possible pain a human can experience, is nicknamed “the suicide disease”, and is extremely difficult to manage. I am beyond grateful for this medication! It helps manage both conditions incredibly well. Someone here complained that it was like pouring acid up your nose and down your throat. They aren’t using it properly. It takes a while to get the hang of it (you have to to you head forward and DO NOT inhale!). The only negative is it can only be used sparingly, as an “emergency” medication for your worst days, because the most you can get is 5 vials per month. But I would be in an awful place without this. It makes me stop screaming out (truly) in Trigeminal pain. I dulls my worst migraines. You just learn to choose your battles. It is strong, effective medication for severe and exquisite pain. I highly recommend it.	10	July 23, 2019	18
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Postoperative Pain	This medication doesn't work for my pain, I don't want or need narcotics just want something to relieve my pain so I can slep	1	June 12, 2019	15
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I have shingles, these things always crop up on a weekend, when your primary care physician isn't available. Went to an urgent care clinic and this is what they gave me for pain.  Seems to be working.  I think I can get some sleep anyway.	7	June 2, 2019	6
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Pain	I had severe back pain for over a year and this took it away completely when I got it. It has been a miracle for me. I would like to know if anyone takes this regularly? Twice a day? Is it dangerous to do this as this is what I’ve done for over a month and have had no side effects.	10	May 25, 2019	1
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	I don't know how it works for pain,  haven't given it enough time to tell.  But you may as well spray acid into your nose/sinuses/throat.... won't use twice.	5	May 15, 2019	5
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I was given IV Toradol for severe pain while in the ER after a bad neck injury .  The injection hurt my vein so bad I thought I was going to pass out.  Took all of my neck pain away for about 30 seconds, then I was back up to an 8.  I was really hoping it would work.	2	May 12, 2019	12
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	I was given this by my neurologist for migraines. I’m also an epileptic so  taking any new meds can cause my seizures to be worse. So it’s been sitting in my fridge for 3 weeks. 4 days ago I had a really bad seizure and with it came the horrible migraine. I took my first dose of Sprix and I felt like I had just spayed pepper spray up my nose! Omg!! It was like an instant panic attack from pain! Once the pain in my nose was gone (about 15 min) I noticed my migraine was almost completely gone. I had to talk myself into taking my second dose. But once I made it past the burn my migraine was completely gone, so yes the Sprix works great on migraines, it was amazing!! My issue is how healthy is this if it comes with that much pain.....?	7	May 10, 2019	11
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I was in the hospital for meningitis and all they would give me for pain was  this rubbish Toradol and Tylenol ! Really? I didn't receive any noticeable benefit from this medication and thanks to the opioid crisis this is all they would give me! I wouldn't give this stuff to my dog.	2	May 9, 2019	10
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	Toradol didn’t relieve any pain	1	May 7, 2019	15
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	This medicine is the worst thing they have invented for pain , it doesn't work and it burns really bad your nose and it doesn't take the pain away		May 3, 2019	2
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	So my first dose was a quite uncomfortable burning sensation. Second dose was less burning 3rd and 4th dose for the day barely any burning at all. This has taken my pain from an 8-10 down to a 1-2 on the pain scale. I've used this medicine to treat my chronic low back pain myofascial pain syndrome chronic sciatica. The doctor has given me this to get me through until I can get to pain management. I'm already seeing fantastic results I might just continue what this medication.	10	May 2, 2019	14
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	I hate taking this. I mean hate taking it. It burns your nose, it usually makes me feel sick for a couple of days. But it helps so much with pain, even instantly. I would rather deal with a burning nose and sore throat than my fibromyalgia pain so I am grateful for this medication.	10	April 16, 2019	14
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	Was given a toradol shot for sciatica yesterday…totally useless. Still in pain.	1	April 4, 2019	18
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Pain	I received Toradol intravenously in the ER for kidney stone pain. It gave me relief within minutes of them putting in the IV. The pain went from a 10/10 down to about a 3.	8	March 21, 2019	1
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Toradol IV/IM (ketorolac) for Pain	Toradol makes me feel pretty strange and out of it for a few days. It works for post-procedure pain, but I honestly don't know if it's any more effective than just taking ibuprofen. Regardless, I'd rather deal with a headache after my procedure than feel weird and in pain for a few days.	5	March 16, 2019	1
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I pulled the stent from my ureter after having a stone removed and within minutes I was in severe pain. After 2 hours of worsening pain I drove to the urologists office and begged to help relieve the enormous treachery I was enduring. They gave me a shot to my hip and within minutes the pain level dropped from 9 to a 5. The relief was a Godsend. The anti-inflammatory in the drug opened the ureter and allowed blood clots and other debris to filter into the bladder. I was then prescribed toradol in pill form. This got me through the horrific ordeal I had experienced. 	10	February 16, 2019	12
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	I was skeptical and apprehensive about using this medicine after my hip replacement surgery, so for the first 13 days I avoided it. I take piroxicam for my cervical spondylosis and as the days went on the pain in my neck became unbearable, yet my hip pain was minimal. I wasn't able to take the piroxicam with the aspirin I was taking as a blood thinner. This resulted in extreme neck pain and migraine headaches that were debilitating.  I gave in and took the Sprix for the first time when on day 14 I just couldn't function. The pain in my neck and head was intolerable so I had to do something. I took it and within 20 minutes or less the pain had moderated to a level I could stand. Within an hour it was almost completely gone.  I am now a believer. Glad I tried it!	10	February 11, 2019	17
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	This medicine has helped me tremendously with migraines and fibromyalgia. I am unable to take Maxalt or similar drugs due to a reaction so this has been an absolute lifesaver for me!	10	February 4, 2019	9
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I was given a toradol shot for severe sciatica pain.  Might as well have given me an injection of water--NO pain relief whatsoever.	1	February 4, 2019	20
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Toradol IV/IM (ketorolac) for Pain	I had my first kidney stone (I didn't know a human could feel such pain, writhing on the floor, etc.). I got an IV dose of Toradol in the ambulance, and a Toradol pill in the ER. Neither had any effect on the pain. About two hours later, the stone passed on its own, and the pain vanished.	1	January 28, 2019	1
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Toradol IV/IM (ketorolac) for Pain	"Let me see. Toradol? It's a joke. 56 surgeries, body parts that are not mine, shot, stabbed and blown up. 30 years USMC, oh, and I am now told I have CRPS. McGill Pain Scale  is a 1, a ONE for CRPS. Due to all of the surgeries from trauma I have received far too much morphine. Can't tolerate any med but IM demerol for pain. Why this rubbish is even on the market amazes me. Perhaps it is to make the morons we, well some of us, call ""doctor"" feel even more important. Toradol is a waste of $$$ and time."	1	January 24, 2019	0
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Postoperative Pain	I had knee replacement surgery and was given a Hydrocodone combination along with a Ketorolac prescription after leaving the hospital. It worked better on my pain than the opioids prescribed. I did not have any side effects. Wonderful drug.	10	January 11, 2019	2
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	I have to agree with a few others I also wish this could be used for more days than five.  I have fibromyalgia and polio, sprix works great for me I have not experienced burning in my nose or throat as of yet.  I do hope they read the reviews so they can see this medication has helped a lot of us! For me I'm glad I gave this a try 	10	January 9, 2019	12
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I suffer from Chronic kidney stones.  The first time I was given Tordol interveniously and it literally worked within a minute!! I was in so much pain and vomiting from the pain. After the Tordol it relieved the kidney pain immediately.  Now when I’m rushed to hospital or walk in clinic, it’s the first thing I ask for! I’ve never had it as a shot in my muscle, so I can’t give my opinion, but through an IV was awesome. I have had no side effects from it either!		January 7, 2019	8
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Toradol IM (ketorolac) for Pain	I had fallen the day before and ended up the next day with back spasms. These aren't just little twinges, they are like someone is sticking a knife in my back. They are the worst!! I sent in to the doctor's office and they gave me a shot of Toradol. I got absolutely no relief at all. Might as well have been a placebo. I didn't have any side effects from it, which is unusual for me.  My spasms lasted for 12 hours straight before stopping.	1	January 3, 2019	2
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	I have not found that Sprix is very helpful for me. I felt no change in my pain relief. The burning that some have mentioned was not that bad to me. Don't sniff it in. That's not how you are supposed to take it. Make sure to watch the video and it shows exactly how to do it!	3	December 18, 2018	6
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	I'm 38 and have had occasional headaches most of my life.  This is the 1st drug that has been this effective.	10	December 11, 2018	6
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I have chronic kidney stones and they always want to give me toradol IM for the pain. First off, the standards for what constitutes a properly sized muscle need to be reviewed, because 1/3 of the time, they'll give it to me in the deltoid, while the rest of the time, they insist on the gluteus medius. Regardless of where they put it, it doesn't help much with the problem at hand. If I happen to have a headache or sore back at the time, the toradol clears it right up. The severe pain it's meant to treat, on the other hand, barely has the edge taken off. The worst thing is that it causes intense soreness and cramping in the injection site for hours, far worse than a tetanus shot. Some people have good experiences, so it's worth a try to dodge opioids, but don't be afraid to tell them it doesn't work.	3	November 29, 2018	8
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I have MS and pinched nerve in my C spine . When I have a flare up or bad spasticity this drug works great ! Go in , get a shot and literally 1 minute later the pain is relieved .	10	November 29, 2018	3
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	I’ve suffered with migraines for over 10 years. I’ve taken everything and done all kinds of treatment. Including Botox. This nasal spray works within 10 mins. It does burn your nose pretty bad and leaves a horrible taste in your throat. But ..... it’s amazing. My only complaint is once you’ve opened a small bottle you have to dispose in 24hrs. I’ve tried to keep them longer and the medicine just doesn’t work after that time period. I would highly recommend this to anyone with chronic migraines. It had been a life saver	10	November 28, 2018	10
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	They gave me this drug for a pulled muscle in my back, it helped with the pain, but the side effects were not worth it, terrible stomach pain, burning in my stomach, belching, bloating, 3 days since the injection, and my stomach is still not back to normal, I will never take this drug again	1	November 9, 2018	8
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Toradol IM (ketorolac) for Pain	Went to my Primary Care with extreme, crippling menstrual pain (I have cysts and endometriosis). Nurse injected in my arm, I am routinely used to injections and I've never felt such pain from a needle in my life.  My entire arm went numb, I couldn't feel my hand. Then, for a long while afterwards I kept getting shockwaves up and down my arm, like bees stinging inside of my nerves. Not sure if this was the drug or malpractice? Minutes later I was vomiting profusely in the office wastebasket. My arm then developed a large, red circular rash. Apparently this is not a normal reaction. Once I was home, I also got a hideous migraine as a side effect. The drug did relieve my cramps, and knocked me out for a good several hours, but it wasn't worth the headache or the pain in my arm. Never again.	1	October 25, 2018	1
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I had a heart attack in March 2018. In the hospital, they were giving me Morphine for pain. I hated the way it made me feel and it did nothing for the pain. After a day of Morphine I asked that I be given something else, thus my introduction to Toradol. I wish I'd known about Toradol before being given Morphine. It made me feel so much better, without the horrible side effects of Morphine.	10	October 24, 2018	9
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Postoperative Pain	This was given to me after multiple surgeries stemming from a botched gallbladder removal. This drug gave me horrible hallucinations and extremely vivid dreams. It scared me to death out and made me sweat profusely. I don’t ever want anything to do with this drug again.	1	October 3, 2018	6
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Toradol IM (ketorolac) for Pain	Received IM injection. No relief of pain. Caused pain, paresthesia, hyperesthesia and numbness from hip injection site to lateral knee. This persists 6 weeks later. Experienced nausea and violent vomiting for 12 hours as well. I will not take this again	1	September 28, 2018	2
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I get a toradol shot when I get a migraine that lasts longer than a day and when naproxen hasn't help. I have had them help and sometimes they do not.   Got one today and the pain was gone within an hour. Plus the nurse did a great job, no burning sensation after injection. I have been lucky lately, not having a bad burning sensation. I once had a nurse inject it quickly and had the worst burning sensation from it. I think when it is injected slower it's better.   Overall the toradol shot is good for me. I also take hydroxyzine (anti anxiety, antihistamine) at onset of migraine too.  The NASID and antihistamine work very well for me.	9	September 28, 2018	9
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	They always try to give me this when I have a migraine. It has never worked for my pain. They still make me try it before they will even consider giving me anything else. It is no better than 800mg of Advil or Cambia. And I can take that stuff at home without having to pay a copay! So frustrating that this is the first line of defence for a migraine that won’t go away.	2	September 18, 2018	8
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Toradol IV/IM (ketorolac) for Pain	I suffer from severe nerve and back pain. When my gabapentin and norcos can't cut it I go to the ER and get a shot of toradol. I will have electric shooting pains that go down my leg and out my foot every few minutes. 60 mg of Toradol will have me pain-free within an hour. I have gone several times so far. One flare-up was so bad that the shot only stopped it for 24 hrs and I had to go back the next day and get another. Then I was good for a few months till the next bad flare up	10	September 6, 2018	4
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	Toradol right into my sciatic nerve worked for 18 months. Tonight they want to put toradol in my shoulder.  Seems dumb to put toradol into my bloodstream and not where the pain is.		September 6, 2018	4
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	Used this post hip labrum and FAI arthroscopic surgery. Works incredibly well. Never needed to supplement the narcotic pain pills they prescribed. Took Sprix with Tylenol and with ice every hour I was virtually pain free.	10	September 2, 2018	6
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	I had a Superior Hypogastric Plexus Block aka a giant needle guided by x-ray though muscles and spine to numb some nerves for my chronic endometriosis pain. I was given SPRIX to help in my recovery from the injection and it did nothing but make me nauseous. If it helped with the pain I couldn't tell. I think Percocet would do better than this NSAID-SPRIX.  Note: I've got a tolerance for strong meds so it takes a lot of anything to help me when I have severe pain. I think it might help others but isn't strong enough for me.  My dosage was 15.75mg spray in each nose every 6-8 hours. The burn hurts bad, makes me cry and sometimes makes me sneeze. After 1 day of usage with no relief I'm calling my Dr for something else.  FYI: On the other hand this block I get does help my endometriosis pain after the recovery from the injection itself. If you happen to have chronic endo. pain I can recommend this shot.	1	September 1, 2018	3
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	I’ve had Kidney stones for 25 years. I’m now 42. Having a stone 2-5 times a year really sucks. Only a couple years ago my doctor RX’d me Sprix. Yes, it kind of burns the nose a little and drips down your throat and taste horrible . Chase it with some water. It absolutely takes to pain away in a matter of 5-15 minutes tops. So much better than Dilaudid 4mg. Wish I had this years ago. So much easier than having narcotics.	10	August 28, 2018	7
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I got a injection of Toradol when I was admitted the night before I gotten my gallbladder out. I was in so much pain and Dilaudid only helped me for a hour at the most. My nurse finally gave me a shot of Toradol and I could finally sleep. Having a gallstones attack was the worst pain I have ever felt in my life. It lasted until I woke up after surgery and was in my room. I am so grateful that it helped!	10	August 25, 2018	4
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Toradol IM (ketorolac) for Pain	I was in #9+ pain after a cervical (SPINE) nerve cauterizing procedure, (in addition to migraine) & was highly distressed  to get ZERO pain relief.  The drive/additional nausea/pain/stress to get the Toradol shot caused WORSE pain than if I'd known Toradol was the only remedy offered. Toradol is not effective for me at all!	1	August 23, 2018	2
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	I absolutely wish there was a formulation I could take for more than 5 days. If I could take this every day, I could probably go off of my narcotic pain meds. I will agree with many, the taste and burning can be hard but it’s definitely worth it. At least for me.	10	August 19, 2018	8
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	"As most have stated this burns terribly, however I DO NOT CARE! I would take worse pain if its something that will elevate my migraines. I am on a whole host of meds, and I hate medication. I prefer natural means, however nothing worked so here I am. I will do anything to rid myself of these migraines. I have had nerve blocks and a few times gone to the ER for a ""migraine cocktail"" this medication has replaced that need. When living with a violent migraine for 21 days, I would try anything! Having this on hand eliminates that possibility. This DOES WORK! Just push through the initial nose burn and move on. As stated I do not like medication, I have resigned myself to that not being the case, but I do push my limits. I only use this as a last resort and only after a few days of trying everything else.  I hope my rant encourages you to stick through the nose pain. If you do....a clear and quiet mind with NO PAIN, PUKING, LOSS OF VISION, it legit gives you your life back with in a few mins."	8	August 15, 2018	9
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I got a shot of toradol after I went to ER for nerve pain. As soon as she stabbed it in my arm I felt pain. My hand is cramping and have tingling all over my body.	1	August 4, 2018	5
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I had daily headaches resulting from a concussion. A neurologist put me on Toradol and I could not wait to wean myself off. I had such stabbing pain in both eyes from it I could barely function. I now take Elavil and am very excited not to have headaches! Fingers crossed!		July 26, 2018	6
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	Toradol worked right away on back pain.  The shot hurt a bit,  but now, the next morning, I can't go to work as I have got  diarrhea, chills and fever, heartburn. Just like the side effect list.	9	July 25, 2018	4
Acunivive 15 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	Sprix burns my nose HORRIBLY! Even if I don’t inhale it later after I sniff just a little it burns every sinus cavity and makes my eyes water and burn. Then when I finally lay back down it burns my throat for about 30 minutes. It feels like I’m shoving jalapeños up my nose and in my sinus cavities. As for the pain it doesn’t help there either. Maybe this medicine is just not for me.	1	July 8, 2018	1
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	Went into the ER on Friday April 23 for chest and left arm pain, was given a Toradol injection in my left arm, burned like anything, kind of like 3 bees stung me. It eased the pain for a little, from about a 10 to a 7 in pain level , it is now Sunday and I still feel the stinging sensation in my arm and the pain has gone down all the way to my left rib cage,  now, my chest is just fine, but now I have this damn pain from the injection. I have been placing a cold ice pack and it helps a little , at night pain gets worse where I had the injection.  I honestly don't recommend Toradol it hurts like anything.	1	April 26, 2021	0
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	Woke up with severe stomach, flank, and left sided back pain. About 5 days of horrific pain scheduled doctor's visit. He then sent me to the ER. Was kept in the ER for over 8 hours. Given IV meds that got rid of pain for a short period of time, but made me itch horribly. Went back to my PCP and was told I had diverticulitis and possibly triggered my degenerate disc disease  Given antibiotics and an injection of toradol.  Heavens above my pain is gone. Prescription toradol every 6 hours PRN. I am so grateful. This has got to be a wonder drug. Hope I can heal and pain stays at bay	10	April 25, 2021	0
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I went into the ER because of a seven day long migraine. They gave me a shot of Toradol. Within one hour my entire abdomen was painfully heaving and cramping about every 1 to 2 minutes. For the first five days I couldn’t eat, and I couldn’t sit down, because sitting made it worse. So I paced my house until I was so exhausted that I could nap. Then I would wake up in the middle of the night and continue to pace until I was so exhausted I could go back to sleep again.   That severe heaving and cramping continued for five straight weeks. It took three different medication‘s to get it to stop.  It was the most torturous time of my entire life. I could barely sleep, and I couldn’t work.  Now, I can’t even take Advil. It causes the same response. (Before the Toradol I took Advil all the time with positive results.)	1	April 21, 2021	0
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Toradol IM (ketorolac) for Pain	I have arachnoiditis, which is inflammation of the arachnoid layer of the covering of the spinal cord. I have 24/7 intractable pain for which I am on injectable dilaudid. When my pain flares even the dilaudid doesn’t work. Enter Toredol which saves my life. I inject 30 mg at home every other day when I’m flaring. Can’t take more than that because it is bad for your GI tract if you take too long. It is a God send.	10	March 24, 2021	0
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	Went to the ER for awful lower abdominal pain. Was given Toradol intravenously and my pain did not go away. I felt no different in terms of pain. I did get a little sleep but that is it. ☹️	1	March 14, 2021	0
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	If you have Eosinophilic esophagitis (EOE)....DO NOT TAKE OR ACCEPT THIS DRUG!!!! I went into the ER for arm & chest pain. (No heart attack...I believe it was my EOE causing spasming) The dr didn’t bat an eye when I told him I have EOE. I got the injection form & right off the bat started having issues with it. It also did diddly squat for the pain that I went in for.  I told the dr I wasn’t feeling right (sick to my stomach & dizzy at the time). He took my oxygen level & then gave me my discharge papers. That night, stomach pain. The next day, stomach pain & my body felt super fidgety on the inside. The next day, back in the ER because my stomach pain was getting worse along with my tremors. 5 days later, I’m still having tremors. My stomach is still hurting.  Going off the side effect list, I’ve had quite a few of the reactions listed. This is definitely a no go for me ever again!!!!! I went in the ER for one issue & came out with another.	1	March 12, 2021	0
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Pain	This medicine is so amazing the way it blocks the pain receptors. Incredible job creating this! This medication is a God send!	10	February 21, 2021	0
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	Went to Urgent Care for back pain. The Toradol did not work. The pain did not lessen at all. What a waste of money	1	February 18, 2021	2
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	OMG this is THE BEST pain reliever I’ve had. It even worked better than the IV fentanyl that was ordered following a shoulder surgery. If I could take it every day, I would, but it’s dangerous, and the restrictions are for patient safety. But if it’s an option for pain relief, I’ll take it over a narcotic any day.	10	February 15, 2021	6
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I have Ehlers Danlos Syndrome (EDS) but currently have an infected tooth. (Tooth pain is the worst pain possible imo) Pain so bad, beats per minute was 168. Went to ER, Dr rx Toradol. Never had it as am allergic to NSAIDS. (not even sure if its ok for me?) A few minutes after it was administrated via IV, I started having a severe headache along with pain down my neck. It did absolutely nothing to lower the excruciating tooth pain either. I'm on long term pain meds for my EDS (10+ years) I assumed my meds weren't working due to the bad infection. Was sent home from ER in worse pain. Later began having constant severe upper stomach pain after I got home. The horrible effects lasted hours. Finally took one of my normal pain meds in the evening, and it alleviated the headache & stomach pain, plus also somehow still worked 1000 times better for my tooth than Toradol. Doctors can do better but they are scared.	1	February 8, 2021	1
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Postoperative Pain	I was prescribed oral keterolac 10 mg for my impacted wisdom tooth removal. I get about an hour of relief, and then the pain is unimaginable. Useless.	1	January 19, 2021	10
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I’ve had toradol in an IV twice in the last year at two different ER’s. May as well have handed me one aleve. So, now I have to sit with this excruciating pain for the foreseeable future. Toradol does not work. At all. But does make doctors very proud of themselves for not prescribing an opiate, which would be the thing that would actually help. I hurt all over. This pain is worse the childbirth but hey, who cares, right?	1	January 5, 2021	13
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I had an IV vitamin infusion about an hour after a root canal. She added Toradol to the IV. For the first day and a half, I had absolutely ZERO pain from the procedure. I could hardly even tell where I had several injections in my mouth. After a day and a half, I started noticing little aches and pains in my mouth from the injections and holding my mouth open for so long. This shows me that the Toradol worked amazingly well until it was all out of my system. I’ll have this done EVERY time I have painful dental work from now on!	10	January 1, 2021	3
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Pain	This drug is a joke ketorolac 10 milligram mg oral tablets. The only way I feel them is if I'm lucky enough to have a narcotic with them because it is an NSAID and does help reduce inflammation that being said it doesn't touch my broken fingers pain. Per Hospital requirement no pain meds unless broken.. I was hoping it would not be broken since it was I was prescribed ketorolac and morphine immediate-release and I feel great this happened Christmas Eve so I'm only 2 Days In. But when I use the ketorolac during the day without the morphine immediate-release there is no effect so I have to tough it out because they only give you a couple days worth of pain meds and you're done and I'm not looking to get hooked anyways so unfortunately ketorolac is what they're giving you for inflammation. I got to go see a hand specialist I have no insurance that makes it very expensive and hard to do especially during a pandemic	3	December 26, 2020	1
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Pain	Have an arthritic thumb. Doc prescribed Ketorolac. Twice a day for 10 days, 10 mg. After three days, I woke up with a loud ringing in my ears. Found out that it’s a side affect. Now have trouble sleeping because my ears are ringing so loud and my thumb is still painful. Wish I never took this nasty drug.	1	December 24, 2020	1
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	When I used Sprix to treat my migraines, I was quite shocked over the severe burning pain it caused in my nose. The burning was far worse than the migraine and I could not keep using this without lidocaine nasal gel or spray.   At the time I bought Sprix, I did not have any drug coverage from my health insurance. Shockingly, a 1 month prescription cost me over $500.00 U.S. dollars!! When I asked to be switched to generic oral Toral (Ketorolac) tablets, the same month's supply and dosage cost me about $20.00 U.S. dollars. Oral ketorolac worked equally effectively to the Sprix nasal spray in terms of analgesia, drug onset time, and duration. I have gastroparesis (stomach paralysis), which can delay oral meds from reaching my intestine, but found that the 20-40 minute onset helped.  My bottom line is to avoid Sprix nasal spray as it is grossly overpriced and it causes such severe burning pain in the nose that Sprix scares away the migraine.	7	November 4, 2020	4
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	As a 5'0, 87lbs woman age 21 who suffers from Endometriosis pains, muscle soreness and runners' knee, I decided the burning bloody nose was worth the trouble. I have yet to see a significant change in mobility but again it's worth it if your insurance covers it. When is the average time to feel the real effects of the drug and is anyone else sneezing it out?	7	October 30, 2020	1
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Postoperative Pain	Post-op major orthopedic surgery, Toradol was great pain management, moderate nausea, mild tinnitus, mild headache and decreased urination. I can function better than when I’ve taken opioids. Sedation is transient about 90 minutes after dose. 10/10	10	October 12, 2020	4
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Toradol IV/IM (ketorolac) for Pain	I had a severe toothache and got Toradol IV/IM in the ER. I honestly didn't think it would work but it did. Thankful for this medicine!!!	10	October 11, 2020	1
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Pain	Prescribed for dental pain that is a 9/10 and this brought it down to a 8/10 for an hour. Honestly the Advil worked better. No relief.	1	October 3, 2020	1
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	"I find Sprix to be helpful for migraine and neck pain. Make sure to read the instructions carefully. Should be sprayed TO THE SIDE of inside the nostril, and not inhaled; breathe through mouth a few minutes, and this reduces the burning. Can use same bottle up to 24 hours; don't put in fridge after using.  Can apply every 6 to 8 hours. My doc didn't say whether to do one or both nostrils, so I tried one the first time and it helped. The second migraine episode, headache was worse, so I  tried both nostrils, and it helped. I'm a woman, age 58, height 5'5"" and weigh 145 lbs."	9	September 25, 2020	8
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Pain	Prescribed ketorolac 10mg by dentist for the time before my tooth could be pulled. Taking it has no effect. Not even the smallest dent in the pain.	1	September 14, 2020	2
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	Toradol was prescribed at an urgent care center.  I’m 70 years old.  The medication relieved pain in my jaw due to a tooth issue.  During the past 5 months I’ve had 3 root canals and a bone graft for the problem.  Toradol worked quickly and allowed me to sleep.  Very helpful!  I received it by injection.	10	August 30, 2020	3
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Pain	I bailed on my skateboard a week or so ago and cracked a couple ribs. The doctor prescribed this to me @10mg 4x daily as needed.  It has done nothing  for the pain. I take it and still feel just as much pain as not taking it.	1	August 30, 2020	2
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	Thank goodness for Toradol! This is what I ask for when I have a chronic migraine. I am writing this now after a trip to urgent care. It does not take the pain away completely but makes it manageable. Just wanted to share because the pain can be agonizing and I hate for anyone to suffer.	10	August 23, 2020	12
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Pain	This drug ketorolac IS HORRIBLE!!! I had surgery last week and they started with an IV then pills when I went home. Nothing helped when I took them, this medicine made me hurt in my stomach worse and I have severe swelling and cramping, sweating, omg I will wake up wet...this medicine is AWFUL...I shouldn't just took 600 mg of Ibuprofen.	1	August 12, 2020	5
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	When you use the nasal spray you have to point the tip to the side of your nose not up still burns for a few seconds but really helped my pain . Reduced it by 50 percent		July 24, 2020	0
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Toradol IV/IM (ketorolac) for Pain	Had a kidney stone last night. In severe pain I went to a local ER. They gave me Toradol IV with absolutely zero pain relief. Later on Morphine did the trick.	1	May 11, 2020	2
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I have a severe case of mono and my tonsils swelled up to the point of not being able to swallow, talk and could barely breathe. was in 9/10 pain and swallowing felt like swallowing knives which is very unbearable. I was given steroids and toradol shot to reduce swelling and for pain. The injection itself was very uncomfortable but within 15 mins I was able to move and open my mouth and it took away my my pain to where I was finally able to swallow solid foods!! I'd say it lasted about 6 hours. It did make me a little drowsy which was nice bc U hadn’t been able to sleep. My arm is still very sore from the injection but was so worth it!!	10	March 16, 2020	5
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I’m a recovering addict (8 years clean) So I can’t risk taking opioids. Thought that I tore ligaments behind my knee, was in constant pain for 3 days before finally I couldn’t take it and went to the VA hospital ER.  Turned out I had a massive blood clot and was immediately given a shot of Toradol in my ass cheek for the pain. About 20 minutes later in the blink of an eye my pain vanished.  Just gone, for about 12 hours.  Something morphine and oxy failed to do after earning 2 Purple Hearts.	10	March 9, 2020	28
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I fractured my L1 vertebrae and got a Toradol injection at the urgent care - the doctor then gave me a three day supply of pills of Toradol 10 mg three times a day - it really did nothing to relieve my pain. I’m going to the orthopedic spine doctor tomorrow and hopefully he can prescribe something that will relieve the pain until the fracture heals	1	March 8, 2020	8
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	Awful nasal pain and caused a horrible headache. Nose burned so bad that my eyes watered and nose wouldn’t stop running. Will never use again. Prefer the toradol injection much more over this! Didn’t even touch my joint pain.	1	February 22, 2020	3
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	No pain relief with Toradol  at all for sciatica back, hip, groin and leg pain. Absolutely NONE,	1	February 21, 2020	20
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Pain	I have frequent and relatively small (5mm) oxalate kidney stones. Despite their small size they produce incredible pain and cramping as they travel down the Ureter. The IV Toradol (ketorolac) that they give me in the ER has never failed to completely eliminate the pain for up to 12 hours. If they could prescribe it in the IV form for home use I would gladly use it until the stone passes.  I've also received Toradol (ketorolac) for an episode of Pleurisy. The results were the same. It completely eliminated the pain.	10	February 14, 2020	3
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	Went to pick up a large garbage bag full of glass bottles. The bag was probably around 50-60 lbs and I carried it with one hand while I maneuvered around my house with it. Walk to my car and up my stairs and boom!! Back gave out. Worst pain I have felt since fracturing my hand. Did the traditional icing, laying down and taking some leftover opioids so that I can walk to bathroom and kitchen. 3 days no change, back still slanted from the hip to the chest so I decided to go to urgent care. They gave me the shot of toradol and my pain when from 10 while standing/walking to a 3. Combined that with muscle relaxer my pain level is 1 right now because of random nerves shooting. I recommend to get this shot. I’m a 27 year old male	10	February 11, 2020	9
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Pain	I got this medication to help with my jaw and shooting teeth nerve pains as my doctor stopped prescribing T3s for the pain. I'd say my teeth pain level were at a 2/10 when on T3s and now using ketorolac pain is a 9/10. Doesn't do anything for severe nerve teeth pain. Plus I've read about people bleeding on the inside cuz of this drug which is sketchy as anything. I'll stick with my t3s thank you very much.	1	January 24, 2020	3
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	This medicine helps me tremendously with my lower back pain. It is given to me through a shot form. Although it makes me sleepy I would say it takes away my pain about 80%. Highly effective for me.	8	January 22, 2020	10
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	Burns my sinuses and gives me a wicked headache. Didn't even full my pain	1	January 19, 2020	2
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I have had 4 Torodal injections over the course of 10 months, the first 3 were for sciatica and the 4th one was for a ligament tear in my knee. The first 3 did wonders for me with no pain at the injection site and almost instant pain relief. However this last time was awful, the injection site burned so bad for around 2 hours, it took 4 hours to work and then I had terrible back pain for the next two days. It's definitely a hit or miss medication.	5	January 19, 2020	7
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	dr gave me a  toradol  shot  before a (medically necessary) 16w3d dilation and evacuation (D&E) to relieve pain during the procedure.  1- it stung for about 30 minutes, about the pain/intensity of a severe chemical burn.  2- it DID NOT provide any pain relief, I had to reschedule and return for a week later so they could figure out a safe way to sedate me with my previous bad reactions to sedatives.  3- the injection site still hurts, over a week after. It’s tender, sore all the time... I can’t lay on my left side (which is how I have slept for 20 years), It feels like there’s a bit of a lump at the site, and it hurts more when I walk because my muscles move. The pain from the D&E is already gone, and it’s only been 1 day with no pain meds whatsoever, not even a Tylenol or ibuprofen. But over a week after the injection and it still hurts excessively.	1	January 16, 2020	7
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I frequently suffer from Kidney Stones that ultimately pass. Christmas Eve I was hit with the worse back pain ever and my urine output was bright red blood. I was at the E.R within 30 minutes. I went through triage and they immediately gave me a shot of Toradol. Within 10 minutes the pain reduced to a very manageable “2.” A CAT-scan confirmed a 17.8 x 12.2 triangular stone that no way would pass. It was stuck at the urethra junction reducing my flow. No Urologist was available so they gave me another shot and sent me home with a prescription for five days. I reached a Urologist the day after Christmas and was immediately scheduled for surgery. Toradol kept me sane and able to focus for the three days. I dislike Opiates and would never accept Fentanyl or Morphine (which have both been offered in the past.)	8	January 3, 2020	8
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	I was prescribed this for post sub muscular ulnar nerve transposition. I was so annoyed I was prescribed this. I didn't get it till a week out and the first time I used it and it did nothing. Nothing more than stinging in my sinuses. I gave it another shot my back was acting up so I decided to try it. I used it as directed and it did nothing but make my nose run profusely. I started noticing an absolute monstrosity  of sinus headache which has me in agony. This is billed as Toradol for post op pain. It didn't even take away mild arthritis pain, or hardware pain. This is the *new* alternative? It sucks, and it is in the trash for me at least. It was NOT worth all I went through to get it.	1	January 1, 2020	3
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I was given Toradol when I had a severe kidney stone attack. It worked immediately, as well as a morphine injection had worked for an earlier kidney stone. I never go out of town without packing my Toradol. Reading these reviews indicates it doesn't work for everyone, but it was a God-send for me.	10	December 30, 2019	4
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Pain	OK. I was given toradol yesterday to use for a rescue medication when I have migraines. Yesterday was a nightmare as it was my first botox treatment and I took one of my toradol and my afternoon meds which I had to postpone for about a hour due to when I had to be at the neurologist. There is no recorded interaction between the two but I'm taking a pain pill and I'm getting worse? I was functional for a few hours this morning and then it showed back up. Repeat pattern and again my migraines were worse when I woke up! I had to break the no other nsaid rule and take 2 Excedrin to go along with it as I am that desperate. Take it with food? If I'm reaching for my rescue meds, 9 times out of 10 food ain't gonna be possible. Am I missing something that they didn't tell me about this medication?	4	December 25, 2019	0
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Postoperative Pain	ketorolac doesn’t do ANYTHING for dental pain. Advil was better, I’m in horrible pain and this drug is like taking nothing at all.	1	December 5, 2019	20
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	Went to urgent care with a migraine for the 3rd day. Got Toradol shot and its been 3 hours with NO relief.		December 2, 2019	7
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Pain	I received a shot into the muscles of my mid back.  Now there is a cord like lump along the injection site and it Is extremely painful.  I’ve had the pain now for 5 days and counting.  I will not get another injection of the medication again.	1	December 1, 2019	1
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	WHY is the pharmacy that dispenses this drug so hard to deal with? Always super long hold times & ignorant people who I can barely understand on the phone.  I don't have the medicine yet because after WEEKS of trying to get through, they told me my insurance needs prior authorization.   So annoyed.		November 20, 2019	1
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I constantly surprise medical staff when I tell them what drug always works.  I start to tell them, wait for the eye roll as they expect me to name some narcotic or opioid.  Nope, Toradol.   Headaches so bad I am literally throwing up, wearing sunglasses into the dr office and walk out smiling and pain free.    Amazing medicine!	10	November 14, 2019	11
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	I was prescribed this medication by my pain management doctor. Unfortunately the doctor didn't tell me how much to use so I called my pharmacist and asked him. He said 1 spray per nostril, which is what I did. No pain relief. I did more research this morning & found that the dosage is weight based. Over 50kg means that I need 2 sprays per nostril. Yes it does burn, but not for very long. I'd read all of the prescribing information that came with the medication so I knew about the nose burn, which will go away after time. I've been dealing with migraine pain, especially after having lidocaine shots over my eyebrows. This knocked down the migraine pain to tolerable. Unfortunately I can't find out how long this drug will stop my pain after I stop using it. I'm guessing that it must last for a while or the dosage would be higher. Unfortunately I started on a Friday night so I'll have to wait until Monday to call the company to get answers for my questions.	3	November 9, 2019	3
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	Today I got a toradol shot in my hip for my arthritis and Now the pain is 10 times worse it’s shooting down my leg and when she gave me the shot almost 10 mins later I passed out and my blood pressure dropped super low then the doctor let me drive home....?!	1	November 9, 2019	4
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Postoperative Pain	I just had 4 wisdom teeth removed along with an impacted second molar and was prescribed toradol. I have been amazed to say the least. I was expecting to be in horrible pain. I have about 8 stitches and all I have is sore gums, but that's to be expected. Going on day 2 and haven't had any problems.  I have been prescribed several narcotic pain meds that worked for a short period of time and had to take more. Toradol is a miracle drug and I would definitely recommend it over narcotic pain meds. I haven't had any bad side effects. Idk if people having hallucinations were taking something else with or prior to toradol or just adverse side effects.	10	November 5, 2019	7
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Pain	This drug acted no better than a sugar pill for my sciatica.	1	October 15, 2019	5
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I injured my back this weekend and endured the worst pain I’ve ever felt in my life. My lower back muscles cramped up so bad, I had ribs out, sharp pains, etc.. all at once. I went from fine to being in the floor in tears. The pain even got so bad that it made me sick twice. I finally went to the hospital yesterday because I couldn’t handle it anymore. I was in agony. After doing tests, they gave me a Toradol injection. I went from extremely heavy breathing and not even being able to talk or sit up from the pain being so bad to feeling back to normal in less than 10 minutes. It was like day and night. It was seriously a miracle and such a relief. I’m so grateful I was able to get this injection. I’m still recovering from my injury, but the inflammation went down so much and my chiropractor told me he doesn’t expect it to come back and said the Toradol  really helped. I’m just so happy with this medication that I had to leave a review. I definitely recommend it!	10	October 15, 2019	10
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Postoperative Pain	I was given IV Toradol in hospital. After 2 days of this drug I developed a severe gastric bleed. Do not take this drug.	1	October 14, 2019	11
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Pain	Cuttently taking toradol oral medication 10mg  for lower back pain, it makes me sleepy and physically relaxed but does absolutely nothing to help the actual pain. I can say that the toradol injection almost immediately stopped the pain completely for about 6 hours.	3	September 30, 2019	2
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Postoperative Pain	I was given Toradol following an appendectomy (via my IV) & was impressed with how well it worked. It did make me sleepy, but it also helped my stress-induced migraine! Will have to discuss this option with my neurologist.	9	September 21, 2019	11
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	I was prescribed this for chronic intractable migraine.  I’ve tried triptans, Botox, Aimovig, and nerve blocks.  Sprix will relieve my pain within one hour—I’ve gone  from not working and being laid up, to working 30-hrs per week.  It’s been life-changing.    You do have to follow the directions closely or you will have extreme burning in your nose and throat.  Once you get the hang of it using is much easier.  	9	September 20, 2019	10
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I got an Toradol injection in my hip to help with migraine pain, and I felt so tired all day afterwards. My stomach hurts, and my entire lower back is tensed up and cramping from the injection. I was worried about this, but I saw others posting about it. My migraine is gone but the side effects are uncomfortable. I could have dealt with the migraine pain instead of the side effects from the shot. I was too exhausted to function and get any work done all day.	8	September 18, 2019	2
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	This medication cannot be compared to any opioid or acetaminophen, because neither of those things reduce inflammation. This medication works against swelling and inflammation, which is why it works better for treating stuff like that. It can be used along with an opioid as well, if needed!! Depends on what you're treating. I see a lot of comments saying that this medication works better than opioids, there's a reason for that though!	10	September 14, 2019	7
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	"I suffer from upper back pain that occasionally flares up pretty bad that sends shooting pain into my left shoulder blade and this time up into my head. I had pain in the back on my head for about 3 weeks, then it moved to my left temple where it throbbed so bad, I finally went to the ER, they gave a muscle injection of Torodal and a Norflex (muscle relaxer) injection. The pain went from a 9 to a 1 within 15 minutes. Wish I would've went in sooner. I'm glad I figured out that this drug is an option. Normally ibuprofen works for me but sometimes it doesn't at all, the nurse said this is a ""souped up version"" of ibuprofen."	10	September 13, 2019	5
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	They gave me this Toradol shot and man this shot hurt me. I couldn't move my arm for an hour!!! And really didn't feel a significant relief I swear the shot was not worth my time !!!	1	September 12, 2019	15
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	The ER Dr gave me Toradol for L1 fracture pain. I hadn't slept in 48 hrs. It was useless.	1	September 9, 2019	11
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Pain	I have received this medication twice in my life now and both times it worked great to help relieve the pain from kidney stones. The anti inflammatory effects help a lot too to make the stone pass easier and a little faster. They gave me that and Dilaudid together. The pain was worse the second time I had my kidney stones, so it didn’t completely go away, but I went from like an 8 or 9 down to about a 3.	8	September 9, 2019	2
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	I suffer from severe chronic migraines that come with a variety of symptoms outside of pain. They're new to me, and so far I've found that I only have a very small window to take an oral abortive medication before they become ineffective and I'm left to wait out the migraine which becomes hard being a music student and always surrounded by sound and light. Being in college, I can't always get to my neurologist's office for injections either, which is when I was prescribed Sprix. After a week-long migraine, Sprix managed to cut my pain from a 7-8 range down to a 2-3 in only about ten minutes. It's difficult to administer at first, you have to angle the bottle right and hold your breath and make sure not to inhale it after for the next few minutes, but the discomfort is will worth the pain relief and so far minimal side effects. The second dose was easier than the first, and so far has helped just as much, and so far my other symptoms have been relieved along with the pain!	10	September 7, 2019	12

Acunivive 30 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	On 8/11/19 I was in a car accident. I was diagnosed with, Cervical Spine Sprain and Strain. Thoracic Spine Sprain, as well as a left hip strain. I’ve been to the ER twice. Along with the dr through my work as this accident happened while I was working. My second time in the ER was last night. They gave me IV Toradol, along with IV Valum. (I’m a cancer survivor so I’m also on Dilaudid and Gabapentin at home. I couldn’t get my pain under control with these medications.) I waited for my MRI and was in pain awful. Once this medication kicked in I was shocked at how well it worked!!! MRI  revealed that everything else is okay. However the dr said my muscles and tendons etc were so tight!!! This medication helped so much that it’s now the next day and thankful my muscle spams have not come back! I’d ask for this medication anyway before pain meds for my back pain!	10	August 23, 2019	9
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I have chronic pain every day with back problems and suffer migraines as well. I'm in pain management I do take opioids for my pain, but this morning terrible migraine 2 days in a row Dr got me in and gave me injection of toradol and instantly migraine gone and also helped with my back pain today. So from someone that takes pain meds and getting this injection I say wow Toradol does work!!!!!!!!	8	August 20, 2019	9
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	I have severe endometriosis pain and didn’t want to be on birth control. I also tried Orillisa and with that I traded one pain for another with extreme migraines. I had basically given up at that point until my doc told me to try Sprix. I was still skeptical but I said what do I have to loose so on my second day of extreme endo pain I tried it and when I tell u my pain was 95% gone ! I couldn’t believe it I'm still in shock this medication is something I cannot live without now I'm so happy	8	August 19, 2019	7
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Toradol IV/IM (ketorolac) for Pain	I just had an IV  with Toradol along with Magnesium at an   infusion center  for very nasty/chronic migraine & posterior cervical pain. As in the  past, I did not get NOT get very much relief. I got off OXYCod. 7.5 mg. because of my tolerance that one gets after longterm use. In pain almost every day ! Had cervical 4-level fusion  on Jan 28. Wish I never did ! Imitrex only helps migraine not the cervical/occipital pain daily. Anyone know how I can get pain relief! Tried many 'scripts over last 10+ yrs.  	3	August 12, 2019	0
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	I started using it for my sciatica pain and it helps tremendously!!  If it’s burning your nose off , reread the directions and try again. I’m grateful to have it.	8	August 12, 2019	8

Acunivive 30 Injection System	Postoperative Pain	Prescribed Ketorolac for pain and infection after having all teeth removed. Took forever to start working and when it did I still had a lot of pain.	4	August 1, 2019	7
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Toradol IV/IM (ketorolac) for Pain	I have severe migraines. Despite neurology shots in my head, neck and shoulders I still get migraines. I usually have sumatriptan pills to help at the start of one. But when caffeine and these don’t work, I take a ketoralac/tramadol shot IM at home. These help avoid ER visits and hospitalization. It takes about 15 minutes for it to really kick in, but the effect is almost immediate...as if the migraine never happened. When I did go to the ER, tramadol IV instantly removed any pain in my eyes, head and neck. I’ve had no side effects other than about 30 minutes of tenderness where I received the shot (upper arm).   This works for some and not others. Mine is only as needed for severe pain.	9	July 31, 2019	2
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I went to a carnival with my family and hurt my back on one of the rides. I found out later they weren't even supposed to let people on that part of the ride due to the possibility of injury. So I went to an urgent care clinic as soon as they were open cause my pain hadn't got any better. They gave me Toradol it hurt at the injection site and made my back pain about 2x worse than it already  was.  It took over an hour to kick in and only gave me relief for about 15 min I then had to wait 2 hrs at a hospital with orders for xrays in severe pain all because I live an hour away from the hospital. My husband called and complained about it and we found out that because we went in with orders we should have been seen right away. I'm stuck with a useless hospital system that taking over every clinic and service possible in my area.. And since we live in an area with a lot of addicts and pill seekers its impossible to get help when its really needed	1	July 23, 2019	19
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	I suffer from severe chronic daily (every single day!) migraines as well as Trigeminal Neuralgia types 1 & 2. Trigeminal Neuralgia is considered to be the worst possible pain a human can experience, is nicknamed “the suicide disease”, and is extremely difficult to manage. I am beyond grateful for this medication! It helps manage both conditions incredibly well. Someone here complained that it was like pouring acid up your nose and down your throat. They aren’t using it properly. It takes a while to get the hang of it (you have to to you head forward and DO NOT inhale!). The only negative is it can only be used sparingly, as an “emergency” medication for your worst days, because the most you can get is 5 vials per month. But I would be in an awful place without this. It makes me stop screaming out (truly) in Trigeminal pain. I dulls my worst migraines. You just learn to choose your battles. It is strong, effective medication for severe and exquisite pain. I highly recommend it.	10	July 23, 2019	18
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Postoperative Pain	This medication doesn't work for my pain, I don't want or need narcotics just want something to relieve my pain so I can slep	1	June 12, 2019	15
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I have shingles, these things always crop up on a weekend, when your primary care physician isn't available.

Acunivive 30 Injection System	Pain	I had severe back pain for over a year and this took it away completely when I got it. It has been a miracle for me. I would like to know if anyone takes this regularly? Twice a day? Is it dangerous to do this as this is what I’ve done for over a month and have had no side effects.	10	May 25, 2019	1
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	I don't know how it works for pain,  haven't given it enough time to tell.  But you may as well spray acid into your nose/sinuses/throat.... won't use twice.	5	May 15, 2019	5
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I was given IV Toradol for severe pain while in the ER after a bad neck injury .  The injection hurt my vein so bad I thought I was going to pass out.  Took all of my neck pain away for about 30 seconds, then I was back up to an 8.  I was really hoping it would work.	2	May 12, 2019	12
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	I was given this by my neurologist for migraines. I’m also an epileptic so  taking any new meds can cause my seizures to be worse. So it’s been sitting in my fridge for 3 weeks. 4 days ago I had a really bad seizure and with it came the horrible migraine. I took my first dose of Sprix and I felt like I had just spayed pepper spray up my nose! Omg!! It was like an instant panic attack from pain! Once the pain in my nose was gone (about 15 min) I noticed my migraine was almost completely gone. I had to talk myself into taking my second dose. But once I made it past the burn my migraine was completely gone, so yes the Sprix works great on migraines, it was amazing!! My issue is how healthy is this if it comes with that much pain.....?	7	May 10, 2019	11
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I was in the hospital for meningitis and all they would give me for pain was  this rubbish Toradol and Tylenol ! Really? I didn't receive any noticeable benefit from this medication and thanks to the opioid crisis this is all they would give me! I wouldn't give this stuff to my dog.	2	May 9, 2019	10

Acunivive 30 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	So my first dose was a quite uncomfortable burning sensation. Second dose was less burning 3rd and 4th dose for the day barely any burning at all. This has taken my pain from an 8-10 down to a 1-2 on the pain scale. I've used this medicine to treat my chronic low back pain myofascial pain syndrome chronic sciatica. The doctor has given me this to get me through until I can get to pain management. I'm already seeing fantastic results I might just continue what this medication.	10	May 2, 2019	14
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	I hate taking this. I mean hate taking it. It burns your nose, it usually makes me feel sick for a couple of days. But it helps so much with pain, even instantly. I would rather deal with a burning nose and sore throat than my fibromyalgia pain so I am grateful for this medication.	10	April 16, 2019	14

Acunivive 30 Injection System	Toradol IV/IM (ketorolac) for Pain	Toradol makes me feel pretty strange and out of it for a few days. It works for post-procedure pain, but I honestly don't know if it's any more effective than just taking ibuprofen. Regardless, I'd rather deal with a headache after my procedure than feel weird and in pain for a few days.	5	March 16, 2019	1
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I pulled the stent from my ureter after having a stone removed and within minutes I was in severe pain. After 2 hours of worsening pain I drove to the urologists office and begged to help relieve the enormous treachery I was enduring. They gave me a shot to my hip and within minutes the pain level dropped from 9 to a 5. The relief was a Godsend. The anti-inflammatory in the drug opened the ureter and allowed blood clots and other debris to filter into the bladder. I was then prescribed toradol in pill form. This got me through the horrific ordeal I had experienced. 	10	February 16, 2019	12
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	I was skeptical and apprehensive about using this medicine after my hip replacement surgery, so for the first 13 days I avoided it. I take piroxicam for my cervical spondylosis and as the days went on the pain in my neck became unbearable, yet my hip pain was minimal. I wasn't able to take the piroxicam with the aspirin I was taking as a blood thinner. This resulted in extreme neck pain and migraine headaches that were debilitating.  I gave in and took the Sprix for the first time when on day 14 I just couldn't function. The pain in my neck and head was intolerable so I had to do something. I took it and within 20 minutes or less the pain had moderated to a level I could stand. Within an hour it was almost completely gone.  I am now a believer. Glad I tried it!	10	February 11, 2019	17
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	This medicine has helped me tremendously with migraines and fibromyalgia. I am unable to take Maxalt or similar drugs due to a reaction so this has been an absolute lifesaver for me!	10	February 4, 2019	9
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I was given a toradol shot for severe sciatica pain.  Might as well have given me an injection of water--NO pain relief whatsoever.	1	February 4, 2019	20
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Toradol IV/IM (ketorolac) for Pain	I had my first kidney stone (I didn't know a human could feel such pain, writhing on the floor, etc.). I got an IV dose of Toradol in the ambulance, and a Toradol pill in the ER. Neither had any effect on the pain. About two hours later, the stone passed on its own, and the pain vanished.	1	January 28, 2019	1
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Toradol IV/IM (ketorolac) for Pain	"Let me see. Toradol? It's a joke. 56 surgeries, body parts that are not mine, shot, stabbed and blown up. 30 years USMC, oh, and I am now told I have CRPS. McGill Pain Scale  is a 1, a ONE for CRPS. Due to all of the surgeries from trauma I have received far too much morphine. Can't tolerate any med but IM demerol for pain. Why this rubbish is even on the market amazes me. Perhaps it is to make the morons we, well some of us, call ""doctor"" feel even more important. Toradol is a waste of $$$ and time."	1	January 24, 2019	0
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Postoperative Pain	I had knee replacement surgery and was given a Hydrocodone combination along with a Ketorolac prescription after leaving the hospital. It worked better on my pain than the opioids prescribed. I did not have any side effects. Wonderful drug.	10	January 11, 2019	2
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	I have to agree with a few others I also wish this could be used for more days than five.  I have fibromyalgia and polio, sprix works great for me I have not experienced burning in my nose or throat as of yet.  I do hope they read the reviews so they can see this medication has helped a lot of us! For me I'm glad I gave this a try 	10	January 9, 2019	12
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I suffer from Chronic kidney stones.  The first time I was given Tordol interveniously and it literally worked within a minute!! I was in so much pain and vomiting from the pain. After the Tordol it relieved the kidney pain immediately.  Now when I’m rushed to hospital or walk in clinic, it’s the first thing I ask for! I’ve never had it as a shot in my muscle, so I can’t give my opinion, but through an IV was awesome. I have had no side effects from it either!		January 7, 2019	8
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Toradol IM (ketorolac) for Pain	I had fallen the day before and ended up the next day with back spasms. These aren't just little twinges, they are like someone is sticking a knife in my back. They are the worst!! I sent in to the doctor's office and they gave me a shot of Toradol. I got absolutely no relief at all. Might as well have been a placebo. I didn't have any side effects from it, which is unusual for me.  My spasms lasted for 12 hours straight before stopping.	1	January 3, 2019	2
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	I have not found that Sprix is very helpful for me. I felt no change in my pain relief. The burning that some have mentioned was not that bad to me. Don't sniff it in. That's not how you are supposed to take it. Make sure to watch the video and it shows exactly how to do it!	3	December 18, 2018	6
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	I'm 38 and have had occasional headaches most of my life.  This is the 1st drug that has been this effective.	10	December 11, 2018	6
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I have chronic kidney stones and they always want to give me toradol IM for the pain. First off, the standards for what constitutes a properly sized muscle need to be reviewed, because 1/3 of the time, they'll give it to me in the deltoid, while the rest of the time, they insist on the gluteus medius. Regardless of where they put it, it doesn't help much with the problem at hand. If I happen to have a headache or sore back at the time, the toradol clears it right up. The severe pain it's meant to treat, on the other hand, barely has the edge taken off. The worst thing is that it causes intense soreness and cramping in the injection site for hours, far worse than a tetanus shot. Some people have good experiences, so it's worth a try to dodge opioids, but don't be afraid to tell them it doesn't work.	3	November 29, 2018	8
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I have MS and pinched nerve in my C spine . When I have a flare up or bad spasticity this drug works great ! Go in , get a shot and literally 1 minute later the pain is relieved .	10	November 29, 2018	3
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	I’ve suffered with migraines for over 10 years. I’ve taken everything and done all kinds of treatment. Including Botox. This nasal spray works within 10 mins. It does burn your nose pretty bad and leaves a horrible taste in your throat. But ..... it’s amazing. My only complaint is once you’ve opened a small bottle you have to dispose in 24hrs. I’ve tried to keep them longer and the medicine just doesn’t work after that time period. I would highly recommend this to anyone with chronic migraines. It had been a life saver	10	November 28, 2018	10
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	They gave me this drug for a pulled muscle in my back, it helped with the pain, but the side effects were not worth it, terrible stomach pain, burning in my stomach, belching, bloating, 3 days since the injection, and my stomach is still not back to normal, I will never take this drug again	1	November 9, 2018	8
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Toradol IM (ketorolac) for Pain	Went to my Primary Care with extreme, crippling menstrual pain (I have cysts and endometriosis). Nurse injected in my arm, I am routinely used to injections and I've never felt such pain from a needle in my life.  My entire arm went numb, I couldn't feel my hand. Then, for a long while afterwards I kept getting shockwaves up and down my arm, like bees stinging inside of my nerves. Not sure if this was the drug or malpractice? Minutes later I was vomiting profusely in the office wastebasket. My arm then developed a large, red circular rash. Apparently this is not a normal reaction. Once I was home, I also got a hideous migraine as a side effect. The drug did relieve my cramps, and knocked me out for a good several hours, but it wasn't worth the headache or the pain in my arm. Never again.	1	October 25, 2018	1
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I had a heart attack in March 2018. In the hospital, they were giving me Morphine for pain. I hated the way it made me feel and it did nothing for the pain. After a day of Morphine I asked that I be given something else, thus my introduction to Toradol. I wish I'd known about Toradol before being given Morphine. It made me feel so much better, without the horrible side effects of Morphine.	10	October 24, 2018	9
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Postoperative Pain	This was given to me after multiple surgeries stemming from a botched gallbladder removal. This drug gave me horrible hallucinations and extremely vivid dreams. It scared me to death out and made me sweat profusely. I don’t ever want anything to do with this drug again.	1	October 3, 2018	6
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Toradol IM (ketorolac) for Pain	Received IM injection. No relief of pain. Caused pain, paresthesia, hyperesthesia and numbness from hip injection site to lateral knee. This persists 6 weeks later. Experienced nausea and violent vomiting for 12 hours as well. I will not take this again	1	September 28, 2018	2
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I get a toradol shot when I get a migraine that lasts longer than a day and when naproxen hasn't help. I have had them help and sometimes they do not.   Got one today and the pain was gone within an hour. Plus the nurse did a great job, no burning sensation after injection. I have been lucky lately, not having a bad burning sensation. I once had a nurse inject it quickly and had the worst burning sensation from it. I think when it is injected slower it's better.   Overall the toradol shot is good for me. I also take hydroxyzine (anti anxiety, antihistamine) at onset of migraine too.  The NASID and antihistamine work very well for me.	9	September 28, 2018	9
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	They always try to give me this when I have a migraine. It has never worked for my pain. They still make me try it before they will even consider giving me anything else. It is no better than 800mg of Advil or Cambia. And I can take that stuff at home without having to pay a copay! So frustrating that this is the first line of defence for a migraine that won’t go away.	2	September 18, 2018	8
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Toradol IV/IM (ketorolac) for Pain	I suffer from severe nerve and back pain. When my gabapentin and norcos can't cut it I go to the ER and get a shot of toradol. I will have electric shooting pains that go down my leg and out my foot every few minutes. 60 mg of Toradol will have me pain-free within an hour. I have gone several times so far. One flare-up was so bad that the shot only stopped it for 24 hrs and I had to go back the next day and get another. Then I was good for a few months till the next bad flare up	10	September 6, 2018	4
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	Toradol right into my sciatic nerve worked for 18 months. Tonight they want to put toradol in my shoulder.  Seems dumb to put toradol into my bloodstream and not where the pain is.		September 6, 2018	4
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	Used this post hip labrum and FAI arthroscopic surgery. Works incredibly well. Never needed to supplement the narcotic pain pills they prescribed. Took Sprix with Tylenol and with ice every hour I was virtually pain free.	10	September 2, 2018	6
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	I had a Superior Hypogastric Plexus Block aka a giant needle guided by x-ray though muscles and spine to numb some nerves for my chronic endometriosis pain. I was given SPRIX to help in my recovery from the injection and it did nothing but make me nauseous. If it helped with the pain I couldn't tell. I think Percocet would do better than this NSAID-SPRIX.  Note: I've got a tolerance for strong meds so it takes a lot of anything to help me when I have severe pain. I think it might help others but isn't strong enough for me.  My dosage was 15.75mg spray in each nose every 6-8 hours. The burn hurts bad, makes me cry and sometimes makes me sneeze. After 1 day of usage with no relief I'm calling my Dr for something else.  FYI: On the other hand this block I get does help my endometriosis pain after the recovery from the injection itself. If you happen to have chronic endo. pain I can recommend this shot.	1	September 1, 2018	3
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	I’ve had Kidney stones for 25 years. I’m now 42. Having a stone 2-5 times a year really sucks. Only a couple years ago my doctor RX’d me Sprix. Yes, it kind of burns the nose a little and drips down your throat and taste horrible . Chase it with some water. It absolutely takes to pain away in a matter of 5-15 minutes tops. So much better than Dilaudid 4mg. Wish I had this years ago. So much easier than having narcotics.	10	August 28, 2018	7
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I got a injection of Toradol when I was admitted the night before I gotten my gallbladder out. I was in so much pain and Dilaudid only helped me for a hour at the most. My nurse finally gave me a shot of Toradol and I could finally sleep. Having a gallstones attack was the worst pain I have ever felt in my life. It lasted until I woke up after surgery and was in my room. I am so grateful that it helped!	10	August 25, 2018	4
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Toradol IM (ketorolac) for Pain	I was in #9+ pain after a cervical (SPINE) nerve cauterizing procedure, (in addition to migraine) & was highly distressed  to get ZERO pain relief.  The drive/additional nausea/pain/stress to get the Toradol shot caused WORSE pain than if I'd known Toradol was the only remedy offered. Toradol is not effective for me at all!	1	August 23, 2018	2
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	I absolutely wish there was a formulation I could take for more than 5 days. If I could take this every day, I could probably go off of my narcotic pain meds. I will agree with many, the taste and burning can be hard but it’s definitely worth it. At least for me.	10	August 19, 2018	8
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	"As most have stated this burns terribly, however I DO NOT CARE! I would take worse pain if its something that will elevate my migraines. I am on a whole host of meds, and I hate medication. I prefer natural means, however nothing worked so here I am. I will do anything to rid myself of these migraines. I have had nerve blocks and a few times gone to the ER for a ""migraine cocktail"" this medication has replaced that need. When living with a violent migraine for 21 days, I would try anything! Having this on hand eliminates that possibility. This DOES WORK! Just push through the initial nose burn and move on. As stated I do not like medication, I have resigned myself to that not being the case, but I do push my limits. I only use this as a last resort and only after a few days of trying everything else.  I hope my rant encourages you to stick through the nose pain. If you do....a clear and quiet mind with NO PAIN, PUKING, LOSS OF VISION, it legit gives you your life back with in a few mins."	8	August 15, 2018	9
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I got a shot of toradol after I went to ER for nerve pain. As soon as she stabbed it in my arm I felt pain. My hand is cramping and have tingling all over my body.	1	August 4, 2018	5
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I had daily headaches resulting from a concussion. A neurologist put me on Toradol and I could not wait to wean myself off. I had such stabbing pain in both eyes from it I could barely function. I now take Elavil and am very excited not to have headaches! Fingers crossed!		July 26, 2018	6
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	Toradol worked right away on back pain.  The shot hurt a bit,  but now, the next morning, I can't go to work as I have got  diarrhea, chills and fever, heartburn. Just like the side effect list.	9	July 25, 2018	4
Acunivive 30 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	Sprix burns my nose HORRIBLY! Even if I don’t inhale it later after I sniff just a little it burns every sinus cavity and makes my eyes water and burn. Then when I finally lay back down it burns my throat for about 30 minutes. It feels like I’m shoving jalapeños up my nose and in my sinus cavities. As for the pain it doesn’t help there either. Maybe this medicine is just not for me.	1	July 8, 2018	1
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	Went into the ER on Friday April 23 for chest and left arm pain, was given a Toradol injection in my left arm, burned like anything, kind of like 3 bees stung me. It eased the pain for a little, from about a 10 to a 7 in pain level , it is now Sunday and I still feel the stinging sensation in my arm and the pain has gone down all the way to my left rib cage,  now, my chest is just fine, but now I have this damn pain from the injection. I have been placing a cold ice pack and it helps a little , at night pain gets worse where I had the injection.  I honestly don't recommend Toradol it hurts like anything.	1	April 26, 2021	0
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	Woke up with severe stomach, flank, and left sided back pain. About 5 days of horrific pain scheduled doctor's visit. He then sent me to the ER. Was kept in the ER for over 8 hours. Given IV meds that got rid of pain for a short period of time, but made me itch horribly. Went back to my PCP and was told I had diverticulitis and possibly triggered my degenerate disc disease  Given antibiotics and an injection of toradol.  Heavens above my pain is gone. Prescription toradol every 6 hours PRN. I am so grateful. This has got to be a wonder drug. Hope I can heal and pain stays at bay	10	April 25, 2021	0
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I went into the ER because of a seven day long migraine. They gave me a shot of Toradol. Within one hour my entire abdomen was painfully heaving and cramping about every 1 to 2 minutes. For the first five days I couldn’t eat, and I couldn’t sit down, because sitting made it worse. So I paced my house until I was so exhausted that I could nap. Then I would wake up in the middle of the night and continue to pace until I was so exhausted I could go back to sleep again.   That severe heaving and cramping continued for five straight weeks. It took three different medication‘s to get it to stop.  It was the most torturous time of my entire life. I could barely sleep, and I couldn’t work.  Now, I can’t even take Advil. It causes the same response. (Before the Toradol I took Advil all the time with positive results.)	1	April 21, 2021	0
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Toradol IM (ketorolac) for Pain	I have arachnoiditis, which is inflammation of the arachnoid layer of the covering of the spinal cord. I have 24/7 intractable pain for which I am on injectable dilaudid. When my pain flares even the dilaudid doesn’t work. Enter Toredol which saves my life. I inject 30 mg at home every other day when I’m flaring. Can’t take more than that because it is bad for your GI tract if you take too long. It is a God send.	10	March 24, 2021	0
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	Went to the ER for awful lower abdominal pain. Was given Toradol intravenously and my pain did not go away. I felt no different in terms of pain. I did get a little sleep but that is it. ☹️	1	March 14, 2021	0
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	If you have Eosinophilic esophagitis (EOE)....DO NOT TAKE OR ACCEPT THIS DRUG!!!! I went into the ER for arm & chest pain. (No heart attack...I believe it was my EOE causing spasming) The dr didn’t bat an eye when I told him I have EOE. I got the injection form & right off the bat started having issues with it. It also did diddly squat for the pain that I went in for.  I told the dr I wasn’t feeling right (sick to my stomach & dizzy at the time). He took my oxygen level & then gave me my discharge papers. That night, stomach pain. The next day, stomach pain & my body felt super fidgety on the inside. The next day, back in the ER because my stomach pain was getting worse along with my tremors. 5 days later, I’m still having tremors. My stomach is still hurting.  Going off the side effect list, I’ve had quite a few of the reactions listed. This is definitely a no go for me ever again!!!!! I went in the ER for one issue & came out with another.	1	March 12, 2021	0
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Pain	This medicine is so amazing the way it blocks the pain receptors. Incredible job creating this! This medication is a God send!	10	February 21, 2021	0
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	Went to Urgent Care for back pain. The Toradol did not work. The pain did not lessen at all. What a waste of money	1	February 18, 2021	2
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	OMG this is THE BEST pain reliever I’ve had. It even worked better than the IV fentanyl that was ordered following a shoulder surgery. If I could take it every day, I would, but it’s dangerous, and the restrictions are for patient safety. But if it’s an option for pain relief, I’ll take it over a narcotic any day.	10	February 15, 2021	6
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I have Ehlers Danlos Syndrome (EDS) but currently have an infected tooth. (Tooth pain is the worst pain possible imo) Pain so bad, beats per minute was 168. Went to ER, Dr rx Toradol. Never had it as am allergic to NSAIDS. (not even sure if its ok for me?) A few minutes after it was administrated via IV, I started having a severe headache along with pain down my neck. It did absolutely nothing to lower the excruciating tooth pain either. I'm on long term pain meds for my EDS (10+ years) I assumed my meds weren't working due to the bad infection. Was sent home from ER in worse pain. Later began having constant severe upper stomach pain after I got home. The horrible effects lasted hours. Finally took one of my normal pain meds in the evening, and it alleviated the headache & stomach pain, plus also somehow still worked 1000 times better for my tooth than Toradol. Doctors can do better but they are scared.	1	February 8, 2021	1
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Postoperative Pain	I was prescribed oral keterolac 10 mg for my impacted wisdom tooth removal. I get about an hour of relief, and then the pain is unimaginable. Useless.	1	January 19, 2021	10
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I’ve had toradol in an IV twice in the last year at two different ER’s. May as well have handed me one aleve. So, now I have to sit with this excruciating pain for the foreseeable future. Toradol does not work. At all. But does make doctors very proud of themselves for not prescribing an opiate, which would be the thing that would actually help. I hurt all over. This pain is worse the childbirth but hey, who cares, right?	1	January 5, 2021	13
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I had an IV vitamin infusion about an hour after a root canal. She added Toradol to the IV. For the first day and a half, I had absolutely ZERO pain from the procedure. I could hardly even tell where I had several injections in my mouth. After a day and a half, I started noticing little aches and pains in my mouth from the injections and holding my mouth open for so long. This shows me that the Toradol worked amazingly well until it was all out of my system. I’ll have this done EVERY time I have painful dental work from now on!	10	January 1, 2021	3
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Pain	This drug is a joke ketorolac 10 milligram mg oral tablets. The only way I feel them is if I'm lucky enough to have a narcotic with them because it is an NSAID and does help reduce inflammation that being said it doesn't touch my broken fingers pain. Per Hospital requirement no pain meds unless broken.. I was hoping it would not be broken since it was I was prescribed ketorolac and morphine immediate-release and I feel great this happened Christmas Eve so I'm only 2 Days In. But when I use the ketorolac during the day without the morphine immediate-release there is no effect so I have to tough it out because they only give you a couple days worth of pain meds and you're done and I'm not looking to get hooked anyways so unfortunately ketorolac is what they're giving you for inflammation. I got to go see a hand specialist I have no insurance that makes it very expensive and hard to do especially during a pandemic	3	December 26, 2020	1
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Pain	Have an arthritic thumb. Doc prescribed Ketorolac. Twice a day for 10 days, 10 mg. After three days, I woke up with a loud ringing in my ears. Found out that it’s a side affect. Now have trouble sleeping because my ears are ringing so loud and my thumb is still painful. Wish I never took this nasty drug.	1	December 24, 2020	1
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	When I used Sprix to treat my migraines, I was quite shocked over the severe burning pain it caused in my nose. The burning was far worse than the migraine and I could not keep using this without lidocaine nasal gel or spray.   At the time I bought Sprix, I did not have any drug coverage from my health insurance. Shockingly, a 1 month prescription cost me over $500.00 U.S. dollars!! When I asked to be switched to generic oral Toral (Ketorolac) tablets, the same month's supply and dosage cost me about $20.00 U.S. dollars. Oral ketorolac worked equally effectively to the Sprix nasal spray in terms of analgesia, drug onset time, and duration. I have gastroparesis (stomach paralysis), which can delay oral meds from reaching my intestine, but found that the 20-40 minute onset helped.  My bottom line is to avoid Sprix nasal spray as it is grossly overpriced and it causes such severe burning pain in the nose that Sprix scares away the migraine.	7	November 4, 2020	4
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	As a 5'0, 87lbs woman age 21 who suffers from Endometriosis pains, muscle soreness and runners' knee, I decided the burning bloody nose was worth the trouble. I have yet to see a significant change in mobility but again it's worth it if your insurance covers it. When is the average time to feel the real effects of the drug and is anyone else sneezing it out?	7	October 30, 2020	1
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Postoperative Pain	Post-op major orthopedic surgery, Toradol was great pain management, moderate nausea, mild tinnitus, mild headache and decreased urination. I can function better than when I’ve taken opioids. Sedation is transient about 90 minutes after dose. 10/10	10	October 12, 2020	4
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Toradol IV/IM (ketorolac) for Pain	I had a severe toothache and got Toradol IV/IM in the ER. I honestly didn't think it would work but it did. Thankful for this medicine!!!	10	October 11, 2020	1
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Pain	Prescribed for dental pain that is a 9/10 and this brought it down to a 8/10 for an hour. Honestly the Advil worked better. No relief.	1	October 3, 2020	1
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	"I find Sprix to be helpful for migraine and neck pain. Make sure to read the instructions carefully. Should be sprayed TO THE SIDE of inside the nostril, and not inhaled; breathe through mouth a few minutes, and this reduces the burning. Can use same bottle up to 24 hours; don't put in fridge after using.  Can apply every 6 to 8 hours. My doc didn't say whether to do one or both nostrils, so I tried one the first time and it helped. The second migraine episode, headache was worse, so I  tried both nostrils, and it helped. I'm a woman, age 58, height 5'5"" and weigh 145 lbs."	9	September 25, 2020	8
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Pain	Prescribed ketorolac 10mg by dentist for the time before my tooth could be pulled. Taking it has no effect. Not even the smallest dent in the pain.	1	September 14, 2020	2
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	Toradol was prescribed at an urgent care center.  I’m 70 years old.  The medication relieved pain in my jaw due to a tooth issue.  During the past 5 months I’ve had 3 root canals and a bone graft for the problem.  Toradol worked quickly and allowed me to sleep.  Very helpful!  I received it by injection.	10	August 30, 2020	3
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Pain	I bailed on my skateboard a week or so ago and cracked a couple ribs. The doctor prescribed this to me @10mg 4x daily as needed.  It has done nothing  for the pain. I take it and still feel just as much pain as not taking it.	1	August 30, 2020	2
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	Thank goodness for Toradol! This is what I ask for when I have a chronic migraine. I am writing this now after a trip to urgent care. It does not take the pain away completely but makes it manageable. Just wanted to share because the pain can be agonizing and I hate for anyone to suffer.	10	August 23, 2020	12
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Pain	This drug ketorolac IS HORRIBLE!!! I had surgery last week and they started with an IV then pills when I went home. Nothing helped when I took them, this medicine made me hurt in my stomach worse and I have severe swelling and cramping, sweating, omg I will wake up wet...this medicine is AWFUL...I shouldn't just took 600 mg of Ibuprofen.	1	August 12, 2020	5
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	When you use the nasal spray you have to point the tip to the side of your nose not up still burns for a few seconds but really helped my pain . Reduced it by 50 percent		July 24, 2020	0
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Toradol IV/IM (ketorolac) for Pain	Had a kidney stone last night. In severe pain I went to a local ER. They gave me Toradol IV with absolutely zero pain relief. Later on Morphine did the trick.	1	May 11, 2020	2
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I have a severe case of mono and my tonsils swelled up to the point of not being able to swallow, talk and could barely breathe. was in 9/10 pain and swallowing felt like swallowing knives which is very unbearable. I was given steroids and toradol shot to reduce swelling and for pain. The injection itself was very uncomfortable but within 15 mins I was able to move and open my mouth and it took away my my pain to where I was finally able to swallow solid foods!! I'd say it lasted about 6 hours. It did make me a little drowsy which was nice bc U hadn’t been able to sleep. My arm is still very sore from the injection but was so worth it!!	10	March 16, 2020	5
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I’m a recovering addict (8 years clean) So I can’t risk taking opioids. Thought that I tore ligaments behind my knee, was in constant pain for 3 days before finally I couldn’t take it and went to the VA hospital ER.  Turned out I had a massive blood clot and was immediately given a shot of Toradol in my ass cheek for the pain. About 20 minutes later in the blink of an eye my pain vanished.  Just gone, for about 12 hours.  Something morphine and oxy failed to do after earning 2 Purple Hearts.	10	March 9, 2020	28
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I fractured my L1 vertebrae and got a Toradol injection at the urgent care - the doctor then gave me a three day supply of pills of Toradol 10 mg three times a day - it really did nothing to relieve my pain. I’m going to the orthopedic spine doctor tomorrow and hopefully he can prescribe something that will relieve the pain until the fracture heals	1	March 8, 2020	8
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	Awful nasal pain and caused a horrible headache. Nose burned so bad that my eyes watered and nose wouldn’t stop running. Will never use again. Prefer the toradol injection much more over this! Didn’t even touch my joint pain.	1	February 22, 2020	3
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	No pain relief with Toradol  at all for sciatica back, hip, groin and leg pain. Absolutely NONE,	1	February 21, 2020	20
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Pain	I have frequent and relatively small (5mm) oxalate kidney stones. Despite their small size they produce incredible pain and cramping as they travel down the Ureter. The IV Toradol (ketorolac) that they give me in the ER has never failed to completely eliminate the pain for up to 12 hours. If they could prescribe it in the IV form for home use I would gladly use it until the stone passes.  I've also received Toradol (ketorolac) for an episode of Pleurisy. The results were the same. It completely eliminated the pain.	10	February 14, 2020	3
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	Went to pick up a large garbage bag full of glass bottles. The bag was probably around 50-60 lbs and I carried it with one hand while I maneuvered around my house with it. Walk to my car and up my stairs and boom!! Back gave out. Worst pain I have felt since fracturing my hand. Did the traditional icing, laying down and taking some leftover opioids so that I can walk to bathroom and kitchen. 3 days no change, back still slanted from the hip to the chest so I decided to go to urgent care. They gave me the shot of toradol and my pain when from 10 while standing/walking to a 3. Combined that with muscle relaxer my pain level is 1 right now because of random nerves shooting. I recommend to get this shot. I’m a 27 year old male	10	February 11, 2020	9
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Pain	I got this medication to help with my jaw and shooting teeth nerve pains as my doctor stopped prescribing T3s for the pain. I'd say my teeth pain level were at a 2/10 when on T3s and now using ketorolac pain is a 9/10. Doesn't do anything for severe nerve teeth pain. Plus I've read about people bleeding on the inside cuz of this drug which is sketchy as anything. I'll stick with my t3s thank you very much.	1	January 24, 2020	3
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	This medicine helps me tremendously with my lower back pain. It is given to me through a shot form. Although it makes me sleepy I would say it takes away my pain about 80%. Highly effective for me.	8	January 22, 2020	10
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	Burns my sinuses and gives me a wicked headache. Didn't even full my pain	1	January 19, 2020	2
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I have had 4 Torodal injections over the course of 10 months, the first 3 were for sciatica and the 4th one was for a ligament tear in my knee. The first 3 did wonders for me with no pain at the injection site and almost instant pain relief. However this last time was awful, the injection site burned so bad for around 2 hours, it took 4 hours to work and then I had terrible back pain for the next two days. It's definitely a hit or miss medication.	5	January 19, 2020	7
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	dr gave me a  toradol  shot  before a (medically necessary) 16w3d dilation and evacuation (D&E) to relieve pain during the procedure.  1- it stung for about 30 minutes, about the pain/intensity of a severe chemical burn.  2- it DID NOT provide any pain relief, I had to reschedule and return for a week later so they could figure out a safe way to sedate me with my previous bad reactions to sedatives.  3- the injection site still hurts, over a week after. It’s tender, sore all the time... I can’t lay on my left side (which is how I have slept for 20 years), It feels like there’s a bit of a lump at the site, and it hurts more when I walk because my muscles move. The pain from the D&E is already gone, and it’s only been 1 day with no pain meds whatsoever, not even a Tylenol or ibuprofen. But over a week after the injection and it still hurts excessively.	1	January 16, 2020	7
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I frequently suffer from Kidney Stones that ultimately pass. Christmas Eve I was hit with the worse back pain ever and my urine output was bright red blood. I was at the E.R within 30 minutes. I went through triage and they immediately gave me a shot of Toradol. Within 10 minutes the pain reduced to a very manageable “2.” A CAT-scan confirmed a 17.8 x 12.2 triangular stone that no way would pass. It was stuck at the urethra junction reducing my flow. No Urologist was available so they gave me another shot and sent me home with a prescription for five days. I reached a Urologist the day after Christmas and was immediately scheduled for surgery. Toradol kept me sane and able to focus for the three days. I dislike Opiates and would never accept Fentanyl or Morphine (which have both been offered in the past.)	8	January 3, 2020	8
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	I was prescribed this for post sub muscular ulnar nerve transposition. I was so annoyed I was prescribed this. I didn't get it till a week out and the first time I used it and it did nothing. Nothing more than stinging in my sinuses. I gave it another shot my back was acting up so I decided to try it. I used it as directed and it did nothing but make my nose run profusely. I started noticing an absolute monstrosity  of sinus headache which has me in agony. This is billed as Toradol for post op pain. It didn't even take away mild arthritis pain, or hardware pain. This is the *new* alternative? It sucks, and it is in the trash for me at least. It was NOT worth all I went through to get it.	1	January 1, 2020	3
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I was given Toradol when I had a severe kidney stone attack. It worked immediately, as well as a morphine injection had worked for an earlier kidney stone. I never go out of town without packing my Toradol. Reading these reviews indicates it doesn't work for everyone, but it was a God-send for me.	10	December 30, 2019	4
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Pain	OK. I was given toradol yesterday to use for a rescue medication when I have migraines. Yesterday was a nightmare as it was my first botox treatment and I took one of my toradol and my afternoon meds which I had to postpone for about a hour due to when I had to be at the neurologist. There is no recorded interaction between the two but I'm taking a pain pill and I'm getting worse? I was functional for a few hours this morning and then it showed back up. Repeat pattern and again my migraines were worse when I woke up! I had to break the no other nsaid rule and take 2 Excedrin to go along with it as I am that desperate. Take it with food? If I'm reaching for my rescue meds, 9 times out of 10 food ain't gonna be possible. Am I missing something that they didn't tell me about this medication?	4	December 25, 2019	0
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Postoperative Pain	ketorolac doesn’t do ANYTHING for dental pain. Advil was better, I’m in horrible pain and this drug is like taking nothing at all.	1	December 5, 2019	20

Acunivive 60 Injection System	Pain	I received a shot into the muscles of my mid back.  Now there is a cord like lump along the injection site and it Is extremely painful.  I’ve had the pain now for 5 days and counting.  I will not get another injection of the medication again.	1	December 1, 2019	1
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	WHY is the pharmacy that dispenses this drug so hard to deal with? Always super long hold times & ignorant people who I can barely understand on the phone.  I don't have the medicine yet because after WEEKS of trying to get through, they told me my insurance needs prior authorization.   So annoyed.		November 20, 2019	1
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I constantly surprise medical staff when I tell them what drug always works.  I start to tell them, wait for the eye roll as they expect me to name some narcotic or opioid.  Nope, Toradol.   Headaches so bad I am literally throwing up, wearing sunglasses into the dr office and walk out smiling and pain free.    Amazing medicine!	10	November 14, 2019	11
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	I was prescribed this medication by my pain management doctor. Unfortunately the doctor didn't tell me how much to use so I called my pharmacist and asked him. He said 1 spray per nostril, which is what I did. No pain relief. I did more research this morning & found that the dosage is weight based. Over 50kg means that I need 2 sprays per nostril. Yes it does burn, but not for very long. I'd read all of the prescribing information that came with the medication so I knew about the nose burn, which will go away after time. I've been dealing with migraine pain, especially after having lidocaine shots over my eyebrows. This knocked down the migraine pain to tolerable. Unfortunately I can't find out how long this drug will stop my pain after I stop using it. I'm guessing that it must last for a while or the dosage would be higher. Unfortunately I started on a Friday night so I'll have to wait until Monday to call the company to get answers for my questions.	3	November 9, 2019	3
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	Today I got a toradol shot in my hip for my arthritis and Now the pain is 10 times worse it’s shooting down my leg and when she gave me the shot almost 10 mins later I passed out and my blood pressure dropped super low then the doctor let me drive home....?!	1	November 9, 2019	4
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Postoperative Pain	I just had 4 wisdom teeth removed along with an impacted second molar and was prescribed toradol. I have been amazed to say the least. I was expecting to be in horrible pain. I have about 8 stitches and all I have is sore gums, but that's to be expected. Going on day 2 and haven't had any problems.  I have been prescribed several narcotic pain meds that worked for a short period of time and had to take more. Toradol is a miracle drug and I would definitely recommend it over narcotic pain meds. I haven't had any bad side effects. Idk if people having hallucinations were taking something else with or prior to toradol or just adverse side effects.	10	November 5, 2019	7
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Pain	This drug acted no better than a sugar pill for my sciatica.	1	October 15, 2019	5
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I injured my back this weekend and endured the worst pain I’ve ever felt in my life. My lower back muscles cramped up so bad, I had ribs out, sharp pains, etc.. all at once. I went from fine to being in the floor in tears. The pain even got so bad that it made me sick twice. I finally went to the hospital yesterday because I couldn’t handle it anymore. I was in agony. After doing tests, they gave me a Toradol injection. I went from extremely heavy breathing and not even being able to talk or sit up from the pain being so bad to feeling back to normal in less than 10 minutes. It was like day and night. It was seriously a miracle and such a relief. I’m so grateful I was able to get this injection. I’m still recovering from my injury, but the inflammation went down so much and my chiropractor told me he doesn’t expect it to come back and said the Toradol  really helped. I’m just so happy with this medication that I had to leave a review. I definitely recommend it!	10	October 15, 2019	10
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Postoperative Pain	I was given IV Toradol in hospital. After 2 days of this drug I developed a severe gastric bleed. Do not take this drug.	1	October 14, 2019	11
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Pain	Cuttently taking toradol oral medication 10mg  for lower back pain, it makes me sleepy and physically relaxed but does absolutely nothing to help the actual pain. I can say that the toradol injection almost immediately stopped the pain completely for about 6 hours.	3	September 30, 2019	2
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Postoperative Pain	I was given Toradol following an appendectomy (via my IV) & was impressed with how well it worked. It did make me sleepy, but it also helped my stress-induced migraine! Will have to discuss this option with my neurologist.	9	September 21, 2019	11
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	I was prescribed this for chronic intractable migraine.  I’ve tried triptans, Botox, Aimovig, and nerve blocks.  Sprix will relieve my pain within one hour—I’ve gone  from not working and being laid up, to working 30-hrs per week.  It’s been life-changing.    You do have to follow the directions closely or you will have extreme burning in your nose and throat.  Once you get the hang of it using is much easier.  	9	September 20, 2019	10
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I got an Toradol injection in my hip to help with migraine pain, and I felt so tired all day afterwards. My stomach hurts, and my entire lower back is tensed up and cramping from the injection. I was worried about this, but I saw others posting about it. My migraine is gone but the side effects are uncomfortable. I could have dealt with the migraine pain instead of the side effects from the shot. I was too exhausted to function and get any work done all day.	8	September 18, 2019	2
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	This medication cannot be compared to any opioid or acetaminophen, because neither of those things reduce inflammation. This medication works against swelling and inflammation, which is why it works better for treating stuff like that. It can be used along with an opioid as well, if needed!! Depends on what you're treating. I see a lot of comments saying that this medication works better than opioids, there's a reason for that though!	10	September 14, 2019	7
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	"I suffer from upper back pain that occasionally flares up pretty bad that sends shooting pain into my left shoulder blade and this time up into my head. I had pain in the back on my head for about 3 weeks, then it moved to my left temple where it throbbed so bad, I finally went to the ER, they gave a muscle injection of Torodal and a Norflex (muscle relaxer) injection. The pain went from a 9 to a 1 within 15 minutes. Wish I would've went in sooner. I'm glad I figured out that this drug is an option. Normally ibuprofen works for me but sometimes it doesn't at all, the nurse said this is a ""souped up version"" of ibuprofen."	10	September 13, 2019	5
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	They gave me this Toradol shot and man this shot hurt me. I couldn't move my arm for an hour!!! And really didn't feel a significant relief I swear the shot was not worth my time !!!	1	September 12, 2019	15
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	The ER Dr gave me Toradol for L1 fracture pain. I hadn't slept in 48 hrs. It was useless.	1	September 9, 2019	11
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Pain	I have received this medication twice in my life now and both times it worked great to help relieve the pain from kidney stones. The anti inflammatory effects help a lot too to make the stone pass easier and a little faster. They gave me that and Dilaudid together. The pain was worse the second time I had my kidney stones, so it didn’t completely go away, but I went from like an 8 or 9 down to about a 3.	8	September 9, 2019	2
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	I suffer from severe chronic migraines that come with a variety of symptoms outside of pain. They're new to me, and so far I've found that I only have a very small window to take an oral abortive medication before they become ineffective and I'm left to wait out the migraine which becomes hard being a music student and always surrounded by sound and light. Being in college, I can't always get to my neurologist's office for injections either, which is when I was prescribed Sprix. After a week-long migraine, Sprix managed to cut my pain from a 7-8 range down to a 2-3 in only about ten minutes. It's difficult to administer at first, you have to angle the bottle right and hold your breath and make sure not to inhale it after for the next few minutes, but the discomfort is will worth the pain relief and so far minimal side effects. The second dose was easier than the first, and so far has helped just as much, and so far my other symptoms have been relieved along with the pain!	10	September 7, 2019	12

Acunivive 60 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	On 8/11/19 I was in a car accident. I was diagnosed with, Cervical Spine Sprain and Strain. Thoracic Spine Sprain, as well as a left hip strain. I’ve been to the ER twice. Along with the dr through my work as this accident happened while I was working. My second time in the ER was last night. They gave me IV Toradol, along with IV Valum. (I’m a cancer survivor so I’m also on Dilaudid and Gabapentin at home. I couldn’t get my pain under control with these medications.) I waited for my MRI and was in pain awful. Once this medication kicked in I was shocked at how well it worked!!! MRI  revealed that everything else is okay. However the dr said my muscles and tendons etc were so tight!!! This medication helped so much that it’s now the next day and thankful my muscle spams have not come back! I’d ask for this medication anyway before pain meds for my back pain!	10	August 23, 2019	9
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I have chronic pain every day with back problems and suffer migraines as well.

Acunivive 60 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	I have severe endometriosis pain and didn’t want to be on birth control. I also tried Orillisa and with that I traded one pain for another with extreme migraines. I had basically given up at that point until my doc told me to try Sprix. I was still skeptical but I said what do I have to loose so on my second day of extreme endo pain I tried it and when I tell u my pain was 95% gone ! I couldn’t believe it I'm still in shock this medication is something I cannot live without now I'm so happy	8	August 19, 2019	7
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Toradol IV/IM (ketorolac) for Pain	I just had an IV  with Toradol along with Magnesium at an   infusion center  for very nasty/chronic migraine & posterior cervical pain. As in the  past, I did not get NOT get very much relief. I got off OXYCod. 7.5 mg. because of my tolerance that one gets after longterm use. In pain almost every day ! Had cervical 4-level fusion  on Jan 28. Wish I never did ! Imitrex only helps migraine not the cervical/occipital pain daily. Anyone know how I can get pain relief! Tried many 'scripts over last 10+ yrs.  	3	August 12, 2019	0

Acunivive 60 Injection System	Toradol IV/IM (ketorolac) for Pain	I have severe migraines. Despite neurology shots in my head, neck and shoulders I still get migraines. I usually have sumatriptan pills to help at the start of one. But when caffeine and these don’t work, I take a ketoralac/tramadol shot IM at home. These help avoid ER visits and hospitalization. It takes about 15 minutes for it to really kick in, but the effect is almost immediate...as if the migraine never happened. When I did go to the ER, tramadol IV instantly removed any pain in my eyes, head and neck. I’ve had no side effects other than about 30 minutes of tenderness where I received the shot (upper arm).   This works for some and not others. Mine is only as needed for severe pain.	9	July 31, 2019	2
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I went to a carnival with my family and hurt my back on one of the rides. I found out later they weren't even supposed to let people on that part of the ride due to the possibility of injury. So I went to an urgent care clinic as soon as they were open cause my pain hadn't got any better. They gave me Toradol it hurt at the injection site and made my back pain about 2x worse than it already  was.  It took over an hour to kick in and only gave me relief for about 15 min I then had to wait 2 hrs at a hospital with orders for xrays in severe pain all because I live an hour away from the hospital. My husband called and complained about it and we found out that because we went in with orders we should have been seen right away. I'm stuck with a useless hospital system that taking over every clinic and service possible in my area.. And since we live in an area with a lot of addicts and pill seekers its impossible to get help when its really needed	1	July 23, 2019	19
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	I suffer from severe chronic daily (every single day!) migraines as well as Trigeminal Neuralgia types 1 & 2. Trigeminal Neuralgia is considered to be the worst possible pain a human can experience, is nicknamed “the suicide disease”, and is extremely difficult to manage. I am beyond grateful for this medication! It helps manage both conditions incredibly well. Someone here complained that it was like pouring acid up your nose and down your throat. They aren’t using it properly. It takes a while to get the hang of it (you have to to you head forward and DO NOT inhale!). The only negative is it can only be used sparingly, as an “emergency” medication for your worst days, because the most you can get is 5 vials per month. But I would be in an awful place without this. It makes me stop screaming out (truly) in Trigeminal pain. I dulls my worst migraines. You just learn to choose your battles. It is strong, effective medication for severe and exquisite pain. I highly recommend it.	10	July 23, 2019	18

Acunivive 60 Injection System	Pain	I had severe back pain for over a year and this took it away completely when I got it. It has been a miracle for me. I would like to know if anyone takes this regularly? Twice a day? Is it dangerous to do this as this is what I’ve done for over a month and have had no side effects.	10	May 25, 2019	1
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	I don't know how it works for pain,  haven't given it enough time to tell.  But you may as well spray acid into your nose/sinuses/throat.... won't use twice.	5	May 15, 2019	5
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I was given IV Toradol for severe pain while in the ER after a bad neck injury .  The injection hurt my vein so bad I thought I was going to pass out.  Took all of my neck pain away for about 30 seconds, then I was back up to an 8.  I was really hoping it would work.	2	May 12, 2019	12
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	I was given this by my neurologist for migraines. I’m also an epileptic so  taking any new meds can cause my seizures to be worse. So it’s been sitting in my fridge for 3 weeks. 4 days ago I had a really bad seizure and with it came the horrible migraine. I took my first dose of Sprix and I felt like I had just spayed pepper spray up my nose! Omg!! It was like an instant panic attack from pain! Once the pain in my nose was gone (about 15 min) I noticed my migraine was almost completely gone. I had to talk myself into taking my second dose. But once I made it past the burn my migraine was completely gone, so yes the Sprix works great on migraines, it was amazing!! My issue is how healthy is this if it comes with that much pain.....?	7	May 10, 2019	11
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I was in the hospital for meningitis and all they would give me for pain was  this rubbish Toradol and Tylenol ! Really?

Acunivive 60 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	So my first dose was a quite uncomfortable burning sensation. Second dose was less burning 3rd and 4th dose for the day barely any burning at all. This has taken my pain from an 8-10 down to a 1-2 on the pain scale. I've used this medicine to treat my chronic low back pain myofascial pain syndrome chronic sciatica. The doctor has given me this to get me through until I can get to pain management. I'm already seeing fantastic results I might just continue what this medication.	10	May 2, 2019	14
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	I hate taking this. I mean hate taking it. It burns your nose, it usually makes me feel sick for a couple of days. But it helps so much with pain, even instantly. I would rather deal with a burning nose and sore throat than my fibromyalgia pain so I am grateful for this medication.	10	April 16, 2019	14

Acunivive 60 Injection System	Toradol IV/IM (ketorolac) for Pain	Toradol makes me feel pretty strange and out of it for a few days. It works for post-procedure pain, but I honestly don't know if it's any more effective than just taking ibuprofen. Regardless, I'd rather deal with a headache after my procedure than feel weird and in pain for a few days.	5	March 16, 2019	1
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I pulled the stent from my ureter after having a stone removed and within minutes I was in severe pain. After 2 hours of worsening pain I drove to the urologists office and begged to help relieve the enormous treachery I was enduring. They gave me a shot to my hip and within minutes the pain level dropped from 9 to a 5. The relief was a Godsend. The anti-inflammatory in the drug opened the ureter and allowed blood clots and other debris to filter into the bladder. I was then prescribed toradol in pill form. This got me through the horrific ordeal I had experienced. 	10	February 16, 2019	12
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	I was skeptical and apprehensive about using this medicine after my hip replacement surgery, so for the first 13 days I avoided it. I take piroxicam for my cervical spondylosis and as the days went on the pain in my neck became unbearable, yet my hip pain was minimal. I wasn't able to take the piroxicam with the aspirin I was taking as a blood thinner. This resulted in extreme neck pain and migraine headaches that were debilitating.  I gave in and took the Sprix for the first time when on day 14 I just couldn't function. The pain in my neck and head was intolerable so I had to do something. I took it and within 20 minutes or less the pain had moderated to a level I could stand. Within an hour it was almost completely gone.  I am now a believer. Glad I tried it!	10	February 11, 2019	17
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	This medicine has helped me tremendously with migraines and fibromyalgia. I am unable to take Maxalt or similar drugs due to a reaction so this has been an absolute lifesaver for me!	10	February 4, 2019	9
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I was given a toradol shot for severe sciatica pain.  Might as well have given me an injection of water--NO pain relief whatsoever.	1	February 4, 2019	20
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Toradol IV/IM (ketorolac) for Pain	I had my first kidney stone (I didn't know a human could feel such pain, writhing on the floor, etc.). I got an IV dose of Toradol in the ambulance, and a Toradol pill in the ER. Neither had any effect on the pain. About two hours later, the stone passed on its own, and the pain vanished.	1	January 28, 2019	1
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Toradol IV/IM (ketorolac) for Pain	"Let me see. Toradol? It's a joke. 56 surgeries, body parts that are not mine, shot, stabbed and blown up. 30 years USMC, oh, and I am now told I have CRPS. McGill Pain Scale  is a 1, a ONE for CRPS. Due to all of the surgeries from trauma I have received far too much morphine. Can't tolerate any med but IM demerol for pain. Why this rubbish is even on the market amazes me. Perhaps it is to make the morons we, well some of us, call ""doctor"" feel even more important. Toradol is a waste of $$$ and time."	1	January 24, 2019	0
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Postoperative Pain	I had knee replacement surgery and was given a Hydrocodone combination along with a Ketorolac prescription after leaving the hospital. It worked better on my pain than the opioids prescribed. I did not have any side effects. Wonderful drug.	10	January 11, 2019	2
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	I have to agree with a few others I also wish this could be used for more days than five.  I have fibromyalgia and polio, sprix works great for me I have not experienced burning in my nose or throat as of yet.  I do hope they read the reviews so they can see this medication has helped a lot of us! For me I'm glad I gave this a try 	10	January 9, 2019	12
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I suffer from Chronic kidney stones.  The first time I was given Tordol interveniously and it literally worked within a minute!! I was in so much pain and vomiting from the pain. After the Tordol it relieved the kidney pain immediately.  Now when I’m rushed to hospital or walk in clinic, it’s the first thing I ask for! I’ve never had it as a shot in my muscle, so I can’t give my opinion, but through an IV was awesome. I have had no side effects from it either!		January 7, 2019	8
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Toradol IM (ketorolac) for Pain	I had fallen the day before and ended up the next day with back spasms. These aren't just little twinges, they are like someone is sticking a knife in my back. They are the worst!! I sent in to the doctor's office and they gave me a shot of Toradol. I got absolutely no relief at all. Might as well have been a placebo. I didn't have any side effects from it, which is unusual for me.  My spasms lasted for 12 hours straight before stopping.	1	January 3, 2019	2
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	I have not found that Sprix is very helpful for me. I felt no change in my pain relief. The burning that some have mentioned was not that bad to me. Don't sniff it in. That's not how you are supposed to take it. Make sure to watch the video and it shows exactly how to do it!	3	December 18, 2018	6
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	I'm 38 and have had occasional headaches most of my life.  This is the 1st drug that has been this effective.	10	December 11, 2018	6
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I have chronic kidney stones and they always want to give me toradol IM for the pain. First off, the standards for what constitutes a properly sized muscle need to be reviewed, because 1/3 of the time, they'll give it to me in the deltoid, while the rest of the time, they insist on the gluteus medius. Regardless of where they put it, it doesn't help much with the problem at hand. If I happen to have a headache or sore back at the time, the toradol clears it right up. The severe pain it's meant to treat, on the other hand, barely has the edge taken off. The worst thing is that it causes intense soreness and cramping in the injection site for hours, far worse than a tetanus shot. Some people have good experiences, so it's worth a try to dodge opioids, but don't be afraid to tell them it doesn't work.	3	November 29, 2018	8
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I have MS and pinched nerve in my C spine . When I have a flare up or bad spasticity this drug works great ! Go in , get a shot and literally 1 minute later the pain is relieved .	10	November 29, 2018	3
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	I’ve suffered with migraines for over 10 years. I’ve taken everything and done all kinds of treatment. Including Botox. This nasal spray works within 10 mins. It does burn your nose pretty bad and leaves a horrible taste in your throat. But ..... it’s amazing. My only complaint is once you’ve opened a small bottle you have to dispose in 24hrs. I’ve tried to keep them longer and the medicine just doesn’t work after that time period. I would highly recommend this to anyone with chronic migraines. It had been a life saver	10	November 28, 2018	10
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	They gave me this drug for a pulled muscle in my back, it helped with the pain, but the side effects were not worth it, terrible stomach pain, burning in my stomach, belching, bloating, 3 days since the injection, and my stomach is still not back to normal, I will never take this drug again	1	November 9, 2018	8
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Toradol IM (ketorolac) for Pain	Went to my Primary Care with extreme, crippling menstrual pain (I have cysts and endometriosis). Nurse injected in my arm, I am routinely used to injections and I've never felt such pain from a needle in my life.  My entire arm went numb, I couldn't feel my hand. Then, for a long while afterwards I kept getting shockwaves up and down my arm, like bees stinging inside of my nerves. Not sure if this was the drug or malpractice? Minutes later I was vomiting profusely in the office wastebasket. My arm then developed a large, red circular rash. Apparently this is not a normal reaction. Once I was home, I also got a hideous migraine as a side effect. The drug did relieve my cramps, and knocked me out for a good several hours, but it wasn't worth the headache or the pain in my arm. Never again.	1	October 25, 2018	1
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I had a heart attack in March 2018. In the hospital, they were giving me Morphine for pain. I hated the way it made me feel and it did nothing for the pain. After a day of Morphine I asked that I be given something else, thus my introduction to Toradol. I wish I'd known about Toradol before being given Morphine. It made me feel so much better, without the horrible side effects of Morphine.	10	October 24, 2018	9
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Postoperative Pain	This was given to me after multiple surgeries stemming from a botched gallbladder removal. This drug gave me horrible hallucinations and extremely vivid dreams. It scared me to death out and made me sweat profusely. I don’t ever want anything to do with this drug again.	1	October 3, 2018	6
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Toradol IM (ketorolac) for Pain	Received IM injection. No relief of pain. Caused pain, paresthesia, hyperesthesia and numbness from hip injection site to lateral knee. This persists 6 weeks later. Experienced nausea and violent vomiting for 12 hours as well. I will not take this again	1	September 28, 2018	2
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I get a toradol shot when I get a migraine that lasts longer than a day and when naproxen hasn't help. I have had them help and sometimes they do not.   Got one today and the pain was gone within an hour. Plus the nurse did a great job, no burning sensation after injection. I have been lucky lately, not having a bad burning sensation. I once had a nurse inject it quickly and had the worst burning sensation from it. I think when it is injected slower it's better.   Overall the toradol shot is good for me. I also take hydroxyzine (anti anxiety, antihistamine) at onset of migraine too.  The NASID and antihistamine work very well for me.	9	September 28, 2018	9
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	They always try to give me this when I have a migraine. It has never worked for my pain. They still make me try it before they will even consider giving me anything else. It is no better than 800mg of Advil or Cambia. And I can take that stuff at home without having to pay a copay! So frustrating that this is the first line of defence for a migraine that won’t go away.	2	September 18, 2018	8
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Toradol IV/IM (ketorolac) for Pain	I suffer from severe nerve and back pain. When my gabapentin and norcos can't cut it I go to the ER and get a shot of toradol. I will have electric shooting pains that go down my leg and out my foot every few minutes. 60 mg of Toradol will have me pain-free within an hour. I have gone several times so far. One flare-up was so bad that the shot only stopped it for 24 hrs and I had to go back the next day and get another. Then I was good for a few months till the next bad flare up	10	September 6, 2018	4
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	Toradol right into my sciatic nerve worked for 18 months. Tonight they want to put toradol in my shoulder.  Seems dumb to put toradol into my bloodstream and not where the pain is.		September 6, 2018	4
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	Used this post hip labrum and FAI arthroscopic surgery. Works incredibly well. Never needed to supplement the narcotic pain pills they prescribed. Took Sprix with Tylenol and with ice every hour I was virtually pain free.	10	September 2, 2018	6
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	I had a Superior Hypogastric Plexus Block aka a giant needle guided by x-ray though muscles and spine to numb some nerves for my chronic endometriosis pain. I was given SPRIX to help in my recovery from the injection and it did nothing but make me nauseous. If it helped with the pain I couldn't tell. I think Percocet would do better than this NSAID-SPRIX.  Note: I've got a tolerance for strong meds so it takes a lot of anything to help me when I have severe pain. I think it might help others but isn't strong enough for me.  My dosage was 15.75mg spray in each nose every 6-8 hours. The burn hurts bad, makes me cry and sometimes makes me sneeze. After 1 day of usage with no relief I'm calling my Dr for something else.  FYI: On the other hand this block I get does help my endometriosis pain after the recovery from the injection itself. If you happen to have chronic endo. pain I can recommend this shot.	1	September 1, 2018	3
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	I’ve had Kidney stones for 25 years. I’m now 42. Having a stone 2-5 times a year really sucks. Only a couple years ago my doctor RX’d me Sprix. Yes, it kind of burns the nose a little and drips down your throat and taste horrible . Chase it with some water. It absolutely takes to pain away in a matter of 5-15 minutes tops. So much better than Dilaudid 4mg. Wish I had this years ago. So much easier than having narcotics.	10	August 28, 2018	7
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I got a injection of Toradol when I was admitted the night before I gotten my gallbladder out. I was in so much pain and Dilaudid only helped me for a hour at the most. My nurse finally gave me a shot of Toradol and I could finally sleep. Having a gallstones attack was the worst pain I have ever felt in my life. It lasted until I woke up after surgery and was in my room. I am so grateful that it helped!	10	August 25, 2018	4
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Toradol IM (ketorolac) for Pain	I was in #9+ pain after a cervical (SPINE) nerve cauterizing procedure, (in addition to migraine) & was highly distressed  to get ZERO pain relief.  The drive/additional nausea/pain/stress to get the Toradol shot caused WORSE pain than if I'd known Toradol was the only remedy offered. Toradol is not effective for me at all!	1	August 23, 2018	2
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	I absolutely wish there was a formulation I could take for more than 5 days. If I could take this every day, I could probably go off of my narcotic pain meds. I will agree with many, the taste and burning can be hard but it’s definitely worth it. At least for me.	10	August 19, 2018	8
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	"As most have stated this burns terribly, however I DO NOT CARE! I would take worse pain if its something that will elevate my migraines. I am on a whole host of meds, and I hate medication. I prefer natural means, however nothing worked so here I am. I will do anything to rid myself of these migraines. I have had nerve blocks and a few times gone to the ER for a ""migraine cocktail"" this medication has replaced that need. When living with a violent migraine for 21 days, I would try anything! Having this on hand eliminates that possibility. This DOES WORK! Just push through the initial nose burn and move on. As stated I do not like medication, I have resigned myself to that not being the case, but I do push my limits. I only use this as a last resort and only after a few days of trying everything else.  I hope my rant encourages you to stick through the nose pain. If you do....a clear and quiet mind with NO PAIN, PUKING, LOSS OF VISION, it legit gives you your life back with in a few mins."	8	August 15, 2018	9
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I got a shot of toradol after I went to ER for nerve pain. As soon as she stabbed it in my arm I felt pain. My hand is cramping and have tingling all over my body.	1	August 4, 2018	5
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I had daily headaches resulting from a concussion. A neurologist put me on Toradol and I could not wait to wean myself off. I had such stabbing pain in both eyes from it I could barely function. I now take Elavil and am very excited not to have headaches! Fingers crossed!		July 26, 2018	6
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	Toradol worked right away on back pain.  The shot hurt a bit,  but now, the next morning, I can't go to work as I have got  diarrhea, chills and fever, heartburn. Just like the side effect list.	9	July 25, 2018	4
Acunivive 60 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	Sprix burns my nose HORRIBLY! Even if I don’t inhale it later after I sniff just a little it burns every sinus cavity and makes my eyes water and burn. Then when I finally lay back down it burns my throat for about 30 minutes. It feels like I’m shoving jalapeños up my nose and in my sinus cavities. As for the pain it doesn’t help there either. Maybe this medicine is just not for me.	1	July 8, 2018	1
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	Went into the ER on Friday April 23 for chest and left arm pain, was given a Toradol injection in my left arm, burned like anything, kind of like 3 bees stung me. It eased the pain for a little, from about a 10 to a 7 in pain level , it is now Sunday and I still feel the stinging sensation in my arm and the pain has gone down all the way to my left rib cage,  now, my chest is just fine, but now I have this damn pain from the injection. I have been placing a cold ice pack and it helps a little , at night pain gets worse where I had the injection.  I honestly don't recommend Toradol it hurts like anything.	1	April 26, 2021	0
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	Woke up with severe stomach, flank, and left sided back pain. About 5 days of horrific pain scheduled doctor's visit. He then sent me to the ER. Was kept in the ER for over 8 hours. Given IV meds that got rid of pain for a short period of time, but made me itch horribly. Went back to my PCP and was told I had diverticulitis and possibly triggered my degenerate disc disease  Given antibiotics and an injection of toradol.  Heavens above my pain is gone. Prescription toradol every 6 hours PRN. I am so grateful. This has got to be a wonder drug. Hope I can heal and pain stays at bay	10	April 25, 2021	0
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I went into the ER because of a seven day long migraine. They gave me a shot of Toradol. Within one hour my entire abdomen was painfully heaving and cramping about every 1 to 2 minutes. For the first five days I couldn’t eat, and I couldn’t sit down, because sitting made it worse. So I paced my house until I was so exhausted that I could nap. Then I would wake up in the middle of the night and continue to pace until I was so exhausted I could go back to sleep again.   That severe heaving and cramping continued for five straight weeks. It took three different medication‘s to get it to stop.  It was the most torturous time of my entire life. I could barely sleep, and I couldn’t work.  Now, I can’t even take Advil. It causes the same response. (Before the Toradol I took Advil all the time with positive results.)	1	April 21, 2021	0
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Toradol IM (ketorolac) for Pain	I have arachnoiditis, which is inflammation of the arachnoid layer of the covering of the spinal cord. I have 24/7 intractable pain for which I am on injectable dilaudid. When my pain flares even the dilaudid doesn’t work. Enter Toredol which saves my life. I inject 30 mg at home every other day when I’m flaring. Can’t take more than that because it is bad for your GI tract if you take too long. It is a God send.	10	March 24, 2021	0
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	Went to the ER for awful lower abdominal pain. Was given Toradol intravenously and my pain did not go away. I felt no different in terms of pain. I did get a little sleep but that is it. ☹️	1	March 14, 2021	0
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	If you have Eosinophilic esophagitis (EOE)....DO NOT TAKE OR ACCEPT THIS DRUG!!!! I went into the ER for arm & chest pain. (No heart attack...I believe it was my EOE causing spasming) The dr didn’t bat an eye when I told him I have EOE. I got the injection form & right off the bat started having issues with it. It also did diddly squat for the pain that I went in for.  I told the dr I wasn’t feeling right (sick to my stomach & dizzy at the time). He took my oxygen level & then gave me my discharge papers. That night, stomach pain. The next day, stomach pain & my body felt super fidgety on the inside. The next day, back in the ER because my stomach pain was getting worse along with my tremors. 5 days later, I’m still having tremors. My stomach is still hurting.  Going off the side effect list, I’ve had quite a few of the reactions listed. This is definitely a no go for me ever again!!!!! I went in the ER for one issue & came out with another.	1	March 12, 2021	0
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Pain	This medicine is so amazing the way it blocks the pain receptors. Incredible job creating this! This medication is a God send!	10	February 21, 2021	0
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	Went to Urgent Care for back pain. The Toradol did not work. The pain did not lessen at all. What a waste of money	1	February 18, 2021	2
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	OMG this is THE BEST pain reliever I’ve had. It even worked better than the IV fentanyl that was ordered following a shoulder surgery. If I could take it every day, I would, but it’s dangerous, and the restrictions are for patient safety. But if it’s an option for pain relief, I’ll take it over a narcotic any day.	10	February 15, 2021	6
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I have Ehlers Danlos Syndrome (EDS) but currently have an infected tooth. (Tooth pain is the worst pain possible imo) Pain so bad, beats per minute was 168. Went to ER, Dr rx Toradol. Never had it as am allergic to NSAIDS. (not even sure if its ok for me?) A few minutes after it was administrated via IV, I started having a severe headache along with pain down my neck. It did absolutely nothing to lower the excruciating tooth pain either. I'm on long term pain meds for my EDS (10+ years) I assumed my meds weren't working due to the bad infection. Was sent home from ER in worse pain. Later began having constant severe upper stomach pain after I got home. The horrible effects lasted hours. Finally took one of my normal pain meds in the evening, and it alleviated the headache & stomach pain, plus also somehow still worked 1000 times better for my tooth than Toradol. Doctors can do better but they are scared.	1	February 8, 2021	1
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Postoperative Pain	I was prescribed oral keterolac 10 mg for my impacted wisdom tooth removal. I get about an hour of relief, and then the pain is unimaginable. Useless.	1	January 19, 2021	10
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I’ve had toradol in an IV twice in the last year at two different ER’s. May as well have handed me one aleve. So, now I have to sit with this excruciating pain for the foreseeable future. Toradol does not work. At all. But does make doctors very proud of themselves for not prescribing an opiate, which would be the thing that would actually help. I hurt all over. This pain is worse the childbirth but hey, who cares, right?	1	January 5, 2021	13
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I had an IV vitamin infusion about an hour after a root canal. She added Toradol to the IV. For the first day and a half, I had absolutely ZERO pain from the procedure. I could hardly even tell where I had several injections in my mouth. After a day and a half, I started noticing little aches and pains in my mouth from the injections and holding my mouth open for so long. This shows me that the Toradol worked amazingly well until it was all out of my system. I’ll have this done EVERY time I have painful dental work from now on!	10	January 1, 2021	3
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Pain	This drug is a joke ketorolac 10 milligram mg oral tablets. The only way I feel them is if I'm lucky enough to have a narcotic with them because it is an NSAID and does help reduce inflammation that being said it doesn't touch my broken fingers pain. Per Hospital requirement no pain meds unless broken.. I was hoping it would not be broken since it was I was prescribed ketorolac and morphine immediate-release and I feel great this happened Christmas Eve so I'm only 2 Days In. But when I use the ketorolac during the day without the morphine immediate-release there is no effect so I have to tough it out because they only give you a couple days worth of pain meds and you're done and I'm not looking to get hooked anyways so unfortunately ketorolac is what they're giving you for inflammation. I got to go see a hand specialist I have no insurance that makes it very expensive and hard to do especially during a pandemic	3	December 26, 2020	1
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Pain	Have an arthritic thumb. Doc prescribed Ketorolac. Twice a day for 10 days, 10 mg. After three days, I woke up with a loud ringing in my ears. Found out that it’s a side affect. Now have trouble sleeping because my ears are ringing so loud and my thumb is still painful. Wish I never took this nasty drug.	1	December 24, 2020	1
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	When I used Sprix to treat my migraines, I was quite shocked over the severe burning pain it caused in my nose. The burning was far worse than the migraine and I could not keep using this without lidocaine nasal gel or spray.   At the time I bought Sprix, I did not have any drug coverage from my health insurance. Shockingly, a 1 month prescription cost me over $500.00 U.S. dollars!! When I asked to be switched to generic oral Toral (Ketorolac) tablets, the same month's supply and dosage cost me about $20.00 U.S. dollars. Oral ketorolac worked equally effectively to the Sprix nasal spray in terms of analgesia, drug onset time, and duration. I have gastroparesis (stomach paralysis), which can delay oral meds from reaching my intestine, but found that the 20-40 minute onset helped.  My bottom line is to avoid Sprix nasal spray as it is grossly overpriced and it causes such severe burning pain in the nose that Sprix scares away the migraine.	7	November 4, 2020	4
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	As a 5'0, 87lbs woman age 21 who suffers from Endometriosis pains, muscle soreness and runners' knee, I decided the burning bloody nose was worth the trouble. I have yet to see a significant change in mobility but again it's worth it if your insurance covers it. When is the average time to feel the real effects of the drug and is anyone else sneezing it out?	7	October 30, 2020	1
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Postoperative Pain	Post-op major orthopedic surgery, Toradol was great pain management, moderate nausea, mild tinnitus, mild headache and decreased urination. I can function better than when I’ve taken opioids. Sedation is transient about 90 minutes after dose. 10/10	10	October 12, 2020	4
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Toradol IV/IM (ketorolac) for Pain	I had a severe toothache and got Toradol IV/IM in the ER. I honestly didn't think it would work but it did. Thankful for this medicine!!!	10	October 11, 2020	1
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Pain	Prescribed for dental pain that is a 9/10 and this brought it down to a 8/10 for an hour. Honestly the Advil worked better. No relief.	1	October 3, 2020	1
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	"I find Sprix to be helpful for migraine and neck pain. Make sure to read the instructions carefully. Should be sprayed TO THE SIDE of inside the nostril, and not inhaled; breathe through mouth a few minutes, and this reduces the burning. Can use same bottle up to 24 hours; don't put in fridge after using.  Can apply every 6 to 8 hours. My doc didn't say whether to do one or both nostrils, so I tried one the first time and it helped. The second migraine episode, headache was worse, so I  tried both nostrils, and it helped. I'm a woman, age 58, height 5'5"" and weigh 145 lbs."	9	September 25, 2020	8
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Pain	Prescribed ketorolac 10mg by dentist for the time before my tooth could be pulled. Taking it has no effect. Not even the smallest dent in the pain.	1	September 14, 2020	2
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	Toradol was prescribed at an urgent care center.  I’m 70 years old.  The medication relieved pain in my jaw due to a tooth issue.  During the past 5 months I’ve had 3 root canals and a bone graft for the problem.  Toradol worked quickly and allowed me to sleep.  Very helpful!  I received it by injection.	10	August 30, 2020	3
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Pain	I bailed on my skateboard a week or so ago and cracked a couple ribs. The doctor prescribed this to me @10mg 4x daily as needed.  It has done nothing  for the pain. I take it and still feel just as much pain as not taking it.	1	August 30, 2020	2
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	Thank goodness for Toradol! This is what I ask for when I have a chronic migraine. I am writing this now after a trip to urgent care. It does not take the pain away completely but makes it manageable. Just wanted to share because the pain can be agonizing and I hate for anyone to suffer.	10	August 23, 2020	12
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Pain	This drug ketorolac IS HORRIBLE!!! I had surgery last week and they started with an IV then pills when I went home. Nothing helped when I took them, this medicine made me hurt in my stomach worse and I have severe swelling and cramping, sweating, omg I will wake up wet...this medicine is AWFUL...I shouldn't just took 600 mg of Ibuprofen.	1	August 12, 2020	5
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	When you use the nasal spray you have to point the tip to the side of your nose not up still burns for a few seconds but really helped my pain . Reduced it by 50 percent		July 24, 2020	0
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Toradol IV/IM (ketorolac) for Pain	Had a kidney stone last night. In severe pain I went to a local ER. They gave me Toradol IV with absolutely zero pain relief. Later on Morphine did the trick.	1	May 11, 2020	2
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I have a severe case of mono and my tonsils swelled up to the point of not being able to swallow, talk and could barely breathe. was in 9/10 pain and swallowing felt like swallowing knives which is very unbearable. I was given steroids and toradol shot to reduce swelling and for pain. The injection itself was very uncomfortable but within 15 mins I was able to move and open my mouth and it took away my my pain to where I was finally able to swallow solid foods!! I'd say it lasted about 6 hours. It did make me a little drowsy which was nice bc U hadn’t been able to sleep. My arm is still very sore from the injection but was so worth it!!	10	March 16, 2020	5
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I’m a recovering addict (8 years clean) So I can’t risk taking opioids. Thought that I tore ligaments behind my knee, was in constant pain for 3 days before finally I couldn’t take it and went to the VA hospital ER.  Turned out I had a massive blood clot and was immediately given a shot of Toradol in my ass cheek for the pain. About 20 minutes later in the blink of an eye my pain vanished.  Just gone, for about 12 hours.  Something morphine and oxy failed to do after earning 2 Purple Hearts.	10	March 9, 2020	28
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I fractured my L1 vertebrae and got a Toradol injection at the urgent care - the doctor then gave me a three day supply of pills of Toradol 10 mg three times a day - it really did nothing to relieve my pain. I’m going to the orthopedic spine doctor tomorrow and hopefully he can prescribe something that will relieve the pain until the fracture heals	1	March 8, 2020	8
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	Awful nasal pain and caused a horrible headache. Nose burned so bad that my eyes watered and nose wouldn’t stop running. Will never use again. Prefer the toradol injection much more over this! Didn’t even touch my joint pain.	1	February 22, 2020	3
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	No pain relief with Toradol  at all for sciatica back, hip, groin and leg pain. Absolutely NONE,	1	February 21, 2020	20
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Pain	I have frequent and relatively small (5mm) oxalate kidney stones. Despite their small size they produce incredible pain and cramping as they travel down the Ureter. The IV Toradol (ketorolac) that they give me in the ER has never failed to completely eliminate the pain for up to 12 hours. If they could prescribe it in the IV form for home use I would gladly use it until the stone passes.  I've also received Toradol (ketorolac) for an episode of Pleurisy. The results were the same. It completely eliminated the pain.	10	February 14, 2020	3
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	Went to pick up a large garbage bag full of glass bottles. The bag was probably around 50-60 lbs and I carried it with one hand while I maneuvered around my house with it. Walk to my car and up my stairs and boom!! Back gave out. Worst pain I have felt since fracturing my hand. Did the traditional icing, laying down and taking some leftover opioids so that I can walk to bathroom and kitchen. 3 days no change, back still slanted from the hip to the chest so I decided to go to urgent care. They gave me the shot of toradol and my pain when from 10 while standing/walking to a 3. Combined that with muscle relaxer my pain level is 1 right now because of random nerves shooting. I recommend to get this shot. I’m a 27 year old male	10	February 11, 2020	9
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Pain	I got this medication to help with my jaw and shooting teeth nerve pains as my doctor stopped prescribing T3s for the pain. I'd say my teeth pain level were at a 2/10 when on T3s and now using ketorolac pain is a 9/10. Doesn't do anything for severe nerve teeth pain. Plus I've read about people bleeding on the inside cuz of this drug which is sketchy as anything. I'll stick with my t3s thank you very much.	1	January 24, 2020	3
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	This medicine helps me tremendously with my lower back pain. It is given to me through a shot form. Although it makes me sleepy I would say it takes away my pain about 80%. Highly effective for me.	8	January 22, 2020	10
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	Burns my sinuses and gives me a wicked headache. Didn't even full my pain	1	January 19, 2020	2
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I have had 4 Torodal injections over the course of 10 months, the first 3 were for sciatica and the 4th one was for a ligament tear in my knee. The first 3 did wonders for me with no pain at the injection site and almost instant pain relief. However this last time was awful, the injection site burned so bad for around 2 hours, it took 4 hours to work and then I had terrible back pain for the next two days. It's definitely a hit or miss medication.	5	January 19, 2020	7
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	dr gave me a  toradol  shot  before a (medically necessary) 16w3d dilation and evacuation (D&E) to relieve pain during the procedure.  1- it stung for about 30 minutes, about the pain/intensity of a severe chemical burn.  2- it DID NOT provide any pain relief, I had to reschedule and return for a week later so they could figure out a safe way to sedate me with my previous bad reactions to sedatives.  3- the injection site still hurts, over a week after. It’s tender, sore all the time... I can’t lay on my left side (which is how I have slept for 20 years), It feels like there’s a bit of a lump at the site, and it hurts more when I walk because my muscles move. The pain from the D&E is already gone, and it’s only been 1 day with no pain meds whatsoever, not even a Tylenol or ibuprofen. But over a week after the injection and it still hurts excessively.	1	January 16, 2020	7
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I frequently suffer from Kidney Stones that ultimately pass. Christmas Eve I was hit with the worse back pain ever and my urine output was bright red blood. I was at the E.R within 30 minutes. I went through triage and they immediately gave me a shot of Toradol. Within 10 minutes the pain reduced to a very manageable “2.” A CAT-scan confirmed a 17.8 x 12.2 triangular stone that no way would pass. It was stuck at the urethra junction reducing my flow. No Urologist was available so they gave me another shot and sent me home with a prescription for five days. I reached a Urologist the day after Christmas and was immediately scheduled for surgery. Toradol kept me sane and able to focus for the three days. I dislike Opiates and would never accept Fentanyl or Morphine (which have both been offered in the past.)	8	January 3, 2020	8
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	I was prescribed this for post sub muscular ulnar nerve transposition. I was so annoyed I was prescribed this. I didn't get it till a week out and the first time I used it and it did nothing. Nothing more than stinging in my sinuses. I gave it another shot my back was acting up so I decided to try it. I used it as directed and it did nothing but make my nose run profusely. I started noticing an absolute monstrosity  of sinus headache which has me in agony. This is billed as Toradol for post op pain. It didn't even take away mild arthritis pain, or hardware pain. This is the *new* alternative? It sucks, and it is in the trash for me at least. It was NOT worth all I went through to get it.	1	January 1, 2020	3
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I was given Toradol when I had a severe kidney stone attack. It worked immediately, as well as a morphine injection had worked for an earlier kidney stone. I never go out of town without packing my Toradol. Reading these reviews indicates it doesn't work for everyone, but it was a God-send for me.	10	December 30, 2019	4
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Pain	OK. I was given toradol yesterday to use for a rescue medication when I have migraines. Yesterday was a nightmare as it was my first botox treatment and I took one of my toradol and my afternoon meds which I had to postpone for about a hour due to when I had to be at the neurologist. There is no recorded interaction between the two but I'm taking a pain pill and I'm getting worse? I was functional for a few hours this morning and then it showed back up. Repeat pattern and again my migraines were worse when I woke up! I had to break the no other nsaid rule and take 2 Excedrin to go along with it as I am that desperate. Take it with food? If I'm reaching for my rescue meds, 9 times out of 10 food ain't gonna be possible. Am I missing something that they didn't tell me about this medication?	4	December 25, 2019	0
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Postoperative Pain	ketorolac doesn’t do ANYTHING for dental pain. Advil was better, I’m in horrible pain and this drug is like taking nothing at all.	1	December 5, 2019	20

Acunivive 90 Injection System	Pain	I received a shot into the muscles of my mid back.  Now there is a cord like lump along the injection site and it Is extremely painful.  I’ve had the pain now for 5 days and counting.  I will not get another injection of the medication again.	1	December 1, 2019	1
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	WHY is the pharmacy that dispenses this drug so hard to deal with? Always super long hold times & ignorant people who I can barely understand on the phone.  I don't have the medicine yet because after WEEKS of trying to get through, they told me my insurance needs prior authorization.   So annoyed.		November 20, 2019	1
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I constantly surprise medical staff when I tell them what drug always works.  I start to tell them, wait for the eye roll as they expect me to name some narcotic or opioid.  Nope, Toradol.   Headaches so bad I am literally throwing up, wearing sunglasses into the dr office and walk out smiling and pain free.    Amazing medicine!	10	November 14, 2019	11
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	I was prescribed this medication by my pain management doctor. Unfortunately the doctor didn't tell me how much to use so I called my pharmacist and asked him. He said 1 spray per nostril, which is what I did. No pain relief. I did more research this morning & found that the dosage is weight based. Over 50kg means that I need 2 sprays per nostril. Yes it does burn, but not for very long. I'd read all of the prescribing information that came with the medication so I knew about the nose burn, which will go away after time. I've been dealing with migraine pain, especially after having lidocaine shots over my eyebrows. This knocked down the migraine pain to tolerable. Unfortunately I can't find out how long this drug will stop my pain after I stop using it. I'm guessing that it must last for a while or the dosage would be higher. Unfortunately I started on a Friday night so I'll have to wait until Monday to call the company to get answers for my questions.	3	November 9, 2019	3
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	Today I got a toradol shot in my hip for my arthritis and Now the pain is 10 times worse it’s shooting down my leg and when she gave me the shot almost 10 mins later I passed out and my blood pressure dropped super low then the doctor let me drive home....?!	1	November 9, 2019	4
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Postoperative Pain	I just had 4 wisdom teeth removed along with an impacted second molar and was prescribed toradol. I have been amazed to say the least. I was expecting to be in horrible pain. I have about 8 stitches and all I have is sore gums, but that's to be expected. Going on day 2 and haven't had any problems.  I have been prescribed several narcotic pain meds that worked for a short period of time and had to take more. Toradol is a miracle drug and I would definitely recommend it over narcotic pain meds. I haven't had any bad side effects. Idk if people having hallucinations were taking something else with or prior to toradol or just adverse side effects.	10	November 5, 2019	7
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Pain	This drug acted no better than a sugar pill for my sciatica.	1	October 15, 2019	5
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I injured my back this weekend and endured the worst pain I’ve ever felt in my life. My lower back muscles cramped up so bad, I had ribs out, sharp pains, etc.. all at once. I went from fine to being in the floor in tears. The pain even got so bad that it made me sick twice. I finally went to the hospital yesterday because I couldn’t handle it anymore. I was in agony. After doing tests, they gave me a Toradol injection. I went from extremely heavy breathing and not even being able to talk or sit up from the pain being so bad to feeling back to normal in less than 10 minutes. It was like day and night. It was seriously a miracle and such a relief. I’m so grateful I was able to get this injection. I’m still recovering from my injury, but the inflammation went down so much and my chiropractor told me he doesn’t expect it to come back and said the Toradol  really helped. I’m just so happy with this medication that I had to leave a review. I definitely recommend it!	10	October 15, 2019	10
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Postoperative Pain	I was given IV Toradol in hospital. After 2 days of this drug I developed a severe gastric bleed. Do not take this drug.	1	October 14, 2019	11
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Pain	Cuttently taking toradol oral medication 10mg  for lower back pain, it makes me sleepy and physically relaxed but does absolutely nothing to help the actual pain. I can say that the toradol injection almost immediately stopped the pain completely for about 6 hours.	3	September 30, 2019	2
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Postoperative Pain	I was given Toradol following an appendectomy (via my IV) & was impressed with how well it worked. It did make me sleepy, but it also helped my stress-induced migraine! Will have to discuss this option with my neurologist.	9	September 21, 2019	11
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	I was prescribed this for chronic intractable migraine.  I’ve tried triptans, Botox, Aimovig, and nerve blocks.  Sprix will relieve my pain within one hour—I’ve gone  from not working and being laid up, to working 30-hrs per week.  It’s been life-changing.    You do have to follow the directions closely or you will have extreme burning in your nose and throat.  Once you get the hang of it using is much easier.  	9	September 20, 2019	10
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I got an Toradol injection in my hip to help with migraine pain, and I felt so tired all day afterwards. My stomach hurts, and my entire lower back is tensed up and cramping from the injection. I was worried about this, but I saw others posting about it. My migraine is gone but the side effects are uncomfortable. I could have dealt with the migraine pain instead of the side effects from the shot. I was too exhausted to function and get any work done all day.	8	September 18, 2019	2
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	This medication cannot be compared to any opioid or acetaminophen, because neither of those things reduce inflammation. This medication works against swelling and inflammation, which is why it works better for treating stuff like that. It can be used along with an opioid as well, if needed!! Depends on what you're treating. I see a lot of comments saying that this medication works better than opioids, there's a reason for that though!	10	September 14, 2019	7
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	"I suffer from upper back pain that occasionally flares up pretty bad that sends shooting pain into my left shoulder blade and this time up into my head. I had pain in the back on my head for about 3 weeks, then it moved to my left temple where it throbbed so bad, I finally went to the ER, they gave a muscle injection of Torodal and a Norflex (muscle relaxer) injection. The pain went from a 9 to a 1 within 15 minutes. Wish I would've went in sooner. I'm glad I figured out that this drug is an option. Normally ibuprofen works for me but sometimes it doesn't at all, the nurse said this is a ""souped up version"" of ibuprofen."	10	September 13, 2019	5
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	They gave me this Toradol shot and man this shot hurt me. I couldn't move my arm for an hour!!! And really didn't feel a significant relief I swear the shot was not worth my time !!!	1	September 12, 2019	15
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	The ER Dr gave me Toradol for L1 fracture pain. I hadn't slept in 48 hrs. It was useless.	1	September 9, 2019	11
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Pain	I have received this medication twice in my life now and both times it worked great to help relieve the pain from kidney stones. The anti inflammatory effects help a lot too to make the stone pass easier and a little faster. They gave me that and Dilaudid together. The pain was worse the second time I had my kidney stones, so it didn’t completely go away, but I went from like an 8 or 9 down to about a 3.	8	September 9, 2019	2
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	I suffer from severe chronic migraines that come with a variety of symptoms outside of pain. They're new to me, and so far I've found that I only have a very small window to take an oral abortive medication before they become ineffective and I'm left to wait out the migraine which becomes hard being a music student and always surrounded by sound and light. Being in college, I can't always get to my neurologist's office for injections either, which is when I was prescribed Sprix. After a week-long migraine, Sprix managed to cut my pain from a 7-8 range down to a 2-3 in only about ten minutes. It's difficult to administer at first, you have to angle the bottle right and hold your breath and make sure not to inhale it after for the next few minutes, but the discomfort is will worth the pain relief and so far minimal side effects. The second dose was easier than the first, and so far has helped just as much, and so far my other symptoms have been relieved along with the pain!	10	September 7, 2019	12

Acunivive 90 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	On 8/11/19 I was in a car accident. I was diagnosed with, Cervical Spine Sprain and Strain. Thoracic Spine Sprain, as well as a left hip strain. I’ve been to the ER twice. Along with the dr through my work as this accident happened while I was working. My second time in the ER was last night. They gave me IV Toradol, along with IV Valum. (I’m a cancer survivor so I’m also on Dilaudid and Gabapentin at home. I couldn’t get my pain under control with these medications.) I waited for my MRI and was in pain awful. Once this medication kicked in I was shocked at how well it worked!!! MRI  revealed that everything else is okay. However the dr said my muscles and tendons etc were so tight!!! This medication helped so much that it’s now the next day and thankful my muscle spams have not come back! I’d ask for this medication anyway before pain meds for my back pain!	10	August 23, 2019	9
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I have chronic pain every day with back problems and suffer migraines as well.

Acunivive 90 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	I have severe endometriosis pain and didn’t want to be on birth control. I also tried Orillisa and with that I traded one pain for another with extreme migraines. I had basically given up at that point until my doc told me to try Sprix. I was still skeptical but I said what do I have to loose so on my second day of extreme endo pain I tried it and when I tell u my pain was 95% gone ! I couldn’t believe it I'm still in shock this medication is something I cannot live without now I'm so happy	8	August 19, 2019	7
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Toradol IV/IM (ketorolac) for Pain	I just had an IV  with Toradol along with Magnesium at an   infusion center  for very nasty/chronic migraine & posterior cervical pain. As in the  past, I did not get NOT get very much relief. I got off OXYCod. 7.5 mg. because of my tolerance that one gets after longterm use. In pain almost every day ! Had cervical 4-level fusion  on Jan 28. Wish I never did ! Imitrex only helps migraine not the cervical/occipital pain daily. Anyone know how I can get pain relief!

Acunivive 90 Injection System	Toradol IV/IM (ketorolac) for Pain	I have severe migraines. Despite neurology shots in my head, neck and shoulders I still get migraines. I usually have sumatriptan pills to help at the start of one. But when caffeine and these don’t work, I take a ketoralac/tramadol shot IM at home. These help avoid ER visits and hospitalization. It takes about 15 minutes for it to really kick in, but the effect is almost immediate...as if the migraine never happened. When I did go to the ER, tramadol IV instantly removed any pain in my eyes, head and neck. I’ve had no side effects other than about 30 minutes of tenderness where I received the shot (upper arm).   This works for some and not others. Mine is only as needed for severe pain.	9	July 31, 2019	2
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I went to a carnival with my family and hurt my back on one of the rides. I found out later they weren't even supposed to let people on that part of the ride due to the possibility of injury. So I went to an urgent care clinic as soon as they were open cause my pain hadn't got any better. They gave me Toradol it hurt at the injection site and made my back pain about 2x worse than it already  was.  It took over an hour to kick in and only gave me relief for about 15 min I then had to wait 2 hrs at a hospital with orders for xrays in severe pain all because I live an hour away from the hospital. My husband called and complained about it and we found out that because we went in with orders we should have been seen right away. I'm stuck with a useless hospital system that taking over every clinic and service possible in my area.. And since we live in an area with a lot of addicts and pill seekers its impossible to get help when its really needed	1	July 23, 2019	19
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	I suffer from severe chronic daily (every single day!) migraines as well as Trigeminal Neuralgia types 1 & 2. Trigeminal Neuralgia is considered to be the worst possible pain a human can experience, is nicknamed “the suicide disease”, and is extremely difficult to manage. I am beyond grateful for this medication! It helps manage both conditions incredibly well. Someone here complained that it was like pouring acid up your nose and down your throat. They aren’t using it properly. It takes a while to get the hang of it (you have to to you head forward and DO NOT inhale!). The only negative is it can only be used sparingly, as an “emergency” medication for your worst days, because the most you can get is 5 vials per month. But I would be in an awful place without this. It makes me stop screaming out (truly) in Trigeminal pain. I dulls my worst migraines. You just learn to choose your battles. It is strong, effective medication for severe and exquisite pain. I highly recommend it.	10	July 23, 2019	18

Acunivive 90 Injection System	Pain	I had severe back pain for over a year and this took it away completely when I got it. It has been a miracle for me.

Acunivive 90 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	I don't know how it works for pain,  haven't given it enough time to tell.  But you may as well spray acid into your nose/sinuses/throat.... won't use twice.	5	May 15, 2019	5
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I was given IV Toradol for severe pain while in the ER after a bad neck injury .  The injection hurt my vein so bad I thought I was going to pass out.  Took all of my neck pain away for about 30 seconds, then I was back up to an 8.  I was really hoping it would work.	2	May 12, 2019	12
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	I was given this by my neurologist for migraines. I’m also an epileptic so  taking any new meds can cause my seizures to be worse. So it’s been sitting in my fridge for 3 weeks. 4 days ago I had a really bad seizure and with it came the horrible migraine. I took my first dose of Sprix and I felt like I had just spayed pepper spray up my nose! Omg!! It was like an instant panic attack from pain! Once the pain in my nose was gone (about 15 min) I noticed my migraine was almost completely gone. I had to talk myself into taking my second dose. But once I made it past the burn my migraine was completely gone, so yes the Sprix works great on migraines, it was amazing!! My issue is how healthy is this if it comes with that much pain.....?	7	May 10, 2019	11
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I was in the hospital for meningitis and all they would give me for pain was  this rubbish Toradol and Tylenol ! Really?

Second dose was less burning 3rd and 4th dose for the day barely any burning at all. This has taken my pain from an 8-10 down to a 1-2 on the pain scale. I've used this medicine to treat my chronic low back pain myofascial pain syndrome chronic sciatica. The doctor has given me this to get me through until I can get to pain management. I'm already seeing fantastic results I might just continue what this medication.	10	May 2, 2019	14
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	I hate taking this. I mean hate taking it. It burns your nose, it usually makes me feel sick for a couple of days. But it helps so much with pain, even instantly. I would rather deal with a burning nose and sore throat than my fibromyalgia pain so I am grateful for this medication.	10	April 16, 2019	14
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	Was given a toradol shot for sciatica yesterday…totally useless. Still in pain.	1	April 4, 2019	18
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Pain	I received Toradol intravenously in the ER for kidney stone pain. It gave me relief within minutes of them putting in the IV. The pain went from a 10/10 down to about a 3.	8	March 21, 2019	1
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Toradol IV/IM (ketorolac) for Pain	Toradol makes me feel pretty strange and out of it for a few days. It works for post-procedure pain, but I honestly don't know if it's any more effective than just taking ibuprofen. Regardless, I'd rather deal with a headache after my procedure than feel weird and in pain for a few days.	5	March 16, 2019	1
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I pulled the stent from my ureter after having a stone removed and within minutes I was in severe pain. After 2 hours of worsening pain I drove to the urologists office and begged to help relieve the enormous treachery I was enduring. They gave me a shot to my hip and within minutes the pain level dropped from 9 to a 5. The relief was a Godsend. The anti-inflammatory in the drug opened the ureter and allowed blood clots and other debris to filter into the bladder. I was then prescribed toradol in pill form. This got me through the horrific ordeal I had experienced. 	10	February 16, 2019	12
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	I was skeptical and apprehensive about using this medicine after my hip replacement surgery, so for the first 13 days I avoided it. I take piroxicam for my cervical spondylosis and as the days went on the pain in my neck became unbearable, yet my hip pain was minimal. I wasn't able to take the piroxicam with the aspirin I was taking as a blood thinner. This resulted in extreme neck pain and migraine headaches that were debilitating.  I gave in and took the Sprix for the first time when on day 14 I just couldn't function. The pain in my neck and head was intolerable so I had to do something. I took it and within 20 minutes or less the pain had moderated to a level I could stand. Within an hour it was almost completely gone.  I am now a believer. Glad I tried it!	10	February 11, 2019	17
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	This medicine has helped me tremendously with migraines and fibromyalgia. I am unable to take Maxalt or similar drugs due to a reaction so this has been an absolute lifesaver for me!	10	February 4, 2019	9
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I was given a toradol shot for severe sciatica pain.  Might as well have given me an injection of water--NO pain relief whatsoever.	1	February 4, 2019	20
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Toradol IV/IM (ketorolac) for Pain	I had my first kidney stone (I didn't know a human could feel such pain, writhing on the floor, etc.). I got an IV dose of Toradol in the ambulance, and a Toradol pill in the ER. Neither had any effect on the pain. About two hours later, the stone passed on its own, and the pain vanished.	1	January 28, 2019	1
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Toradol IV/IM (ketorolac) for Pain	"Let me see. Toradol? It's a joke. 56 surgeries, body parts that are not mine, shot, stabbed and blown up. 30 years USMC, oh, and I am now told I have CRPS. McGill Pain Scale  is a 1, a ONE for CRPS. Due to all of the surgeries from trauma I have received far too much morphine. Can't tolerate any med but IM demerol for pain. Why this rubbish is even on the market amazes me. Perhaps it is to make the morons we, well some of us, call ""doctor"" feel even more important. Toradol is a waste of $$$ and time."	1	January 24, 2019	0
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Postoperative Pain	I had knee replacement surgery and was given a Hydrocodone combination along with a Ketorolac prescription after leaving the hospital. It worked better on my pain than the opioids prescribed. I did not have any side effects. Wonderful drug.	10	January 11, 2019	2
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	I have to agree with a few others I also wish this could be used for more days than five.  I have fibromyalgia and polio, sprix works great for me I have not experienced burning in my nose or throat as of yet.  I do hope they read the reviews so they can see this medication has helped a lot of us! For me I'm glad I gave this a try 	10	January 9, 2019	12
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I suffer from Chronic kidney stones.  The first time I was given Tordol interveniously and it literally worked within a minute!! I was in so much pain and vomiting from the pain. After the Tordol it relieved the kidney pain immediately.  Now when I’m rushed to hospital or walk in clinic, it’s the first thing I ask for! I’ve never had it as a shot in my muscle, so I can’t give my opinion, but through an IV was awesome. I have had no side effects from it either!		January 7, 2019	8
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Toradol IM (ketorolac) for Pain	I had fallen the day before and ended up the next day with back spasms. These aren't just little twinges, they are like someone is sticking a knife in my back. They are the worst!! I sent in to the doctor's office and they gave me a shot of Toradol. I got absolutely no relief at all. Might as well have been a placebo. I didn't have any side effects from it, which is unusual for me.  My spasms lasted for 12 hours straight before stopping.	1	January 3, 2019	2
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	I have not found that Sprix is very helpful for me. I felt no change in my pain relief. The burning that some have mentioned was not that bad to me. Don't sniff it in. That's not how you are supposed to take it. Make sure to watch the video and it shows exactly how to do it!	3	December 18, 2018	6
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	I'm 38 and have had occasional headaches most of my life.  This is the 1st drug that has been this effective.	10	December 11, 2018	6
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I have chronic kidney stones and they always want to give me toradol IM for the pain. First off, the standards for what constitutes a properly sized muscle need to be reviewed, because 1/3 of the time, they'll give it to me in the deltoid, while the rest of the time, they insist on the gluteus medius. Regardless of where they put it, it doesn't help much with the problem at hand. If I happen to have a headache or sore back at the time, the toradol clears it right up. The severe pain it's meant to treat, on the other hand, barely has the edge taken off. The worst thing is that it causes intense soreness and cramping in the injection site for hours, far worse than a tetanus shot. Some people have good experiences, so it's worth a try to dodge opioids, but don't be afraid to tell them it doesn't work.	3	November 29, 2018	8
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I have MS and pinched nerve in my C spine . When I have a flare up or bad spasticity this drug works great ! Go in , get a shot and literally 1 minute later the pain is relieved .	10	November 29, 2018	3
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	I’ve suffered with migraines for over 10 years. I’ve taken everything and done all kinds of treatment. Including Botox. This nasal spray works within 10 mins. It does burn your nose pretty bad and leaves a horrible taste in your throat. But ..... it’s amazing. My only complaint is once you’ve opened a small bottle you have to dispose in 24hrs. I’ve tried to keep them longer and the medicine just doesn’t work after that time period. I would highly recommend this to anyone with chronic migraines. It had been a life saver	10	November 28, 2018	10
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	They gave me this drug for a pulled muscle in my back, it helped with the pain, but the side effects were not worth it, terrible stomach pain, burning in my stomach, belching, bloating, 3 days since the injection, and my stomach is still not back to normal, I will never take this drug again	1	November 9, 2018	8
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Toradol IM (ketorolac) for Pain	Went to my Primary Care with extreme, crippling menstrual pain (I have cysts and endometriosis). Nurse injected in my arm, I am routinely used to injections and I've never felt such pain from a needle in my life.  My entire arm went numb, I couldn't feel my hand. Then, for a long while afterwards I kept getting shockwaves up and down my arm, like bees stinging inside of my nerves. Not sure if this was the drug or malpractice? Minutes later I was vomiting profusely in the office wastebasket. My arm then developed a large, red circular rash. Apparently this is not a normal reaction. Once I was home, I also got a hideous migraine as a side effect. The drug did relieve my cramps, and knocked me out for a good several hours, but it wasn't worth the headache or the pain in my arm. Never again.	1	October 25, 2018	1
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I had a heart attack in March 2018. In the hospital, they were giving me Morphine for pain. I hated the way it made me feel and it did nothing for the pain. After a day of Morphine I asked that I be given something else, thus my introduction to Toradol. I wish I'd known about Toradol before being given Morphine. It made me feel so much better, without the horrible side effects of Morphine.	10	October 24, 2018	9
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Postoperative Pain	This was given to me after multiple surgeries stemming from a botched gallbladder removal. This drug gave me horrible hallucinations and extremely vivid dreams. It scared me to death out and made me sweat profusely. I don’t ever want anything to do with this drug again.	1	October 3, 2018	6
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Toradol IM (ketorolac) for Pain	Received IM injection. No relief of pain. Caused pain, paresthesia, hyperesthesia and numbness from hip injection site to lateral knee. This persists 6 weeks later. Experienced nausea and violent vomiting for 12 hours as well. I will not take this again	1	September 28, 2018	2
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I get a toradol shot when I get a migraine that lasts longer than a day and when naproxen hasn't help. I have had them help and sometimes they do not.   Got one today and the pain was gone within an hour. Plus the nurse did a great job, no burning sensation after injection. I have been lucky lately, not having a bad burning sensation. I once had a nurse inject it quickly and had the worst burning sensation from it. I think when it is injected slower it's better.   Overall the toradol shot is good for me. I also take hydroxyzine (anti anxiety, antihistamine) at onset of migraine too.  The NASID and antihistamine work very well for me.	9	September 28, 2018	9
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	They always try to give me this when I have a migraine. It has never worked for my pain. They still make me try it before they will even consider giving me anything else. It is no better than 800mg of Advil or Cambia. And I can take that stuff at home without having to pay a copay! So frustrating that this is the first line of defence for a migraine that won’t go away.	2	September 18, 2018	8
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Toradol IV/IM (ketorolac) for Pain	I suffer from severe nerve and back pain. When my gabapentin and norcos can't cut it I go to the ER and get a shot of toradol. I will have electric shooting pains that go down my leg and out my foot every few minutes. 60 mg of Toradol will have me pain-free within an hour. I have gone several times so far. One flare-up was so bad that the shot only stopped it for 24 hrs and I had to go back the next day and get another. Then I was good for a few months till the next bad flare up	10	September 6, 2018	4
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	Toradol right into my sciatic nerve worked for 18 months. Tonight they want to put toradol in my shoulder.  Seems dumb to put toradol into my bloodstream and not where the pain is.		September 6, 2018	4
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	Used this post hip labrum and FAI arthroscopic surgery. Works incredibly well. Never needed to supplement the narcotic pain pills they prescribed. Took Sprix with Tylenol and with ice every hour I was virtually pain free.	10	September 2, 2018	6
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	I had a Superior Hypogastric Plexus Block aka a giant needle guided by x-ray though muscles and spine to numb some nerves for my chronic endometriosis pain. I was given SPRIX to help in my recovery from the injection and it did nothing but make me nauseous. If it helped with the pain I couldn't tell. I think Percocet would do better than this NSAID-SPRIX.  Note: I've got a tolerance for strong meds so it takes a lot of anything to help me when I have severe pain. I think it might help others but isn't strong enough for me.  My dosage was 15.75mg spray in each nose every 6-8 hours. The burn hurts bad, makes me cry and sometimes makes me sneeze. After 1 day of usage with no relief I'm calling my Dr for something else.  FYI: On the other hand this block I get does help my endometriosis pain after the recovery from the injection itself. If you happen to have chronic endo. pain I can recommend this shot.	1	September 1, 2018	3
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	I’ve had Kidney stones for 25 years. I’m now 42. Having a stone 2-5 times a year really sucks. Only a couple years ago my doctor RX’d me Sprix. Yes, it kind of burns the nose a little and drips down your throat and taste horrible . Chase it with some water. It absolutely takes to pain away in a matter of 5-15 minutes tops. So much better than Dilaudid 4mg. Wish I had this years ago. So much easier than having narcotics.	10	August 28, 2018	7
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I got a injection of Toradol when I was admitted the night before I gotten my gallbladder out. I was in so much pain and Dilaudid only helped me for a hour at the most. My nurse finally gave me a shot of Toradol and I could finally sleep. Having a gallstones attack was the worst pain I have ever felt in my life. It lasted until I woke up after surgery and was in my room. I am so grateful that it helped!	10	August 25, 2018	4
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Toradol IM (ketorolac) for Pain	I was in #9+ pain after a cervical (SPINE) nerve cauterizing procedure, (in addition to migraine) & was highly distressed  to get ZERO pain relief.  The drive/additional nausea/pain/stress to get the Toradol shot caused WORSE pain than if I'd known Toradol was the only remedy offered. Toradol is not effective for me at all!	1	August 23, 2018	2
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	I absolutely wish there was a formulation I could take for more than 5 days. If I could take this every day, I could probably go off of my narcotic pain meds. I will agree with many, the taste and burning can be hard but it’s definitely worth it. At least for me.	10	August 19, 2018	8
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	"As most have stated this burns terribly, however I DO NOT CARE! I would take worse pain if its something that will elevate my migraines. I am on a whole host of meds, and I hate medication. I prefer natural means, however nothing worked so here I am. I will do anything to rid myself of these migraines. I have had nerve blocks and a few times gone to the ER for a ""migraine cocktail"" this medication has replaced that need. When living with a violent migraine for 21 days, I would try anything! Having this on hand eliminates that possibility. This DOES WORK! Just push through the initial nose burn and move on. As stated I do not like medication, I have resigned myself to that not being the case, but I do push my limits. I only use this as a last resort and only after a few days of trying everything else.  I hope my rant encourages you to stick through the nose pain. If you do....a clear and quiet mind with NO PAIN, PUKING, LOSS OF VISION, it legit gives you your life back with in a few mins."	8	August 15, 2018	9
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I got a shot of toradol after I went to ER for nerve pain. As soon as she stabbed it in my arm I felt pain. My hand is cramping and have tingling all over my body.	1	August 4, 2018	5
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	I had daily headaches resulting from a concussion. A neurologist put me on Toradol and I could not wait to wean myself off. I had such stabbing pain in both eyes from it I could barely function. I now take Elavil and am very excited not to have headaches! Fingers crossed!		July 26, 2018	6
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Toradol (ketorolac) for Pain	Toradol worked right away on back pain.  The shot hurt a bit,  but now, the next morning, I can't go to work as I have got  diarrhea, chills and fever, heartburn. Just like the side effect list.	9	July 25, 2018	4
Acunivive 90 Injection System	Sprix (ketorolac) for Pain	Sprix burns my nose HORRIBLY! Even if I don’t inhale it later after I sniff just a little it burns every sinus cavity and makes my eyes water and burn. Then when I finally lay back down it burns my throat for about 30 minutes. It feels like I’m shoving jalapeños up my nose and in my sinus cavities. As for the pain it doesn’t help there either. Maybe this medicine is just not for me.	1	July 8, 2018	1
Acuvail		Have dry eye and use drops, I found  Months after cataract surgery pressure around peripheral sides and  Bottom of eye lids , nothing helped much to alleviate the pressure. Had some Acuvail left over and out of desperation on my own I tried some .it worked surprisingly Quite Well . I checked with my Eye Surgeon and he said continue 1 drop each eye morn and eve. GOOD RESULTS	9	October 6, 2017	4
Acyclovir	Cold Sores	I have taken acyclovir sporadically for the last two years. My blood cell count was low so I was forced to go off it for a number of months after beginning treatment. I resumed taking it two months ago and I must admit it has been very good. Before beginning acyclovir I had only 1-2 obs but almost constant nerve pain in the anal region. It had been like this (undiagnosed despite numerous doctor's visits) for around 17 years. After acyclovir began and then stopped because of blood cell count, it was however infinitely worse. I had permanent obs and permanent nerve pain in the anal region, and now I had permanent nerve pain in my vaginal area. my doctor originally prescribed me 400mg twice a day but I found I need to take it 3 times a day in order to quell the obs. I am hoping that in another 10-24 months it will be cured but I am suspending my belief as yet.	7	March 13, 2021	0
Acyclovir	Herpes Simplex	Every few years it occurs, always keep it in reserve because if you are fast enough, a single 800mg can stop it in its tracks, maybe 2 or 3 just to be sure..	10	March 12, 2021	4
Acyclovir	Herpes Simplex	I found out on Tuesday  that I have herpes went to many doctors before got diagnosed with herpes started itching in 2014 didn't know what it was but can someone give me some advice on how to rid myself of it	3	February 19, 2021	0
Acyclovir	Herpes Zoster	I took Acyclovir because of shingles, I had to take 800mg 5x a day for 7 days. On the first day I was okay, second day I felt dizzy and a little  nauseous, third day I had severe nausea! Which was horrible! Other symptoms included ....feeling spaced out , stomach cramping , headache , sweating when I was asleep. It’s better to finish the course which I managed to do ! Thank god! However it did clear my rash away	9	December 17, 2020	0
Acyclovir	Herpes Simplex	My child caught rash on skin. I don’t know where she came in contact with it. We had been on vacations and she was in swimming. It comes back often times every two months. It stays longer when acyclovir is used. I used the cream and the oral liquid and it the outbreak lasted for a long time and it comes back as soon as treatment stops. I’m currently trying essential oils and it clears up faster but I don’t know about the recurrences yet.	1	December 5, 2020	0
Acyclovir	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	I don't know how I got infected with genital herpes - I was with someone who didn't have it so can only assume it had laid dormant for a number of years when someone else had given it to me. The first outbreak was 10 years ago, but was just an itchy spot in my pubic area close to my panty line. The second outbreak came a month or so later and was just a couple of blisters. When I was diagnosed, my whole world collapsed. I was in therapy for 2 years, it really hit me hard. I've taken acyclovir twice a day since then. I haven't had an outbreak but some days I still get the tingling and ache around my pubic area. On those days, I get very low and upset. I may try a different drug.	8	November 14, 2020	6
Acyclovir	Herpes Simplex	I think it worked okay within 3 days my breakout was gone. But I don't like that you have to take it 3 times daily for a week straight then keep taking it for prevention if you get breakouts because I forget half the time. It makes me really sick if I don't eat and I have celiac disease so if you can't eat much like I can't this isn't the right kind for you. Because it's not the right one for me and the pill itself is huge looks like a dungeon and dragon symbol	9	October 31, 2020	1
Acyclovir	Herpes Simplex	I'm 74 years old. First diagnosed 40 years ago so I've been using  Zovirax and acyclovir cream a while. Both have been effective in eliminating or reducing outbreaks. Especially if applied at very first signs of oncoming event. I haven't had a cold sore in that time because I apply the cream when I feel any tingling or raised skin surface. Very little cream is needed to be effective but, several applications a day works best.	10	September 24, 2020	7
Acyclovir	Sitavig (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	I’ve been getting cold sores once-twice a year for the last 5 years. I do not get a small blister that turns my lip slightly red. When one emerges, it is so large and painful that one entire side of lip is completely swollen. It can be so unsightly and painful for those two weeks that I typically don’t leave the house. I’ve always taken Valtrex as quickly as possible upon feeling symptoms and haven’t found it to be effective. The Sitavig, however, has been a godsend. I applied it upon first notice of a small blister forming. The blister still appeared but is small enough that you can’t really see it unless you know what you’re looking for. There is no swelling and very, very little discomfort (slight itching). I’m only on day 2 of the sore and already it’s shrunk. Highly recommend for anyone who gets large, painful cold sores.	8	September 15, 2020	2
Acyclovir	Herpes Simplex	I was diagnosed with herpes this year after getting it from my partner. I had a fairly bad first outbreak on my inner labia and just presumed it to be from shaving but I went to a sexual health clinic and got diagnosed. This medicine has been so helpful anytime I have a tingling/throbbing sensation I take it and it works wonders. I’m currently taking it at the moment and the only real side effect I have is having a headache!		July 29, 2020	7
Acyclovir	Herpes Simplex	I am 43 I just recently got diagnosed with HSV2 with two previous false negative tests. It sucks not 2 know when and where you got the infection from I've never seen any breakouts on any 1 I've been with but I'm seeing you can contract this even with a condom. I have breakouts in more than 1 place inner labial outer labial which I thought was a ingrown hair infection.  Also have a breakout in the anal area but mostly the upper part of the crack which is weird. I hate this. I've been with my bf for 7 yrs he said he had a cold sore before but I don't think he gave it to me by me having 2 false tests. I'm so ashamed as I'd rather have had gonorrhea or chlamydia if I had to suffer from a STD as you can get rid of those. I haven't been able to share this news with my boyfriend as I'm afraid how he may react, he has really tripping about this COVID virus . But I may have had this 4 awhile and luckily I've never transmitted it and this is my first time with an actual blisters.	7	May 22, 2020	18
Acyclovir	Herpes Simplex	My child came in contact on va cction and has a skin rash HSV-1 and this medicine does not work at all for her. I hate to see her so irritated I wish there was an actual cure. I used vinegar and coconut oils and it took just as long to clear as this drug..	1	May 20, 2020	2
Acyclovir	Herpes Simplex	Started taking this after an outbreak. Thought the first one was just irritation from a wax. Realized after that second time it happened that it was definitely herpes and triggered by bikini waxing. Now take this daily to suppress and have not had an outbreak since (over a year). Have found it definitely has caused me to have increased sweating at night, which is annoying, but otherwise no issues.	10	May 11, 2020	7
Acyclovir	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	I had itching for 3 months before my first HSV-2 lesion appeared. It was very mild but I had the fever, swollen lymph nodes and intense burning. I took Acyclovir for 5 days which reduced my symptoms quickly. I am now on 400mg twice daily for suppression, however I still get the odd itch here and there.	9	April 22, 2020	9
Acyclovir	Herpes Simplex	I was getting many cold sores every year. I would take Acyclovir as soon as the numbness started. It never shortened the duration; never had any effect on the pain. The cold sores just kept getting worse. The doctor finally put me on a stronger anti-viral. It did nothing either. I only got headaches from the anti-virals. I finally decided to try vitamin D. I haven't had a cold sore in at least 2 years.	1	April 19, 2020	15
Acyclovir	Herpes Simplex	I was prescribed this meds and it did work, years later I'm still battling with this virus, I never gave it on to anyone, anytime I feel discomfort I call my dr to send a script to the pharmacy. I have had a outbreak on different parts of my vagina and by my anus & mouth. The ones that comes by my vulvar or anus is the worst especially when I urinate I always have that cup of water to pour while I urinate so it wouldn't burn.I'm having an outbreak now I been feeling this itch & painful feeling that got me up. I took a pill about 30 min ago I can honestly tell you Im feeling the med kick in. My pill is 500mg I try to keep some on hands for times like this my dr is close.	10	April 12, 2020	3
Acyclovir	Herpes Zoster	I have herpes zoster (shingles)in  internal, inner ear. Damage to both trigeminal and occipital nerve. Facial paralysis. This medicine possibly saved my life, and the capsule form worked much better than the tablet form for me. It does give me some side effects such as an upset stomach and a weird energizing feeling (less with capsule for me), but if you truly need the medicine, please take it. This virus, if left untreated, can destroy your health and well-being and possibly kill you. Do not underestimate what it can do to your body.	10	April 2, 2020	9
Acyclovir	Herpes Zoster	Relieved my itching and rash after 1 1/2 days	9	February 26, 2020	6
Acyclovir	Herpes Simplex	I had back to back outbreaks after 8 years of no outbreaks at all. I take two 400mg tablets of aciclovir a day and I have not had an outbreak since. It has honestly saved my life. I forget I even carry the virus (I told my partner when we got together) and we have unprotected sex and have not passed it on (I have never transmitted to a partner)  TRY THE MEDS THEY WORK.. thank god	10	February 10, 2020	33
Acyclovir	Herpes Zoster	Discovered I had shingles after reading the Google medical journal lol. Started with mysterious left leg flu like feeling, and excruciating burning pain almost to tears on my left butt cheek. Then bumps on my butt. Decided to take monolaurin (dietary supplement) 3-3x/day for 2 days instead of going to dr. I had no pain and rash was going away. I caved and went to dr to get an Rx of an antiviral so I wouldn’t get post neuralgia. After taking for 2 days I now realize it’s messing with my head. It’s making me feel hopeless and no interest. I am going to discontinue and hope for the best. I will continue with Monolaurin as I think it helped stave off additional outbreaks.	1	February 9, 2020	6
Acyclovir	Herpes Simplex	I had a rash on my hand that my doctor thought (misdiagnosed) was the shingles. I was prescribed acyclovir and I had a severe allergic reaction. It turns out it was Dyshidrosis (pompholyx) blisters on your hands from stress. Chickenpox/shingles are viral, you do not need to take anything except pain medication. I suffered with hives all over my body the size of dinner plates, it felt like I was being burned alive. I was throwing up, lost weight and my skin/face began to show signs of jaundice. I thought I maybe fatal at one point, my skin began to thin to the point I was seeing the coloration of muscle underneath. I still have scars from it. I had these terrible hives for three months until I was given a steroid shot and montelukast. It was a terrible allergic reaction and this medication is known to cause Steven Johnsons Syndrome (SJS), google it because it is terrifying. The hives were gone in 24 hours after getting steroid shot. Do not take this medication, you could get SJS which can be  the end of your life  or ruin your life.		December 29, 2019	7
Acyclovir	Varicella-Zoster	Stuff did absolutely nothing to me . Had to rely on painkillers. That little body lotion is only made to give you hope	1	December 26, 2019	0
Acyclovir	Herpes Zoster	The acyclovir from Camber Drug Co. and shaped like a stop sign don't work very well. The last ones I had from another company worked just fine. But now  I feel like I'm on the start of a big flair. Been taking this stop sign pill shaped pill for 3 weeks. It fails to do what it should do.	3	December 13, 2019	5
Acyclovir	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	First out break of HSV2 at 18,  then  I had NO symptoms at all for 8 YEARS!  Then got back to back out breakouts at 26 years old for 3 months.  Started taking aciclovir 400mg twice a day as suppressive therapy and have had NO symptoms since, for three months.  Side effects minimal.  My advice is just try it because it has saved me :) x	10	December 10, 2019	16
Acyclovir	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	I was diagnosed in Jan this year . But I didn’t know I had it I faintly remember years ago having a cut down there that hurt really bad . ( I think that’s when I got infected ) I’ve been on the acyclovir med coming up on year now. I still get outbreaks frequently.. nothing is working I also have PCOS . I have hsv1 & 2 but never had an outbreak on my mouth . I’ll get little bumps on my nose .	3	December 3, 2019	3
Acyclovir	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	I wasn't told by my sexual partner that they had herpes, I got very ill & was having reproductive problems at the time. I had a few blister type spots and I went to the doctors got acyclovir and it went within 2 days and it's been over a month or 2 now and it hasn't come back.  But he went and continued infecting unsuspecting women.  I'm 21	10	October 12, 2019	11
Acyclovir	Herpes Simplex	Prescribed for cold sore outbreaks, three 400mg  tabs per day, took for 2 days; my heart is racing, cannot concentrate, blood pressure 157/91, my blood pressure was 120/74 two days prior to using this medication, a general feeling of unwellness, 		August 28, 2019	16
Acyclovir	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	I ended up misdiagnosed on several occasions with what felt like a uti and or thrush. After five days of agony and burning fever I knew something was wrong. I had one sore which experts misdiagnosed as a cyst. Finally a GP confirmed my worst fears. An STD in my thirties. I can still count my encounters on one hand but anyone that has sex risk takes the virus and I was just unlucky. I was lucky my partner who was a week into our relationship was so supportive. I take acyclovir as a preventative medication to avoid more breakouts and it works a treat. I get the odd itch but no symtoms. I sometimes feel tired with it and alcohol I have to be careful with. Otherwise I really recommend it for self esteem getting back on your feet and with the whole acceptance aspect. One in six of us have it. This makes it manageable. A vaccine or cure would be better still... But out of all the illnesses and diseases this isn't the worst one.. Count the blessings x	10	August 27, 2019	49
Acyclovir	Herpes Simplex	I've been using Acyclovir for some time now. Sadly I am noticing that it takes longer to work when I am having an outbreak and I am also noticing outbreaks in different places I never had them before. My hair is beginning to fall out which I was never told was a side affect. I am stressing even more having to deal with those  which is cause more frequent outbreaks.	6	August 19, 2019	13
Acyclovir	Herpes Simplex	So I am 65 and haven’t had an outbreak for 4 years.    In the past couple of days I’ve had a burning sensation that comes and goes.   It’s in a different place than I’ve ever had it.   There is absolutely nothing to see, no blisters or sore.   But it is so tender I’m lying around with ice on my crotch.  My jeans shorts were painful to the area.    I have the Acyclovir on hand but how do I know if it’s a herpes outbreak.?   It almost feels like it’s bruised.  Again nothing visible.   Is this a giant outbreak waiting to surface?? Is it harmful to take a corse of it “just to be safe?		August 8, 2019	13
Acyclovir	Herpes Simplex	Stress is NO good for people with HSV2 it activates the virus. I’ve had a rash for about 3 months. Until I got fed up and missed seeing my privates clean and smooth so took a trip to my gyno and she prescribed me acyclovir twice a day and it’s almost clearing up!! On my 5th day of taking the pill.	9	July 28, 2019	15
Acyclovir	Herpes Simplex	Have had HSV-2 for 15 years. Take the pills on a schedule and try to avoid being stressed because this disease will never go away. Eventually you just get use to having it. Stay positive.		July 5, 2019	28
Acyclovir	Herpes Simplex	I am a 30 yr old woman and I recently became diagnosed with genital herpes a few days. I started seeing a guy that didn't know he's infected with it. We had sex one of the times without a condom and BOOM here I am. I started having a burning while peeing a few days later, vaginal irritation, stomach cramping ect. I was given a RX for an UTI. 3 days later, I broke out in a few painful little bumps, and the burning in my urination got worse. Then I got a fever. I went to the ER and the doctor diagnosed me genital herpes. Luckily it's a small localized area she said, and gave me Acyclovir  400 MG to take 3x a day. I'm on the 3rd day and it's a huge difference. The site is healing, it's not burning when I urinate, no more fever, and a lot less discharge. I've gotten some side effects of being very drowsy and tired, and tingling random places. The only thing I hate is the drowsiness. I've been fighting to stay awake at work the past 2 days of it really kicking in.	10	June 27, 2019	23
Acyclovir	Herpes Simplex	I became very irritated down there to the point  it hurt to go to the bathroom I schedule an appointment for the doctor and they told me I had a yeast infection I then noticed bumps down there and they tested for HSV2 (herpes simplex 2) came back positive. Currently day 3 of acyclovir and I am so happy to almost be back to myself. The pain I went through was unbearable... had to call out of work several times because I could barely walk. We will see how this medicine works for me overtime	8	June 10, 2019	18
Acyclovir	Zovirax (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	I get coldsores mainly in the summer, my symptoms start of with dry and itchy lips, and then they start to blister and swell, I recommend if you have the same symptoms as me then put the Zovirax on as SOON AS POSSIBLE! The cold sore feels much better as soon as it’s on, the healing begins straight away, the blister on the mouth begins to dry out so it may feel uncomfortable, because of this I also use Carmex Lip Balm to keep my lips moisturised. I use Zovirax every time I get a cold sore and they heal much faster, for me it’s max 4 days. Amazing product and definietely worth the money!	10	April 14, 2019	8
Acyclovir	Herpes Simplex	"Have had HSV2 for 30 years and take Acyclovir 400 mg for episodic outbreaks. In the ""early years"",I used Zovirax ointment, which is very good, but the tablets are betteras you take the medication early, before the dreadful outbreak, in the form of Acyclovir 400mg/2-3x daily for 3-5 days has been an unbelievable blessing. It IS a horrible disease, but Acyclovir makes it bearable."	10	April 8, 2019	13
Acyclovir	Cold Sores	Summary - If you get a cold sore, use Valacyclovir and Xerese ASAP and don't stop until it is gone!!!    Details - My nose (area between the two nostrils) started getting red Tuesday morning.   I just put Neosporin on it Tuesday night.  I woke up Wed realizing it was a cold sore issue.  I was out of town and didn't have the cold sore meds with me.  I got Valacyclovir filled and immediately starting taking 2 pills in the AM and PM.  I then got Acyclovir cream filled (as Xerese was not available).  I used that cream almost every two hours.  It is very good, but not as optimal as Xerese.  I kept taking both drugs all day Wed and Thursday, even though for Valacyclovir you can stop after 1 day.  I didn't want to chance it.  I got home late Thursday from traveling and swapped out Acyclovir for Xerese.  Results - AMAZING!  All I had was a very tiny scar on Friday afternoon.		March 16, 2019	3
Acyclovir	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	I was diagnosed with HSV-2 six  months ago. The guy I was seeing had told me before we slept together, and we always used condoms, but it was still transmitted. First outbreak was grim and lasted for about a month, huge blisters on my thighs rendered me unable to walk. I stopped dating for a long time because I couldn't seem to control the outbreaks, and it seemed I was getting them back-to-back every week (although they never came out as full sores, just slight itching and discomfort). I started taking suppressive acyclovir (2 x 400mg per day) after 4 months, and so far the 'outbreaks' have just been itchy with no visible sores. Though I do still get them frequently despite leading a healthy, for the most part stress-free lifestyle. I will continue to take suppressive acyclovir for the foreseeable future to see if my body can eventually adjust to the virus.	7	February 9, 2019	13
Acyclovir	Herpes Simplex	When using oral and cream at onset gets rid of them fast. But remember this oral stuff  really bad on the liver. If outbreaks are like a few times a year not to worry. If down in Mexico can get for a fraction of the cost then in the states.	10	January 25, 2019	6
Acyclovir	Sitavig (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	This stuff is amazing! At first it was difficult to apply to gums (it is a tablet you stick on your gums and you don't swallow it). It say sto use round side to apply to gums but I found it easier to use flat side of tablet. If you catch it in time you just get a tiny bump and it goes down by the next day. I haven't had a bad blister in over a year. Use to get them 3 to 4 times a year. Now, maybe 2. If u don't have insurance this medication will be expensive unfortunately.	9	January 19, 2019	2
Acyclovir	Herpes Simplex	My fiance and I discovered, in the beginning of our relationship, that we both had genital herpes. My first outbreak was the ABSOLUTE worst experience, I was so sick. We suffered for 2 years, had constant breakouts and then finally we decided to both respectively take acyclovir. Doses are 800 mg tablet every day, and honest to goodness it was a miracle drug. We have been on it for 3 months now and except for an occasional itch here and there that lasts for a day and then goes away, neither of us have had the lesions or the terrible symptoms. We do not take it when we feel symptoms; instead, we take 800mg every day, possibly for the rest of our lives but that's okay so long as we never have to experience another outbreak!!	10	December 5, 2018	20
Acyclovir	Cold Sores	Its no exaggeration that cold sores on my lips has in a way, been ruining my life. It has ended relationships, and I've learned to become ashamed. I had a boyfriend in high school who kissed me with one and now I get them several times a year, and in the winter its back to back. Its horrible.  But this drug is a life saver. I wake up with mine, no tingles. I blast them instantly with 2 at a time ever few hours, and by the end of the night the blisters will cease. What took a week to two weeks to heal now only takes days, sometimes its not even noticeable at all. I now take this everyday to prevent outbreaks. This is a huge relief in my life. I recommend for anyone who suffers like me!	10	November 29, 2018	18
Acyclovir	Herpes Simplex	taking 400mg once a day works for me to prevent outbreaks		October 30, 2018	7
Acyclovir	Cold Sores	I'm a 35 year old female who has suffered from cold sores for so long I have pictures of me as a 3 year old with them, almost every year book picture, me with a cold sore. Every period, stressed, every Holiday. I was prescribed Acyclovir at 33 years old after giving birth to my first child. I had an outbreak and worried about my son catching the virus from me (Herpes is dangerous/deadly for infants) as my mother was so irresponsible when I caught it young. It's amazing, I remember thinking as a small child If given 3 wishes, one would be never get Cold sores again. I'd been on it and hadn't experienced one in almost 2 years. I'm very grateful l I'd never experienced ocular or genital herpes and have great sympathy for those who do. Acyclovir is a miracle for me	10	September 30, 2018	11
Acyclovir	Cold Sores	I use this drug for the occasional cold sore that I get on and/or around my mouth. I live in Mexico and found this drug over the counter. Super sad to hear the cream costs $200 !! Here a 5g tube and 50 tabs of 400 mg tablets cost me a whopping $7 USD. I have a few different tubes so I can have it available if I ever feel a tingle.  And since it’s so cheap if I see even a stranger with a cold sore I offer it to them. It is a miracle worker for me. If I am fortunate enough to catch it in time to take a pill it rarely goes to a full blister. And if it does it is contained to a very slight bump. For me it also relieves any discomfort.	10	September 19, 2018	6
Acyclovir	Herpes Simplex	After trying A LOT of different things Acyclovir is definitely what you need to be taking ASAP. As soon as you feel any tingling at all. If you are unfortunate enough to have reached the weeping sores phase I found the only thing to soothe the pain was salt water with black tea. Pop a tea bag in with hot very salty water and cleanse your intimate area once cool enough. Sounds mad but you'll thank me after!	8	September 5, 2018	15
Acyclovir	Herpes Zoster	I had  herpes zoster in April 2017, was  prescribed   acyclovir 400mg x2  with anti-allergic tabs  for seven days and  was cured  although  after-effects were felt for long.   Interestingly,  I also got rid of another medical condition that had been  bothering me for more than a year prior to the  herpes   attack.  After one year,  symptoms of  old  problem (not herpes) developed again.  I told  doctor about the effect  acyclovir tabs had on it a year ago.  But the doctor laughed away  my observations  and  prescribed  other medicines.  When  I didn't get  relief even after my third visit to her, she reluctantly prescribed acyclovir tabs.  I was completely cured after eight days. Before going public with full details,   I would like to share it with  manufacturers of acyclovir tabs.  They may like to initiate some more research on this wonderful drug and arrive at a definitive conclusion vis-a-vis my observations.    I may  offer myself for  clinical trials, if necessary.	10	August 19, 2018	8
Acyclovir	Zovirax (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	Took one ten day course of this anti-viral over seven years ago and have never had even a hint of another fever blister symptom ever since.   I felt better after first week, and remarkably stronger after completing  the 10 day prescription . Next best thing to a cure.	9	July 9, 2018	15

Acyclovir	Herpes Simplex	Great drug .. it’s a shame the cream is so expensive. Tablet for relatively inexpensive. Why is the ointment so expensive?		May 6, 2018	5
Acyclovir	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	My first outbreak was horrific. I could not walk for a week the pain was so unbearable. I laid in bed the whole time with cold packs between my legs and dreaded when having to use the bathroom because the pain was excruciating. I started this medication 4 days after I was infected and had symptoms. It did help and I have been on it for a couple of months now and no side effects. My doctor wants me to be on it for 2 years for suppressive therapy and then try to get off of it. She did inform me however that if I had several outbreaks, she had no problem putting me back on it. She assured me it was safe longterm. There have been times I have forgotten to take my meds and within a few days I have some symptoms, but then I start back up again and in a few days, I am feeling better. This medicine truly allows me to forget that I have HSV-2, other than when I take my meds. It’s been a miracle for me.	10	March 25, 2018	14
Acyclovir	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	I've had fever blisters since I was a child. When I was a teenager I got fever blisters a lot.  As I got older usually just in the summer. About 4 years  ago I was getting them every other month. Dr put me on 400mg twice daily. Have not had any in the last year and a half.  What a difference its made in my life!	10	March 25, 2018	5
Acyclovir	Sitavig (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	Works wonders, but takes a full 24 hours of awkwardly sitting on my gums before dissolving.	8	March 9, 2018	4
Acyclovir	Cold Sores	16 years ago I was accidentally poked in my eye. The following day my eye flared up  very inflamed and painful. I was diagnosed  with viral keratitis (cold sore virus in the eye).  About 5 years later they finally put me on zovirax  tablets 800mg. I found them great. Didn't take long for to clear it up  while also using zovirax  eye ointment  I have had less breakouts over the years compared to the 3 or 4 a year I had been experiencing before be I got prescribed this. These tablets were the answer to my prayers as it's extremely painful when I have an outbreak in my eyes. I currently have an outbreak and my doctor has me on 400mg five times a day as well as  the eye ointment. I've found with this medication the breakouts are less  frequent and the symptoms less severe. Also this  is free for me as it's cover by medical card which is great. No side effects. For me I would highly recommend  zovirax aka adviclor  to anyone  wanting to treat an outbreak	10	February 23, 2018	3
Acyclovir	Herpes Simplex	For the last year I've been plagued with severe cold sore/herpes outbreaks around my lips, chin and nose. A never ending cycle of breakout, heal, breakout. After one day of using the cream and Acyclovir the large bump on the side of my lip flattened to the point of not noticing it. Day six and I haven't seen my face look this clear in years. One little teeny whitehead popped up last night below my lip but you can't tell its a herpes sore.  It kind of seemed like a final whimper. If I could rate prior breakouts as a 10 for worst case scenario, this little guy would be a 1. And I'd even thank someone for it. One last thing, If you're insured look around for community health centers, call them and ask for a low cost pharmacy to fill your prescription. I've read online the same Zovirax cream prescription goes for $200, and Acyclovir anywhere from $80-200. I paid $100 for both. Do some research!	10	February 19, 2018	5
Acyclovir	Cold Sores	Great medicine I've never experienced side effects that I'm aware of and took while pregnant.	10	February 1, 2018	3
Acyclovir	Herpes Simplex	I had HSV-2 in my 20s.  My doctor gave me a strong prescription of Zyclovair and I think it was for 30 days.  I never had an outbreak again.  The outbreak that I was seen for, was my first and only one and it was really quite bad.  Now I am 49 without a herpes outbreak following the treatment.	10	January 16, 2018	32
Acyclovir	Herpes Simplex	I’ve been having cold sores since I was 12 on my lips and face. I tried everything and nothing would work. My doctor prescribed me this when he realized how serious it was. I was getting them sometimes one right after the other one!  I’m supposed to take one gram a day, but I found that when I did that I still got them frequently. So I only take it when I feel a tingle , I take about 4 and it never comes out. What sucks is when I don’t get the tingle and I just wake up with a full blow on sore/sores. Overall medicine really helps though! Completely free with my insurance as well!	7	October 22, 2017	2
Acyclovir	Herpes Simplex	Been taking this medicine for two years with no outbreaks and no side effects. It's been life changing.	10	September 14, 2017	15
Acyclovir	Cold Sores	My experience is that I have had cold sores ONLY on my lips from age 6 to 35. I agreed to a 1st date...bam! I felt it. That is the key; take meds once 1st felt. I have no medical knowledge except I know what my body tolerates and what has been successful which may not be your best bet but be safe careful and consult you Dr b4 any treatment plan.  1. break up your pills in half for immediate absorbtion take 800mg every 2 hours to slam your system to alert it there's an issue and send in a 2nd round of 800 within 1st 4 hours 2. continue 800 for 2 days every 4 hours 3. apply Abreva or similar product on the sore at first sensation, while taking the meds so you are attacking the infection from inside (meds) and externally (creme on sore) 4 days	9	August 23, 2017	8

Acyclovir	Herpes Simplex	I'm 48 and I was diagnosed with genital herpes when I was 35. I started dating a new guy and within 2 weeks I felt horrible burning when I urinated. I went to my midwives and sure enough I had herpes. Funny thing is I wasn't with anyone prior to him and I was with him for 6 years and not once did he ever test positive. They actually claim I could have had it on my face touched it and touched my genitals without washing my hands and transferred it. The outbreaks are less and less over the years but when I feel one coming I take acyclovir 500mg 2x daily. It helps right away. And I use a squirt bottle with warm water as I urinated to help reduce the burning.	10	July 1, 2017	21
Acyclovir	Herpes Simplex	Good day to every one reading this, I am here to give my testimony about a  herbal doctor  called dr tokubo who helped me in my life. I was infected with HERPES SIMPLEX virus in 2015, i went to many hospitals for cure and they told me there was no solution for it, so I was thinking how i can  get a solution so that my body can be okay. One day I was in the river side thinking where I can go to get solution, Along the line a lady walked to me telling me why am I so sad and i open up all to her telling her my problem, she told me that she can help me out, she introduce me to a doctor who uses herbal medication to cure HERPES SIMPLEX virus and gave me his email, so i mail him to order for his herbal medicine.

Acyclovir	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	I have found that acyclovir works better for me when I take pine cone extract. I believe this extract works as an adjuvant, increases the potency of this antiviral drug.  I have been using this combination for several years and have had only two outbreaks in 3 years apposed to 3-4 a year when only using acyclovir 400 mg daily. This makes me believe that the extract is working.  Research suggests that certain compounds found in pine cone extract increases specific Dendritic immune cells.	8	June 1, 2017	14
Acyclovir	Cold Sores	It gave me prostate issues and erection problems. I never had a breakout. The trade off wasn't worth it.		May 17, 2017	1
Acyclovir	Herpes Simplex	I found out I contracted genital herpes from an ex boyfriend about 5 years ago. It initially felt like a cut on my vagina that itched and burned. Went to Dr next day and sure enough- herpes (ugh). I take the medicine as needed and it works like a charm. If I do feel one coming I take 400mg  three day for about 4-5 days. Clears right up. I also used to get cold sore a few times a year- haven't since taking this medicine. It's AMAZING. Just wish I never had to find out about it.	9	April 5, 2017	25
Acyclovir	Herpes Simplex	At 29 weeks pregnant I had a fever. Thought I was leaking amniotic fluid. Went to the hospital and misdiagnosed with a UTI. Stayed overnight with IVF and antibiotics and checked, monitored and ultrasound before discharged the following day. 24 hours later still not having felt well went back to the hospital and rechecked, water broke dilated to 2 and Dr said she didn't think of it before, but was going to test and treat me for Genital Herpes. Right after the emergency c section. 	7	April 4, 2017	5
Acyclovir	Herpes Simplex	About 5 days ago I realized a cut, I thought I had cut myself while shaving... it then got very uncomfortable and burned while I urinated. Finally, I took my camera down there and wanted to look... I noticed a few more cuts  that look like canker sores so I made an appointment right away. She told me it looked like genital herpes. She gave my the cream and the pills. It's only been a day and it doesn't feel like it's working. I know it's soon. But I still feel like I'm on fire, I'm itchy, and it still burns like crazy. Is there anything else I can do?	2	March 29, 2017	17
Acyclovir	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	I have found this drug to be very effective in controlling my IBS/ inflammatory bowel disease.  Clearly it's possible herpes has a role to play in these conditions.	9	March 7, 2017	12
Acyclovir	Herpes Simplex	This is the only thing that works for myself stress induced break outs (college). I use both the pills and the cream. I believe when I first started using acyclovir it was more effective  and now it can take a good 4-5 days to fully heal. This is nothing in comparison to a cold sore that lasted a month without the meds though! 400mg. Free with my healthcare for the pills, the cream was $25.	9	February 22, 2017	8
Acyclovir (Systemic)	Cold Sores	I have taken acyclovir sporadically for the last two years. My blood cell count was low so I was forced to go off it for a number of months after beginning treatment. I resumed taking it two months ago and I must admit it has been very good. Before beginning acyclovir I had only 1-2 obs but almost constant nerve pain in the anal region. It had been like this (undiagnosed despite numerous doctor's visits) for around 17 years. After acyclovir began and then stopped because of blood cell count, it was however infinitely worse. I had permanent obs and permanent nerve pain in the anal region, and now I had permanent nerve pain in my vaginal area. my doctor originally prescribed me 400mg twice a day but I found I need to take it 3 times a day in order to quell the obs. I am hoping that in another 10-24 months it will be cured but I am suspending my belief as yet.	7	March 13, 2021	0
Acyclovir (Systemic)	Herpes Simplex	Every few years it occurs, always keep it in reserve because if you are fast enough, a single 800mg can stop it in its tracks, maybe 2 or 3 just to be sure..	10	March 12, 2021	4

Acyclovir (Systemic)	Herpes Zoster	I took Acyclovir because of shingles, I had to take 800mg 5x a day for 7 days. On the first day I was okay, second day I felt dizzy and a little  nauseous, third day I had severe nausea! Which was horrible! Other symptoms included ....feeling spaced out , stomach cramping , headache , sweating when I was asleep. It’s better to finish the course which I managed to do ! Thank god! However it did clear my rash away	9	December 17, 2020	0
Acyclovir (Systemic)	Herpes Simplex	My child caught rash on skin. I don’t know where she came in contact with it. We had been on vacations and she was in swimming. It comes back often times every two months. It stays longer when acyclovir is used. I used the cream and the oral liquid and it the outbreak lasted for a long time and it comes back as soon as treatment stops. I’m currently trying essential oils and it clears up faster but I don’t know about the recurrences yet.	1	December 5, 2020	0
Acyclovir (Systemic)	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	I don't know how I got infected with genital herpes - I was with someone who didn't have it so can only assume it had laid dormant for a number of years when someone else had given it to me. The first outbreak was 10 years ago, but was just an itchy spot in my pubic area close to my panty line. The second outbreak came a month or so later and was just a couple of blisters. When I was diagnosed, my whole world collapsed. I was in therapy for 2 years, it really hit me hard. I've taken acyclovir twice a day since then. I haven't had an outbreak but some days I still get the tingling and ache around my pubic area. On those days, I get very low and upset. I may try a different drug.	8	November 14, 2020	6
Acyclovir (Systemic)	Herpes Simplex	I think it worked okay within 3 days my breakout was gone. But I don't like that you have to take it 3 times daily for a week straight then keep taking it for prevention if you get breakouts because I forget half the time. It makes me really sick if I don't eat and I have celiac disease so if you can't eat much like I can't this isn't the right kind for you. Because it's not the right one for me and the pill itself is huge looks like a dungeon and dragon symbol	9	October 31, 2020	1
Acyclovir (Systemic)	Herpes Simplex	I'm 74 years old. First diagnosed 40 years ago so I've been using  Zovirax and acyclovir cream a while. Both have been effective in eliminating or reducing outbreaks. Especially if applied at very first signs of oncoming event. I haven't had a cold sore in that time because I apply the cream when I feel any tingling or raised skin surface. Very little cream is needed to be effective but, several applications a day works best.	10	September 24, 2020	7
Acyclovir (Systemic)	Sitavig (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	I’ve been getting cold sores once-twice a year for the last 5 years. I do not get a small blister that turns my lip slightly red. When one emerges, it is so large and painful that one entire side of lip is completely swollen. It can be so unsightly and painful for those two weeks that I typically don’t leave the house. I’ve always taken Valtrex as quickly as possible upon feeling symptoms and haven’t found it to be effective. The Sitavig, however, has been a godsend. I applied it upon first notice of a small blister forming. The blister still appeared but is small enough that you can’t really see it unless you know what you’re looking for. There is no swelling and very, very little discomfort (slight itching). I’m only on day 2 of the sore and already it’s shrunk. Highly recommend for anyone who gets large, painful cold sores.	8	September 15, 2020	2
Acyclovir (Systemic)	Herpes Simplex	I was diagnosed with herpes this year after getting it from my partner. I had a fairly bad first outbreak on my inner labia and just presumed it to be from shaving but I went to a sexual health clinic and got diagnosed. This medicine has been so helpful anytime I have a tingling/throbbing sensation I take it and it works wonders. I’m currently taking it at the moment and the only real side effect I have is having a headache!		July 29, 2020	7
Acyclovir (Systemic)	Herpes Simplex	I am 43 I just recently got diagnosed with HSV2 with two previous false negative tests. It sucks not 2 know when and where you got the infection from I've never seen any breakouts on any 1 I've been with but I'm seeing you can contract this even with a condom. I have breakouts in more than 1 place inner labial outer labial which I thought was a ingrown hair infection.  Also have a breakout in the anal area but mostly the upper part of the crack which is weird. I hate this. I've been with my bf for 7 yrs he said he had a cold sore before but I don't think he gave it to me by me having 2 false tests. I'm so ashamed as I'd rather have had gonorrhea or chlamydia if I had to suffer from a STD as you can get rid of those. I haven't been able to share this news with my boyfriend as I'm afraid how he may react, he has really tripping about this COVID virus . But I may have had this 4 awhile and luckily I've never transmitted it and this is my first time with an actual blisters.	7	May 22, 2020	18
Acyclovir (Systemic)	Herpes Simplex	My child came in contact on va cction and has a skin rash HSV-1 and this medicine does not work at all for her. I hate to see her so irritated I wish there was an actual cure. I used vinegar and coconut oils and it took just as long to clear as this drug..	1	May 20, 2020	2
Acyclovir (Systemic)	Herpes Simplex	Started taking this after an outbreak. Thought the first one was just irritation from a wax. Realized after that second time it happened that it was definitely herpes and triggered by bikini waxing. Now take this daily to suppress and have not had an outbreak since (over a year). Have found it definitely has caused me to have increased sweating at night, which is annoying, but otherwise no issues.	10	May 11, 2020	7
Acyclovir (Systemic)	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	I had itching for 3 months before my first HSV-2 lesion appeared. It was very mild but I had the fever, swollen lymph nodes and intense burning. I took Acyclovir for 5 days which reduced my symptoms quickly. I am now on 400mg twice daily for suppression, however I still get the odd itch here and there.	9	April 22, 2020	9
Acyclovir (Systemic)	Herpes Simplex	I was getting many cold sores every year. I would take Acyclovir as soon as the numbness started. It never shortened the duration; never had any effect on the pain. The cold sores just kept getting worse. The doctor finally put me on a stronger anti-viral. It did nothing either. I only got headaches from the anti-virals. I finally decided to try vitamin D. I haven't had a cold sore in at least 2 years.	1	April 19, 2020	15
Acyclovir (Systemic)	Herpes Simplex	I was prescribed this meds and it did work, years later I'm still battling with this virus, I never gave it on to anyone, anytime I feel discomfort I call my dr to send a script to the pharmacy. I have had a outbreak on different parts of my vagina and by my anus & mouth. The ones that comes by my vulvar or anus is the worst especially when I urinate I always have that cup of water to pour while I urinate so it wouldn't burn.I'm having an outbreak now I been feeling this itch & painful feeling that got me up. I took a pill about 30 min ago I can honestly tell you Im feeling the med kick in. My pill is 500mg I try to keep some on hands for times like this my dr is close.	10	April 12, 2020	3
Acyclovir (Systemic)	Herpes Zoster	I have herpes zoster (shingles)in  internal, inner ear. Damage to both trigeminal and occipital nerve. Facial paralysis. This medicine possibly saved my life, and the capsule form worked much better than the tablet form for me. It does give me some side effects such as an upset stomach and a weird energizing feeling (less with capsule for me), but if you truly need the medicine, please take it. This virus, if left untreated, can destroy your health and well-being and possibly kill you. Do not underestimate what it can do to your body.	10	April 2, 2020	9
Acyclovir (Systemic)	Herpes Zoster	Relieved my itching and rash after 1 1/2 days	9	February 26, 2020	6
Acyclovir (Systemic)	Herpes Simplex	I had back to back outbreaks after 8 years of no outbreaks at all. I take two 400mg tablets of aciclovir a day and I have not had an outbreak since. It has honestly saved my life. I forget I even carry the virus (I told my partner when we got together) and we have unprotected sex and have not passed it on (I have never transmitted to a partner)  TRY THE MEDS THEY WORK.. thank god	10	February 10, 2020	33
Acyclovir (Systemic)	Herpes Zoster	Discovered I had shingles after reading the Google medical journal lol. Started with mysterious left leg flu like feeling, and excruciating burning pain almost to tears on my left butt cheek. Then bumps on my butt. Decided to take monolaurin (dietary supplement) 3-3x/day for 2 days instead of going to dr. I had no pain and rash was going away. I caved and went to dr to get an Rx of an antiviral so I wouldn’t get post neuralgia. After taking for 2 days I now realize it’s messing with my head. It’s making me feel hopeless and no interest. I am going to discontinue and hope for the best. I will continue with Monolaurin as I think it helped stave off additional outbreaks.	1	February 9, 2020	6
Acyclovir (Systemic)	Herpes Simplex	I had a rash on my hand that my doctor thought (misdiagnosed) was the shingles. I was prescribed acyclovir and I had a severe allergic reaction. It turns out it was Dyshidrosis (pompholyx) blisters on your hands from stress. Chickenpox/shingles are viral, you do not need to take anything except pain medication. I suffered with hives all over my body the size of dinner plates, it felt like I was being burned alive. I was throwing up, lost weight and my skin/face began to show signs of jaundice. I thought I maybe fatal at one point, my skin began to thin to the point I was seeing the coloration of muscle underneath. I still have scars from it. I had these terrible hives for three months until I was given a steroid shot and montelukast. It was a terrible allergic reaction and this medication is known to cause Steven Johnsons Syndrome (SJS), google it because it is terrifying. The hives were gone in 24 hours after getting steroid shot. Do not take this medication, you could get SJS which can be  the end of your life  or ruin your life.		December 29, 2019	7
Acyclovir (Systemic)	Varicella-Zoster	Stuff did absolutely nothing to me . Had to rely on painkillers. That little body lotion is only made to give you hope	1	December 26, 2019	0
Acyclovir (Systemic)	Herpes Zoster	The acyclovir from Camber Drug Co. and shaped like a stop sign don't work very well. The last ones I had from another company worked just fine. But now  I feel like I'm on the start of a big flair. Been taking this stop sign pill shaped pill for 3 weeks. It fails to do what it should do.	3	December 13, 2019	5
Acyclovir (Systemic)	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	First out break of HSV2 at 18,  then  I had NO symptoms at all for 8 YEARS!  Then got back to back out breakouts at 26 years old for 3 months.  Started taking aciclovir 400mg twice a day as suppressive therapy and have had NO symptoms since, for three months.  Side effects minimal.  My advice is just try it because it has saved me :) x	10	December 10, 2019	16
Acyclovir (Systemic)	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	I was diagnosed in Jan this year . But I didn’t know I had it I faintly remember years ago having a cut down there that hurt really bad . ( I think that’s when I got infected ) I’ve been on the acyclovir med coming up on year now. I still get outbreaks frequently.. nothing is working I also have PCOS . I have hsv1 & 2 but never had an outbreak on my mouth . I’ll get little bumps on my nose .	3	December 3, 2019	3
Acyclovir (Systemic)	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	I wasn't told by my sexual partner that they had herpes, I got very ill & was having reproductive problems at the time. I had a few blister type spots and I went to the doctors got acyclovir and it went within 2 days and it's been over a month or 2 now and it hasn't come back.  But he went and continued infecting unsuspecting women.  I'm 21	10	October 12, 2019	11
Acyclovir (Systemic)	Herpes Simplex	Prescribed for cold sore outbreaks, three 400mg  tabs per day, took for 2 days; my heart is racing, cannot concentrate, blood pressure 157/91, my blood pressure was 120/74 two days prior to using this medication, a general feeling of unwellness, 		August 28, 2019	16
Acyclovir (Systemic)	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	I ended up misdiagnosed on several occasions with what felt like a uti and or thrush. After five days of agony and burning fever I knew something was wrong. I had one sore which experts misdiagnosed as a cyst. Finally a GP confirmed my worst fears. An STD in my thirties. I can still count my encounters on one hand but anyone that has sex risk takes the virus and I was just unlucky. I was lucky my partner who was a week into our relationship was so supportive. I take acyclovir as a preventative medication to avoid more breakouts and it works a treat. I get the odd itch but no symtoms. I sometimes feel tired with it and alcohol I have to be careful with. Otherwise I really recommend it for self esteem getting back on your feet and with the whole acceptance aspect. One in six of us have it. This makes it manageable. A vaccine or cure would be better still... But out of all the illnesses and diseases this isn't the worst one.. Count the blessings x	10	August 27, 2019	49
Acyclovir (Systemic)	Herpes Simplex	I've been using Acyclovir for some time now. Sadly I am noticing that it takes longer to work when I am having an outbreak and I am also noticing outbreaks in different places I never had them before. My hair is beginning to fall out which I was never told was a side affect. I am stressing even more having to deal with those  which is cause more frequent outbreaks.	6	August 19, 2019	13
Acyclovir (Systemic)	Herpes Simplex	So I am 65 and haven’t had an outbreak for 4 years.    In the past couple of days I’ve had a burning sensation that comes and goes.   It’s in a different place than I’ve ever had it.   There is absolutely nothing to see, no blisters or sore.   But it is so tender I’m lying around with ice on my crotch.  My jeans shorts were painful to the area.    I have the Acyclovir on hand but how do I know if it’s a herpes outbreak.?   It almost feels like it’s bruised.  Again nothing visible.   Is this a giant outbreak waiting to surface?? Is it harmful to take a corse of it “just to be safe?		August 8, 2019	13
Acyclovir (Systemic)	Herpes Simplex	Stress is NO good for people with HSV2 it activates the virus. I’ve had a rash for about 3 months. Until I got fed up and missed seeing my privates clean and smooth so took a trip to my gyno and she prescribed me acyclovir twice a day and it’s almost clearing up!! On my 5th day of taking the pill.	9	July 28, 2019	15
Acyclovir (Systemic)	Herpes Simplex	Have had HSV-2 for 15 years. Take the pills on a schedule and try to avoid being stressed because this disease will never go away. Eventually you just get use to having it. Stay positive.		July 5, 2019	28
Acyclovir (Systemic)	Herpes Simplex	I am a 30 yr old woman and I recently became diagnosed with genital herpes a few days. I started seeing a guy that didn't know he's infected with it. We had sex one of the times without a condom and BOOM here I am. I started having a burning while peeing a few days later, vaginal irritation, stomach cramping ect. I was given a RX for an UTI. 3 days later, I broke out in a few painful little bumps, and the burning in my urination got worse. Then I got a fever. I went to the ER and the doctor diagnosed me genital herpes. Luckily it's a small localized area she said, and gave me Acyclovir  400 MG to take 3x a day. I'm on the 3rd day and it's a huge difference. The site is healing, it's not burning when I urinate, no more fever, and a lot less discharge. I've gotten some side effects of being very drowsy and tired, and tingling random places. The only thing I hate is the drowsiness. I've been fighting to stay awake at work the past 2 days of it really kicking in.	10	June 27, 2019	23
Acyclovir (Systemic)	Herpes Simplex	I became very irritated down there to the point  it hurt to go to the bathroom I schedule an appointment for the doctor and they told me I had a yeast infection I then noticed bumps down there and they tested for HSV2 (herpes simplex 2) came back positive. Currently day 3 of acyclovir and I am so happy to almost be back to myself. The pain I went through was unbearable... had to call out of work several times because I could barely walk. We will see how this medicine works for me overtime	8	June 10, 2019	18
Acyclovir (Systemic)	Zovirax (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	I get coldsores mainly in the summer, my symptoms start of with dry and itchy lips, and then they start to blister and swell, I recommend if you have the same symptoms as me then put the Zovirax on as SOON AS POSSIBLE! The cold sore feels much better as soon as it’s on, the healing begins straight away, the blister on the mouth begins to dry out so it may feel uncomfortable, because of this I also use Carmex Lip Balm to keep my lips moisturised. I use Zovirax every time I get a cold sore and they heal much faster, for me it’s max 4 days. Amazing product and definietely worth the money!	10	April 14, 2019	8
Acyclovir (Systemic)	Herpes Simplex	"Have had HSV2 for 30 years and take Acyclovir 400 mg for episodic outbreaks. In the ""early years"",I used Zovirax ointment, which is very good, but the tablets are betteras you take the medication early, before the dreadful outbreak, in the form of Acyclovir 400mg/2-3x daily for 3-5 days has been an unbelievable blessing. It IS a horrible disease, but Acyclovir makes it bearable."	10	April 8, 2019	13
Acyclovir (Systemic)	Cold Sores	Summary - If you get a cold sore, use Valacyclovir and Xerese ASAP and don't stop until it is gone!!!    Details - My nose (area between the two nostrils) started getting red Tuesday morning.   I just put Neosporin on it Tuesday night.  I woke up Wed realizing it was a cold sore issue.  I was out of town and didn't have the cold sore meds with me.  I got Valacyclovir filled and immediately starting taking 2 pills in the AM and PM.  I then got Acyclovir cream filled (as Xerese was not available).  I used that cream almost every two hours.  It is very good, but not as optimal as Xerese.  I kept taking both drugs all day Wed and Thursday, even though for Valacyclovir you can stop after 1 day.  I didn't want to chance it.  I got home late Thursday from traveling and swapped out Acyclovir for Xerese.  Results - AMAZING!  All I had was a very tiny scar on Friday afternoon.		March 16, 2019	3
Acyclovir (Systemic)	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	I was diagnosed with HSV-2 six  months ago. The guy I was seeing had told me before we slept together, and we always used condoms, but it was still transmitted. First outbreak was grim and lasted for about a month, huge blisters on my thighs rendered me unable to walk. I stopped dating for a long time because I couldn't seem to control the outbreaks, and it seemed I was getting them back-to-back every week (although they never came out as full sores, just slight itching and discomfort). I started taking suppressive acyclovir (2 x 400mg per day) after 4 months, and so far the 'outbreaks' have just been itchy with no visible sores. Though I do still get them frequently despite leading a healthy, for the most part stress-free lifestyle. I will continue to take suppressive acyclovir for the foreseeable future to see if my body can eventually adjust to the virus.	7	February 9, 2019	13
Acyclovir (Systemic)	Herpes Simplex	When using oral and cream at onset gets rid of them fast. But remember this oral stuff  really bad on the liver. If outbreaks are like a few times a year not to worry. If down in Mexico can get for a fraction of the cost then in the states.	10	January 25, 2019	6
Acyclovir (Systemic)	Sitavig (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	This stuff is amazing! At first it was difficult to apply to gums (it is a tablet you stick on your gums and you don't swallow it). It say sto use round side to apply to gums but I found it easier to use flat side of tablet. If you catch it in time you just get a tiny bump and it goes down by the next day. I haven't had a bad blister in over a year. Use to get them 3 to 4 times a year. Now, maybe 2. If u don't have insurance this medication will be expensive unfortunately.	9	January 19, 2019	2
Acyclovir (Systemic)	Herpes Simplex	My fiance and I discovered, in the beginning of our relationship, that we both had genital herpes. My first outbreak was the ABSOLUTE worst experience, I was so sick. We suffered for 2 years, had constant breakouts and then finally we decided to both respectively take acyclovir. Doses are 800 mg tablet every day, and honest to goodness it was a miracle drug. We have been on it for 3 months now and except for an occasional itch here and there that lasts for a day and then goes away, neither of us have had the lesions or the terrible symptoms. We do not take it when we feel symptoms; instead, we take 800mg every day, possibly for the rest of our lives but that's okay so long as we never have to experience another outbreak!!	10	December 5, 2018	20
Acyclovir (Systemic)	Cold Sores	Its no exaggeration that cold sores on my lips has in a way, been ruining my life. It has ended relationships, and I've learned to become ashamed. I had a boyfriend in high school who kissed me with one and now I get them several times a year, and in the winter its back to back. Its horrible.  But this drug is a life saver. I wake up with mine, no tingles. I blast them instantly with 2 at a time ever few hours, and by the end of the night the blisters will cease. What took a week to two weeks to heal now only takes days, sometimes its not even noticeable at all. I now take this everyday to prevent outbreaks. This is a huge relief in my life. I recommend for anyone who suffers like me!	10	November 29, 2018	18
Acyclovir (Systemic)	Herpes Simplex	taking 400mg once a day works for me to prevent outbreaks		October 30, 2018	7
Acyclovir (Systemic)	Cold Sores	I'm a 35 year old female who has suffered from cold sores for so long I have pictures of me as a 3 year old with them, almost every year book picture, me with a cold sore. Every period, stressed, every Holiday. I was prescribed Acyclovir at 33 years old after giving birth to my first child. I had an outbreak and worried about my son catching the virus from me (Herpes is dangerous/deadly for infants) as my mother was so irresponsible when I caught it young. It's amazing, I remember thinking as a small child If given 3 wishes, one would be never get Cold sores again. I'd been on it and hadn't experienced one in almost 2 years. I'm very grateful l I'd never experienced ocular or genital herpes and have great sympathy for those who do. Acyclovir is a miracle for me	10	September 30, 2018	11
Acyclovir (Systemic)	Cold Sores	I use this drug for the occasional cold sore that I get on and/or around my mouth. I live in Mexico and found this drug over the counter. Super sad to hear the cream costs $200 !! Here a 5g tube and 50 tabs of 400 mg tablets cost me a whopping $7 USD. I have a few different tubes so I can have it available if I ever feel a tingle.  And since it’s so cheap if I see even a stranger with a cold sore I offer it to them. It is a miracle worker for me. If I am fortunate enough to catch it in time to take a pill it rarely goes to a full blister. And if it does it is contained to a very slight bump. For me it also relieves any discomfort.	10	September 19, 2018	6
Acyclovir (Systemic)	Herpes Simplex	After trying A LOT of different things Acyclovir is definitely what you need to be taking ASAP. As soon as you feel any tingling at all. If you are unfortunate enough to have reached the weeping sores phase I found the only thing to soothe the pain was salt water with black tea. Pop a tea bag in with hot very salty water and cleanse your intimate area once cool enough. Sounds mad but you'll thank me after!	8	September 5, 2018	15
Acyclovir (Systemic)	Herpes Zoster	I had  herpes zoster in April 2017, was  prescribed   acyclovir 400mg x2  with anti-allergic tabs  for seven days and  was cured  although  after-effects were felt for long.   Interestingly,  I also got rid of another medical condition that had been  bothering me for more than a year prior to the  herpes   attack.  After one year,  symptoms of  old  problem (not herpes) developed again.  I told  doctor about the effect  acyclovir tabs had on it a year ago.  But the doctor laughed away  my observations  and  prescribed  other medicines.  When  I didn't get  relief even after my third visit to her, she reluctantly prescribed acyclovir tabs.  I was completely cured after eight days. Before going public with full details,   I would like to share it with  manufacturers of acyclovir tabs.  They may like to initiate some more research on this wonderful drug and arrive at a definitive conclusion vis-a-vis my observations.    I may  offer myself for  clinical trials, if necessary.	10	August 19, 2018	8
Acyclovir (Systemic)	Zovirax (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	Took one ten day course of this anti-viral over seven years ago and have never had even a hint of another fever blister symptom ever since.   I felt better after first week, and remarkably stronger after completing  the 10 day prescription . Next best thing to a cure.	9	July 9, 2018	15
Acyclovir (Systemic)	Cold Sores	This medication is great! I can't believe it works so fast.. I  will definitely recommend it!	10	May 20, 2018	6
Acyclovir (Systemic)	Herpes Simplex	Great drug .. it’s a shame the cream is so expensive. Tablet for relatively inexpensive. Why is the ointment so expensive?		May 6, 2018	5
Acyclovir (Systemic)	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	My first outbreak was horrific. I could not walk for a week the pain was so unbearable. I laid in bed the whole time with cold packs between my legs and dreaded when having to use the bathroom because the pain was excruciating. I started this medication 4 days after I was infected and had symptoms. It did help and I have been on it for a couple of months now and no side effects. My doctor wants me to be on it for 2 years for suppressive therapy and then try to get off of it. She did inform me however that if I had several outbreaks, she had no problem putting me back on it. She assured me it was safe longterm. There have been times I have forgotten to take my meds and within a few days I have some symptoms, but then I start back up again and in a few days, I am feeling better. This medicine truly allows me to forget that I have HSV-2, other than when I take my meds. It’s been a miracle for me.	10	March 25, 2018	14
Acyclovir (Systemic)	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	I've had fever blisters since I was a child. When I was a teenager I got fever blisters a lot.  As I got older usually just in the summer. About 4 years  ago I was getting them every other month. Dr put me on 400mg twice daily. Have not had any in the last year and a half.  What a difference its made in my life!	10	March 25, 2018	5
Acyclovir (Systemic)	Sitavig (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	Works wonders, but takes a full 24 hours of awkwardly sitting on my gums before dissolving.	8	March 9, 2018	4
Acyclovir (Systemic)	Cold Sores	16 years ago I was accidentally poked in my eye. The following day my eye flared up  very inflamed and painful. I was diagnosed  with viral keratitis (cold sore virus in the eye).  About 5 years later they finally put me on zovirax  tablets 800mg. I found them great. Didn't take long for to clear it up  while also using zovirax  eye ointment  I have had less breakouts over the years compared to the 3 or 4 a year I had been experiencing before be I got prescribed this. These tablets were the answer to my prayers as it's extremely painful when I have an outbreak in my eyes. I currently have an outbreak and my doctor has me on 400mg five times a day as well as  the eye ointment. I've found with this medication the breakouts are less  frequent and the symptoms less severe. Also this  is free for me as it's cover by medical card which is great. No side effects. For me I would highly recommend  zovirax aka adviclor  to anyone  wanting to treat an outbreak	10	February 23, 2018	3
Acyclovir (Systemic)	Herpes Simplex	For the last year I've been plagued with severe cold sore/herpes outbreaks around my lips, chin and nose. A never ending cycle of breakout, heal, breakout. After one day of using the cream and Acyclovir the large bump on the side of my lip flattened to the point of not noticing it. Day six and I haven't seen my face look this clear in years. One little teeny whitehead popped up last night below my lip but you can't tell its a herpes sore.  It kind of seemed like a final whimper. If I could rate prior breakouts as a 10 for worst case scenario, this little guy would be a 1. And I'd even thank someone for it. One last thing, If you're insured look around for community health centers, call them and ask for a low cost pharmacy to fill your prescription. I've read online the same Zovirax cream prescription goes for $200, and Acyclovir anywhere from $80-200. I paid $100 for both. Do some research!	10	February 19, 2018	5
Acyclovir (Systemic)	Cold Sores	Great medicine I've never experienced side effects that I'm aware of and took while pregnant.	10	February 1, 2018	3
Acyclovir (Systemic)	Herpes Simplex	I had HSV-2 in my 20s.  My doctor gave me a strong prescription of Zyclovair and I think it was for 30 days.  I never had an outbreak again.  The outbreak that I was seen for, was my first and only one and it was really quite bad.  Now I am 49 without a herpes outbreak following the treatment.	10	January 16, 2018	32
Acyclovir (Systemic)	Herpes Simplex	I’ve been having cold sores since I was 12 on my lips and face. I tried everything and nothing would work. My doctor prescribed me this when he realized how serious it was. I was getting them sometimes one right after the other one!  I’m supposed to take one gram a day, but I found that when I did that I still got them frequently. So I only take it when I feel a tingle , I take about 4 and it never comes out. What sucks is when I don’t get the tingle and I just wake up with a full blow on sore/sores. Overall medicine really helps though! Completely free with my insurance as well!	7	October 22, 2017	2
Acyclovir (Systemic)	Herpes Simplex	Been taking this medicine for two years with no outbreaks and no side effects. It's been life changing.	10	September 14, 2017	15
Acyclovir (Systemic)	Cold Sores	My experience is that I have had cold sores ONLY on my lips from age 6 to 35. I agreed to a 1st date...bam! I felt it. That is the key; take meds once 1st felt. I have no medical knowledge except I know what my body tolerates and what has been successful which may not be your best bet but be safe careful and consult you Dr b4 any treatment plan.  1. break up your pills in half for immediate absorbtion take 800mg every 2 hours to slam your system to alert it there's an issue and send in a 2nd round of 800 within 1st 4 hours 2. continue 800 for 2 days every 4 hours 3. apply Abreva or similar product on the sore at first sensation, while taking the meds so you are attacking the infection from inside (meds) and externally (creme on sore) 4 days	9	August 23, 2017	8

Acyclovir (Systemic)	Herpes Simplex	I'm 48 and I was diagnosed with genital herpes when I was 35. I started dating a new guy and within 2 weeks I felt horrible burning when I urinated. I went to my midwives and sure enough I had herpes. Funny thing is I wasn't with anyone prior to him and I was with him for 6 years and not once did he ever test positive. They actually claim I could have had it on my face touched it and touched my genitals without washing my hands and transferred it. The outbreaks are less and less over the years but when I feel one coming I take acyclovir 500mg 2x daily. It helps right away. And I use a squirt bottle with warm water as I urinated to help reduce the burning.	10	July 1, 2017	21
Acyclovir (Systemic)	Herpes Simplex	Good day to every one reading this, I am here to give my testimony about a  herbal doctor  called dr tokubo who helped me in my life. I was infected with HERPES SIMPLEX virus in 2015, i went to many hospitals for cure and they told me there was no solution for it, so I was thinking how i can  get a solution so that my body can be okay. One day I was in the river side thinking where I can go to get solution, Along the line a lady walked to me telling me why am I so sad and i open up all to her telling her my problem, she told me that she can help me out, she introduce me to a doctor who uses herbal medication to cure HERPES SIMPLEX virus and gave me his email, so i mail him to order for his herbal medicine.

Acyclovir (Systemic)	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	I have found that acyclovir works better for me when I take pine cone extract. I believe this extract works as an adjuvant, increases the potency of this antiviral drug.  I have been using this combination for several years and have had only two outbreaks in 3 years apposed to 3-4 a year when only using acyclovir 400 mg daily. This makes me believe that the extract is working.  Research suggests that certain compounds found in pine cone extract increases specific Dendritic immune cells.	8	June 1, 2017	14
Acyclovir (Systemic)	Cold Sores	It gave me prostate issues and erection problems. I never had a breakout. The trade off wasn't worth it.		May 17, 2017	1
Acyclovir (Systemic)	Herpes Simplex	I found out I contracted genital herpes from an ex boyfriend about 5 years ago. It initially felt like a cut on my vagina that itched and burned. Went to Dr next day and sure enough- herpes (ugh). I take the medicine as needed and it works like a charm. If I do feel one coming I take 400mg  three day for about 4-5 days. Clears right up. I also used to get cold sore a few times a year- haven't since taking this medicine. It's AMAZING. Just wish I never had to find out about it.	9	April 5, 2017	25
Acyclovir (Systemic)	Herpes Simplex	At 29 weeks pregnant I had a fever. Thought I was leaking amniotic fluid. Went to the hospital and misdiagnosed with a UTI. Stayed overnight with IVF and antibiotics and checked, monitored and ultrasound before discharged the following day. 24 hours later still not having felt well went back to the hospital and rechecked, water broke dilated to 2 and Dr said she didn't think of it before, but was going to test and treat me for Genital Herpes. Right after the emergency c section. 	7	April 4, 2017	5
Acyclovir (Systemic)	Herpes Simplex	About 5 days ago I realized a cut, I thought I had cut myself while shaving... it then got very uncomfortable and burned while I urinated. Finally, I took my camera down there and wanted to look... I noticed a few more cuts  that look like canker sores so I made an appointment right away. She told me it looked like genital herpes. She gave my the cream and the pills. It's only been a day and it doesn't feel like it's working. I know it's soon. But I still feel like I'm on fire, I'm itchy, and it still burns like crazy. Is there anything else I can do?	2	March 29, 2017	17
Acyclovir (Systemic)	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	I have found this drug to be very effective in controlling my IBS/ inflammatory bowel disease.  Clearly it's possible herpes has a role to play in these conditions.	9	March 7, 2017	12
Acyclovir (Systemic)	Herpes Simplex	This is the only thing that works for myself stress induced break outs (college). I use both the pills and the cream. I believe when I first started using acyclovir it was more effective  and now it can take a good 4-5 days to fully heal. This is nothing in comparison to a cold sore that lasted a month without the meds though! 400mg. Free with my healthcare for the pills, the cream was $25.	9	February 22, 2017	8
Acyclovir (Buccal mucosa)	Cold Sores	I have taken acyclovir sporadically for the last two years. My blood cell count was low so I was forced to go off it for a number of months after beginning treatment. I resumed taking it two months ago and I must admit it has been very good. Before beginning acyclovir I had only 1-2 obs but almost constant nerve pain in the anal region. It had been like this (undiagnosed despite numerous doctor's visits) for around 17 years. After acyclovir began and then stopped because of blood cell count, it was however infinitely worse. I had permanent obs and permanent nerve pain in the anal region, and now I had permanent nerve pain in my vaginal area. my doctor originally prescribed me 400mg twice a day but I found I need to take it 3 times a day in order to quell the obs. I am hoping that in another 10-24 months it will be cured but I am suspending my belief as yet.	7	March 13, 2021	0
Acyclovir (Buccal mucosa)	Herpes Simplex	Every few years it occurs, always keep it in reserve because if you are fast enough, a single 800mg can stop it in its tracks, maybe 2 or 3 just to be sure..	10	March 12, 2021	4
Acyclovir (Buccal mucosa)	Herpes Simplex	I found out on Tuesday  that I have herpes went to many doctors before got diagnosed with herpes started itching in 2014 didn't know what it was but can someone give me some advice on how to rid myself of it	3	February 19, 2021	0
Acyclovir (Buccal mucosa)	Herpes Zoster	I took Acyclovir because of shingles, I had to take 800mg 5x a day for 7 days. On the first day I was okay, second day I felt dizzy and a little  nauseous, third day I had severe nausea! Which was horrible! Other symptoms included ....feeling spaced out , stomach cramping , headache , sweating when I was asleep. It’s better to finish the course which I managed to do ! Thank god! However it did clear my rash away	9	December 17, 2020	0
Acyclovir (Buccal mucosa)	Herpes Simplex	My child caught rash on skin. I don’t know where she came in contact with it. We had been on vacations and she was in swimming. It comes back often times every two months. It stays longer when acyclovir is used. I used the cream and the oral liquid and it the outbreak lasted for a long time and it comes back as soon as treatment stops. I’m currently trying essential oils and it clears up faster but I don’t know about the recurrences yet.	1	December 5, 2020	0
Acyclovir (Buccal mucosa)	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	I don't know how I got infected with genital herpes - I was with someone who didn't have it so can only assume it had laid dormant for a number of years when someone else had given it to me. The first outbreak was 10 years ago, but was just an itchy spot in my pubic area close to my panty line. The second outbreak came a month or so later and was just a couple of blisters. When I was diagnosed, my whole world collapsed. I was in therapy for 2 years, it really hit me hard. I've taken acyclovir twice a day since then. I haven't had an outbreak but some days I still get the tingling and ache around my pubic area. On those days, I get very low and upset. I may try a different drug.	8	November 14, 2020	6
Acyclovir (Buccal mucosa)	Herpes Simplex	I think it worked okay within 3 days my breakout was gone. But I don't like that you have to take it 3 times daily for a week straight then keep taking it for prevention if you get breakouts because I forget half the time. It makes me really sick if I don't eat and I have celiac disease so if you can't eat much like I can't this isn't the right kind for you. Because it's not the right one for me and the pill itself is huge looks like a dungeon and dragon symbol	9	October 31, 2020	1
Acyclovir (Buccal mucosa)	Herpes Simplex	I'm 74 years old. First diagnosed 40 years ago so I've been using  Zovirax and acyclovir cream a while. Both have been effective in eliminating or reducing outbreaks. Especially if applied at very first signs of oncoming event. I haven't had a cold sore in that time because I apply the cream when I feel any tingling or raised skin surface. Very little cream is needed to be effective but, several applications a day works best.	10	September 24, 2020	7
Acyclovir (Buccal mucosa)	Sitavig (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	I’ve been getting cold sores once-twice a year for the last 5 years. I do not get a small blister that turns my lip slightly red. When one emerges, it is so large and painful that one entire side of lip is completely swollen. It can be so unsightly and painful for those two weeks that I typically don’t leave the house. I’ve always taken Valtrex as quickly as possible upon feeling symptoms and haven’t found it to be effective. The Sitavig, however, has been a godsend. I applied it upon first notice of a small blister forming. The blister still appeared but is small enough that you can’t really see it unless you know what you’re looking for. There is no swelling and very, very little discomfort (slight itching). I’m only on day 2 of the sore and already it’s shrunk. Highly recommend for anyone who gets large, painful cold sores.	8	September 15, 2020	2
Acyclovir (Buccal mucosa)	Herpes Simplex	I was diagnosed with herpes this year after getting it from my partner. I had a fairly bad first outbreak on my inner labia and just presumed it to be from shaving but I went to a sexual health clinic and got diagnosed. This medicine has been so helpful anytime I have a tingling/throbbing sensation I take it and it works wonders. I’m currently taking it at the moment and the only real side effect I have is having a headache!		July 29, 2020	7
Acyclovir (Buccal mucosa)	Herpes Simplex	I am 43 I just recently got diagnosed with HSV2 with two previous false negative tests. It sucks not 2 know when and where you got the infection from I've never seen any breakouts on any 1 I've been with but I'm seeing you can contract this even with a condom. I have breakouts in more than 1 place inner labial outer labial which I thought was a ingrown hair infection.  Also have a breakout in the anal area but mostly the upper part of the crack which is weird. I hate this. I've been with my bf for 7 yrs he said he had a cold sore before but I don't think he gave it to me by me having 2 false tests. I'm so ashamed as I'd rather have had gonorrhea or chlamydia if I had to suffer from a STD as you can get rid of those. I haven't been able to share this news with my boyfriend as I'm afraid how he may react, he has really tripping about this COVID virus . But I may have had this 4 awhile and luckily I've never transmitted it and this is my first time with an actual blisters.	7	May 22, 2020	18
Acyclovir (Buccal mucosa)	Herpes Simplex	My child came in contact on va cction and has a skin rash HSV-1 and this medicine does not work at all for her.

Acyclovir (Buccal mucosa)	Herpes Simplex	Started taking this after an outbreak. Thought the first one was just irritation from a wax. Realized after that second time it happened that it was definitely herpes and triggered by bikini waxing. Now take this daily to suppress and have not had an outbreak since (over a year). Have found it definitely has caused me to have increased sweating at night, which is annoying, but otherwise no issues.	10	May 11, 2020	7
Acyclovir (Buccal mucosa)	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	I had itching for 3 months before my first HSV-2 lesion appeared. It was very mild but I had the fever, swollen lymph nodes and intense burning. I took Acyclovir for 5 days which reduced my symptoms quickly. I am now on 400mg twice daily for suppression, however I still get the odd itch here and there.	9	April 22, 2020	9
Acyclovir (Buccal mucosa)	Herpes Simplex	I was getting many cold sores every year. I would take Acyclovir as soon as the numbness started. It never shortened the duration; never had any effect on the pain. The cold sores just kept getting worse. The doctor finally put me on a stronger anti-viral. It did nothing either. I only got headaches from the anti-virals. I finally decided to try vitamin D. I haven't had a cold sore in at least 2 years.	1	April 19, 2020	15
Acyclovir (Buccal mucosa)	Herpes Simplex	I was prescribed this meds and it did work, years later I'm still battling with this virus, I never gave it on to anyone, anytime I feel discomfort I call my dr to send a script to the pharmacy. I have had a outbreak on different parts of my vagina and by my anus & mouth. The ones that comes by my vulvar or anus is the worst especially when I urinate I always have that cup of water to pour while I urinate so it wouldn't burn.I'm having an outbreak now I been feeling this itch & painful feeling that got me up. I took a pill about 30 min ago I can honestly tell you Im feeling the med kick in. My pill is 500mg I try to keep some on hands for times like this my dr is close.	10	April 12, 2020	3
Acyclovir (Buccal mucosa)	Herpes Zoster	I have herpes zoster (shingles)in  internal, inner ear. Damage to both trigeminal and occipital nerve. Facial paralysis. This medicine possibly saved my life, and the capsule form worked much better than the tablet form for me. It does give me some side effects such as an upset stomach and a weird energizing feeling (less with capsule for me), but if you truly need the medicine, please take it. This virus, if left untreated, can destroy your health and well-being and possibly kill you. Do not underestimate what it can do to your body.	10	April 2, 2020	9

Acyclovir (Buccal mucosa)	Herpes Simplex	I had back to back outbreaks after 8 years of no outbreaks at all. I take two 400mg tablets of aciclovir a day and I have not had an outbreak since. It has honestly saved my life. I forget I even carry the virus (I told my partner when we got together) and we have unprotected sex and have not passed it on (I have never transmitted to a partner)  TRY THE MEDS THEY WORK.. thank god	10	February 10, 2020	33
Acyclovir (Buccal mucosa)	Herpes Zoster	Discovered I had shingles after reading the Google medical journal lol. Started with mysterious left leg flu like feeling, and excruciating burning pain almost to tears on my left butt cheek. Then bumps on my butt. Decided to take monolaurin (dietary supplement) 3-3x/day for 2 days instead of going to dr. I had no pain and rash was going away. I caved and went to dr to get an Rx of an antiviral so I wouldn’t get post neuralgia. After taking for 2 days I now realize it’s messing with my head. It’s making me feel hopeless and no interest. I am going to discontinue and hope for the best. I will continue with Monolaurin as I think it helped stave off additional outbreaks.	1	February 9, 2020	6
Acyclovir (Buccal mucosa)	Herpes Simplex	I had a rash on my hand that my doctor thought (misdiagnosed) was the shingles. I was prescribed acyclovir and I had a severe allergic reaction. It turns out it was Dyshidrosis (pompholyx) blisters on your hands from stress. Chickenpox/shingles are viral, you do not need to take anything except pain medication. I suffered with hives all over my body the size of dinner plates, it felt like I was being burned alive. I was throwing up, lost weight and my skin/face began to show signs of jaundice. I thought I maybe fatal at one point, my skin began to thin to the point I was seeing the coloration of muscle underneath. I still have scars from it. I had these terrible hives for three months until I was given a steroid shot and montelukast. It was a terrible allergic reaction and this medication is known to cause Steven Johnsons Syndrome (SJS), google it because it is terrifying. The hives were gone in 24 hours after getting steroid shot. Do not take this medication, you could get SJS which can be  the end of your life  or ruin your life.		December 29, 2019	7

Acyclovir (Buccal mucosa)	Herpes Zoster	The acyclovir from Camber Drug Co. and shaped like a stop sign don't work very well. The last ones I had from another company worked just fine.

Acyclovir (Buccal mucosa)	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	First out break of HSV2 at 18,  then  I had NO symptoms at all for 8 YEARS!  Then got back to back out breakouts at 26 years old for 3 months.  Started taking aciclovir 400mg twice a day as suppressive therapy and have had NO symptoms since, for three months.  Side effects minimal.

Acyclovir (Buccal mucosa)	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	I ended up misdiagnosed on several occasions with what felt like a uti and or thrush. After five days of agony and burning fever I knew something was wrong. I had one sore which experts misdiagnosed as a cyst. Finally a GP confirmed my worst fears. An STD in my thirties. I can still count my encounters on one hand but anyone that has sex risk takes the virus and I was just unlucky. I was lucky my partner who was a week into our relationship was so supportive. I take acyclovir as a preventative medication to avoid more breakouts and it works a treat. I get the odd itch but no symtoms. I sometimes feel tired with it and alcohol I have to be careful with. Otherwise I really recommend it for self esteem getting back on your feet and with the whole acceptance aspect. One in six of us have it. This makes it manageable. A vaccine or cure would be better still... But out of all the illnesses and diseases this isn't the worst one.. Count the blessings x	10	August 27, 2019	49
Acyclovir (Buccal mucosa)	Herpes Simplex	I've been using Acyclovir for some time now. Sadly I am noticing that it takes longer to work when I am having an outbreak and I am also noticing outbreaks in different places I never had them before. My hair is beginning to fall out which I was never told was a side affect. I am stressing even more having to deal with those  which is cause more frequent outbreaks.	6	August 19, 2019	13
Acyclovir (Buccal mucosa)	Herpes Simplex	So I am 65 and haven’t had an outbreak for 4 years.    In the past couple of days I’ve had a burning sensation that comes and goes.   It’s in a different place than I’ve ever had it.   There is absolutely nothing to see, no blisters or sore.   But it is so tender I’m lying around with ice on my crotch.  My jeans shorts were painful to the area.    I have the Acyclovir on hand but how do I know if it’s a herpes outbreak.?   It almost feels like it’s bruised.  Again nothing visible.   Is this a giant outbreak waiting to surface?? Is it harmful to take a corse of it “just to be safe?		August 8, 2019	13
Acyclovir (Buccal mucosa)	Herpes Simplex	Stress is NO good for people with HSV2 it activates the virus. I’ve had a rash for about 3 months. Until I got fed up and missed seeing my privates clean and smooth so took a trip to my gyno and she prescribed me acyclovir twice a day and it’s almost clearing up!! On my 5th day of taking the pill.	9	July 28, 2019	15
Acyclovir (Buccal mucosa)	Herpes Simplex	Have had HSV-2 for 15 years. Take the pills on a schedule and try to avoid being stressed because this disease will never go away. Eventually you just get use to having it. Stay positive.		July 5, 2019	28
Acyclovir (Buccal mucosa)	Herpes Simplex	I am a 30 yr old woman and I recently became diagnosed with genital herpes a few days. I started seeing a guy that didn't know he's infected with it. We had sex one of the times without a condom and BOOM here I am. I started having a burning while peeing a few days later, vaginal irritation, stomach cramping ect. I was given a RX for an UTI. 3 days later, I broke out in a few painful little bumps, and the burning in my urination got worse. Then I got a fever. I went to the ER and the doctor diagnosed me genital herpes. Luckily it's a small localized area she said, and gave me Acyclovir  400 MG to take 3x a day. I'm on the 3rd day and it's a huge difference. The site is healing, it's not burning when I urinate, no more fever, and a lot less discharge. I've gotten some side effects of being very drowsy and tired, and tingling random places. The only thing I hate is the drowsiness. I've been fighting to stay awake at work the past 2 days of it really kicking in.	10	June 27, 2019	23
Acyclovir (Buccal mucosa)	Herpes Simplex	I became very irritated down there to the point  it hurt to go to the bathroom I schedule an appointment for the doctor and they told me I had a yeast infection I then noticed bumps down there and they tested for HSV2 (herpes simplex 2) came back positive. Currently day 3 of acyclovir and I am so happy to almost be back to myself. The pain I went through was unbearable... had to call out of work several times because I could barely walk. We will see how this medicine works for me overtime	8	June 10, 2019	18
Acyclovir (Buccal mucosa)	Zovirax (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	I get coldsores mainly in the summer, my symptoms start of with dry and itchy lips, and then they start to blister and swell, I recommend if you have the same symptoms as me then put the Zovirax on as SOON AS POSSIBLE! The cold sore feels much better as soon as it’s on, the healing begins straight away, the blister on the mouth begins to dry out so it may feel uncomfortable, because of this I also use Carmex Lip Balm to keep my lips moisturised. I use Zovirax every time I get a cold sore and they heal much faster, for me it’s max 4 days. Amazing product and definietely worth the money!	10	April 14, 2019	8
Acyclovir (Buccal mucosa)	Herpes Simplex	"Have had HSV2 for 30 years and take Acyclovir 400 mg for episodic outbreaks. In the ""early years"",I used Zovirax ointment, which is very good, but the tablets are betteras you take the medication early, before the dreadful outbreak, in the form of Acyclovir 400mg/2-3x daily for 3-5 days has been an unbelievable blessing. It IS a horrible disease, but Acyclovir makes it bearable."	10	April 8, 2019	13
Acyclovir (Buccal mucosa)	Cold Sores	Summary - If you get a cold sore, use Valacyclovir and Xerese ASAP and don't stop until it is gone!!!    Details - My nose (area between the two nostrils) started getting red Tuesday morning.   I just put Neosporin on it Tuesday night.  I woke up Wed realizing it was a cold sore issue.  I was out of town and didn't have the cold sore meds with me.  I got Valacyclovir filled and immediately starting taking 2 pills in the AM and PM.  I then got Acyclovir cream filled (as Xerese was not available).  I used that cream almost every two hours.  It is very good, but not as optimal as Xerese.  I kept taking both drugs all day Wed and Thursday, even though for Valacyclovir you can stop after 1 day.  I didn't want to chance it.  I got home late Thursday from traveling and swapped out Acyclovir for Xerese.  Results - AMAZING!  All I had was a very tiny scar on Friday afternoon.		March 16, 2019	3
Acyclovir (Buccal mucosa)	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	I was diagnosed with HSV-2 six  months ago. The guy I was seeing had told me before we slept together, and we always used condoms, but it was still transmitted. First outbreak was grim and lasted for about a month, huge blisters on my thighs rendered me unable to walk. I stopped dating for a long time because I couldn't seem to control the outbreaks, and it seemed I was getting them back-to-back every week (although they never came out as full sores, just slight itching and discomfort). I started taking suppressive acyclovir (2 x 400mg per day) after 4 months, and so far the 'outbreaks' have just been itchy with no visible sores. Though I do still get them frequently despite leading a healthy, for the most part stress-free lifestyle. I will continue to take suppressive acyclovir for the foreseeable future to see if my body can eventually adjust to the virus.	7	February 9, 2019	13
Acyclovir (Buccal mucosa)	Herpes Simplex	When using oral and cream at onset gets rid of them fast. But remember this oral stuff  really bad on the liver. If outbreaks are like a few times a year not to worry. If down in Mexico can get for a fraction of the cost then in the states.	10	January 25, 2019	6
Acyclovir (Buccal mucosa)	Sitavig (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	This stuff is amazing! At first it was difficult to apply to gums (it is a tablet you stick on your gums and you don't swallow it). It say sto use round side to apply to gums but I found it easier to use flat side of tablet. If you catch it in time you just get a tiny bump and it goes down by the next day. I haven't had a bad blister in over a year. Use to get them 3 to 4 times a year. Now, maybe 2. If u don't have insurance this medication will be expensive unfortunately.	9	January 19, 2019	2
Acyclovir (Buccal mucosa)	Herpes Simplex	My fiance and I discovered, in the beginning of our relationship, that we both had genital herpes. My first outbreak was the ABSOLUTE worst experience, I was so sick. We suffered for 2 years, had constant breakouts and then finally we decided to both respectively take acyclovir. Doses are 800 mg tablet every day, and honest to goodness it was a miracle drug. We have been on it for 3 months now and except for an occasional itch here and there that lasts for a day and then goes away, neither of us have had the lesions or the terrible symptoms. We do not take it when we feel symptoms; instead, we take 800mg every day, possibly for the rest of our lives but that's okay so long as we never have to experience another outbreak!!	10	December 5, 2018	20
Acyclovir (Buccal mucosa)	Cold Sores	Its no exaggeration that cold sores on my lips has in a way, been ruining my life. It has ended relationships, and I've learned to become ashamed. I had a boyfriend in high school who kissed me with one and now I get them several times a year, and in the winter its back to back. Its horrible.  But this drug is a life saver. I wake up with mine, no tingles. I blast them instantly with 2 at a time ever few hours, and by the end of the night the blisters will cease. What took a week to two weeks to heal now only takes days, sometimes its not even noticeable at all. I now take this everyday to prevent outbreaks. This is a huge relief in my life. I recommend for anyone who suffers like me!	10	November 29, 2018	18
Acyclovir (Buccal mucosa)	Herpes Simplex	taking 400mg once a day works for me to prevent outbreaks		October 30, 2018	7
Acyclovir (Buccal mucosa)	Cold Sores	I'm a 35 year old female who has suffered from cold sores for so long I have pictures of me as a 3 year old with them, almost every year book picture, me with a cold sore. Every period, stressed, every Holiday. I was prescribed Acyclovir at 33 years old after giving birth to my first child. I had an outbreak and worried about my son catching the virus from me (Herpes is dangerous/deadly for infants) as my mother was so irresponsible when I caught it young. It's amazing, I remember thinking as a small child If given 3 wishes, one would be never get Cold sores again. I'd been on it and hadn't experienced one in almost 2 years. I'm very grateful l I'd never experienced ocular or genital herpes and have great sympathy for those who do. Acyclovir is a miracle for me	10	September 30, 2018	11
Acyclovir (Buccal mucosa)	Cold Sores	I use this drug for the occasional cold sore that I get on and/or around my mouth. I live in Mexico and found this drug over the counter. Super sad to hear the cream costs $200 !! Here a 5g tube and 50 tabs of 400 mg tablets cost me a whopping $7 USD. I have a few different tubes so I can have it available if I ever feel a tingle.  And since it’s so cheap if I see even a stranger with a cold sore I offer it to them. It is a miracle worker for me. If I am fortunate enough to catch it in time to take a pill it rarely goes to a full blister. And if it does it is contained to a very slight bump. For me it also relieves any discomfort.	10	September 19, 2018	6
Acyclovir (Buccal mucosa)	Herpes Simplex	After trying A LOT of different things Acyclovir is definitely what you need to be taking ASAP. As soon as you feel any tingling at all. If you are unfortunate enough to have reached the weeping sores phase I found the only thing to soothe the pain was salt water with black tea. Pop a tea bag in with hot very salty water and cleanse your intimate area once cool enough. Sounds mad but you'll thank me after!	8	September 5, 2018	15
Acyclovir (Buccal mucosa)	Herpes Zoster	I had  herpes zoster in April 2017, was  prescribed   acyclovir 400mg x2  with anti-allergic tabs  for seven days and  was cured  although  after-effects were felt for long.   Interestingly,  I also got rid of another medical condition that had been  bothering me for more than a year prior to the  herpes   attack.  After one year,  symptoms of  old  problem (not herpes) developed again.  I told  doctor about the effect  acyclovir tabs had on it a year ago.  But the doctor laughed away  my observations  and  prescribed  other medicines.  When  I didn't get  relief even after my third visit to her, she reluctantly prescribed acyclovir tabs.  I was completely cured after eight days. Before going public with full details,   I would like to share it with  manufacturers of acyclovir tabs.  They may like to initiate some more research on this wonderful drug and arrive at a definitive conclusion vis-a-vis my observations.    I may  offer myself for  clinical trials, if necessary.	10	August 19, 2018	8
Acyclovir (Buccal mucosa)	Zovirax (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	Took one ten day course of this anti-viral over seven years ago and have never had even a hint of another fever blister symptom ever since.   I felt better after first week, and remarkably stronger after completing  the 10 day prescription . Next best thing to a cure.	9	July 9, 2018	15
Acyclovir (Buccal mucosa)	Cold Sores	This medication is great! I can't believe it works so fast.. I  will definitely recommend it!	10	May 20, 2018	6
Acyclovir (Buccal mucosa)	Herpes Simplex	Great drug .. it’s a shame the cream is so expensive. Tablet for relatively inexpensive. Why is the ointment so expensive?		May 6, 2018	5
Acyclovir (Buccal mucosa)	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	My first outbreak was horrific. I could not walk for a week the pain was so unbearable. I laid in bed the whole time with cold packs between my legs and dreaded when having to use the bathroom because the pain was excruciating. I started this medication 4 days after I was infected and had symptoms. It did help and I have been on it for a couple of months now and no side effects. My doctor wants me to be on it for 2 years for suppressive therapy and then try to get off of it. She did inform me however that if I had several outbreaks, she had no problem putting me back on it. She assured me it was safe longterm. There have been times I have forgotten to take my meds and within a few days I have some symptoms, but then I start back up again and in a few days, I am feeling better. This medicine truly allows me to forget that I have HSV-2, other than when I take my meds. It’s been a miracle for me.	10	March 25, 2018	14
Acyclovir (Buccal mucosa)	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	I've had fever blisters since I was a child. When I was a teenager I got fever blisters a lot.  As I got older usually just in the summer. About 4 years  ago I was getting them every other month. Dr put me on 400mg twice daily. Have not had any in the last year and a half.  What a difference its made in my life!	10	March 25, 2018	5

Acyclovir (Buccal mucosa)	Cold Sores	16 years ago I was accidentally poked in my eye. The following day my eye flared up  very inflamed and painful. I was diagnosed  with viral keratitis (cold sore virus in the eye).  About 5 years later they finally put me on zovirax  tablets 800mg. I found them great. Didn't take long for to clear it up  while also using zovirax  eye ointment  I have had less breakouts over the years compared to the 3 or 4 a year I had been experiencing before be I got prescribed this. These tablets were the answer to my prayers as it's extremely painful when I have an outbreak in my eyes. I currently have an outbreak and my doctor has me on 400mg five times a day as well as  the eye ointment. I've found with this medication the breakouts are less  frequent and the symptoms less severe. Also this  is free for me as it's cover by medical card which is great. No side effects. For me I would highly recommend  zovirax aka adviclor  to anyone  wanting to treat an outbreak	10	February 23, 2018	3
Acyclovir (Buccal mucosa)	Herpes Simplex	For the last year I've been plagued with severe cold sore/herpes outbreaks around my lips, chin and nose. A never ending cycle of breakout, heal, breakout. After one day of using the cream and Acyclovir the large bump on the side of my lip flattened to the point of not noticing it. Day six and I haven't seen my face look this clear in years. One little teeny whitehead popped up last night below my lip but you can't tell its a herpes sore.  It kind of seemed like a final whimper. If I could rate prior breakouts as a 10 for worst case scenario, this little guy would be a 1. And I'd even thank someone for it. One last thing, If you're insured look around for community health centers, call them and ask for a low cost pharmacy to fill your prescription. I've read online the same Zovirax cream prescription goes for $200, and Acyclovir anywhere from $80-200. I paid $100 for both. Do some research!	10	February 19, 2018	5
Acyclovir (Buccal mucosa)	Cold Sores	Great medicine I've never experienced side effects that I'm aware of and took while pregnant.	10	February 1, 2018	3
Acyclovir (Buccal mucosa)	Herpes Simplex	I had HSV-2 in my 20s.  My doctor gave me a strong prescription of Zyclovair and I think it was for 30 days.  I never had an outbreak again.  The outbreak that I was seen for, was my first and only one and it was really quite bad.  Now I am 49 without a herpes outbreak following the treatment.	10	January 16, 2018	32
Acyclovir (Buccal mucosa)	Herpes Simplex	I’ve been having cold sores since I was 12 on my lips and face. I tried everything and nothing would work. My doctor prescribed me this when he realized how serious it was. I was getting them sometimes one right after the other one!  I’m supposed to take one gram a day, but I found that when I did that I still got them frequently. So I only take it when I feel a tingle , I take about 4 and it never comes out. What sucks is when I don’t get the tingle and I just wake up with a full blow on sore/sores. Overall medicine really helps though! Completely free with my insurance as well!	7	October 22, 2017	2
Acyclovir (Buccal mucosa)	Herpes Simplex	Been taking this medicine for two years with no outbreaks and no side effects. It's been life changing.	10	September 14, 2017	15
Acyclovir (Buccal mucosa)	Cold Sores	My experience is that I have had cold sores ONLY on my lips from age 6 to 35. I agreed to a 1st date...bam! I felt it. That is the key; take meds once 1st felt. I have no medical knowledge except I know what my body tolerates and what has been successful which may not be your best bet but be safe careful and consult you Dr b4 any treatment plan.  1. break up your pills in half for immediate absorbtion take 800mg every 2 hours to slam your system to alert it there's an issue and send in a 2nd round of 800 within 1st 4 hours 2. continue 800 for 2 days every 4 hours 3. apply Abreva or similar product on the sore at first sensation, while taking the meds so you are attacking the infection from inside (meds) and externally (creme on sore) 4 days	9	August 23, 2017	8

Acyclovir (Buccal mucosa)	Herpes Simplex	I just found out I had HSV. I have itching and burning sensation and the doctor put me on 200 mg daily. Will that be enough?	1	July 27, 2017	11
Acyclovir (Buccal mucosa)	Herpes Simplex	I'm 48 and I was diagnosed with genital herpes when I was 35. I started dating a new guy and within 2 weeks I felt horrible burning when I urinated. I went to my midwives and sure enough I had herpes. Funny thing is I wasn't with anyone prior to him and I was with him for 6 years and not once did he ever test positive. They actually claim I could have had it on my face touched it and touched my genitals without washing my hands and transferred it. The outbreaks are less and less over the years but when I feel one coming I take acyclovir 500mg 2x daily. It helps right away. And I use a squirt bottle with warm water as I urinated to help reduce the burning.	10	July 1, 2017	21
Acyclovir (Buccal mucosa)	Herpes Simplex	Good day to every one reading this, I am here to give my testimony about a  herbal doctor  called dr tokubo who helped me in my life. I was infected with HERPES SIMPLEX virus in 2015, i went to many hospitals for cure and they told me there was no solution for it, so I was thinking how i can  get a solution so that my body can be okay. One day I was in the river side thinking where I can go to get solution, Along the line a lady walked to me telling me why am I so sad and i open up all to her telling her my problem, she told me that she can help me out, she introduce me to a doctor who uses herbal medication to cure HERPES SIMPLEX virus and gave me his email, so i mail him to order for his herbal medicine.

Acyclovir (Buccal mucosa)	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	I have found that acyclovir works better for me when I take pine cone extract. I believe this extract works as an adjuvant, increases the potency of this antiviral drug.  I have been using this combination for several years and have had only two outbreaks in 3 years apposed to 3-4 a year when only using acyclovir 400 mg daily. This makes me believe that the extract is working.  Research suggests that certain compounds found in pine cone extract increases specific Dendritic immune cells.	8	June 1, 2017	14
Acyclovir (Buccal mucosa)	Cold Sores	It gave me prostate issues and erection problems. I never had a breakout. The trade off wasn't worth it.		May 17, 2017	1
Acyclovir (Buccal mucosa)	Herpes Simplex	I found out I contracted genital herpes from an ex boyfriend about 5 years ago. It initially felt like a cut on my vagina that itched and burned. Went to Dr next day and sure enough- herpes (ugh). I take the medicine as needed and it works like a charm. If I do feel one coming I take 400mg  three day for about 4-5 days. Clears right up. I also used to get cold sore a few times a year- haven't since taking this medicine. It's AMAZING. Just wish I never had to find out about it.	9	April 5, 2017	25
Acyclovir (Buccal mucosa)	Herpes Simplex	At 29 weeks pregnant I had a fever. Thought I was leaking amniotic fluid. Went to the hospital and misdiagnosed with a UTI. Stayed overnight with IVF and antibiotics and checked, monitored and ultrasound before discharged the following day. 24 hours later still not having felt well went back to the hospital and rechecked, water broke dilated to 2 and Dr said she didn't think of it before, but was going to test and treat me for Genital Herpes. Right after the emergency c section. 	7	April 4, 2017	5
Acyclovir (Buccal mucosa)	Herpes Simplex	About 5 days ago I realized a cut, I thought I had cut myself while shaving... it then got very uncomfortable and burned while I urinated. Finally, I took my camera down there and wanted to look... I noticed a few more cuts  that look like canker sores so I made an appointment right away. She told me it looked like genital herpes. She gave my the cream and the pills. It's only been a day and it doesn't feel like it's working. I know it's soon. But I still feel like I'm on fire, I'm itchy, and it still burns like crazy. Is there anything else I can do?	2	March 29, 2017	17
Acyclovir (Buccal mucosa)	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	I have found this drug to be very effective in controlling my IBS/ inflammatory bowel disease.  Clearly it's possible herpes has a role to play in these conditions.	9	March 7, 2017	12
Acyclovir (Buccal mucosa)	Herpes Simplex	This is the only thing that works for myself stress induced break outs (college). I use both the pills and the cream. I believe when I first started using acyclovir it was more effective  and now it can take a good 4-5 days to fully heal. This is nothing in comparison to a cold sore that lasted a month without the meds though! 400mg. Free with my healthcare for the pills, the cream was $25.	9	February 22, 2017	8
Acyclovir Capsules	Cold Sores	I have taken acyclovir sporadically for the last two years. My blood cell count was low so I was forced to go off it for a number of months after beginning treatment. I resumed taking it two months ago and I must admit it has been very good. Before beginning acyclovir I had only 1-2 obs but almost constant nerve pain in the anal region. It had been like this (undiagnosed despite numerous doctor's visits) for around 17 years. After acyclovir began and then stopped because of blood cell count, it was however infinitely worse. I had permanent obs and permanent nerve pain in the anal region, and now I had permanent nerve pain in my vaginal area. my doctor originally prescribed me 400mg twice a day but I found I need to take it 3 times a day in order to quell the obs. I am hoping that in another 10-24 months it will be cured but I am suspending my belief as yet.	7	March 13, 2021	0
Acyclovir Capsules	Herpes Simplex	Every few years it occurs, always keep it in reserve because if you are fast enough, a single 800mg can stop it in its tracks, maybe 2 or 3 just to be sure..	10	March 12, 2021	4

Acyclovir Capsules	Herpes Zoster	I took Acyclovir because of shingles, I had to take 800mg 5x a day for 7 days. On the first day I was okay, second day I felt dizzy and a little  nauseous, third day I had severe nausea! Which was horrible! Other symptoms included ....feeling spaced out , stomach cramping , headache , sweating when I was asleep. It’s better to finish the course which I managed to do ! Thank god!

Acyclovir Capsules	Herpes Simplex	My child caught rash on skin. I don’t know where she came in contact with it. We had been on vacations and she was in swimming. It comes back often times every two months. It stays longer when acyclovir is used. I used the cream and the oral liquid and it the outbreak lasted for a long time and it comes back as soon as treatment stops. I’m currently trying essential oils and it clears up faster but I don’t know about the recurrences yet.	1	December 5, 2020	0
Acyclovir Capsules	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	I don't know how I got infected with genital herpes - I was with someone who didn't have it so can only assume it had laid dormant for a number of years when someone else had given it to me. The first outbreak was 10 years ago, but was just an itchy spot in my pubic area close to my panty line. The second outbreak came a month or so later and was just a couple of blisters. When I was diagnosed, my whole world collapsed. I was in therapy for 2 years, it really hit me hard. I've taken acyclovir twice a day since then. I haven't had an outbreak but some days I still get the tingling and ache around my pubic area. On those days, I get very low and upset. I may try a different drug.	8	November 14, 2020	6
Acyclovir Capsules	Herpes Simplex	I think it worked okay within 3 days my breakout was gone. But I don't like that you have to take it 3 times daily for a week straight then keep taking it for prevention if you get breakouts because I forget half the time. It makes me really sick if I don't eat and I have celiac disease so if you can't eat much like I can't this isn't the right kind for you. Because it's not the right one for me and the pill itself is huge looks like a dungeon and dragon symbol	9	October 31, 2020	1
Acyclovir Capsules	Herpes Simplex	I'm 74 years old. First diagnosed 40 years ago so I've been using  Zovirax and acyclovir cream a while. Both have been effective in eliminating or reducing outbreaks. Especially if applied at very first signs of oncoming event. I haven't had a cold sore in that time because I apply the cream when I feel any tingling or raised skin surface. Very little cream is needed to be effective but, several applications a day works best.	10	September 24, 2020	7
Acyclovir Capsules	Sitavig (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	I’ve been getting cold sores once-twice a year for the last 5 years. I do not get a small blister that turns my lip slightly red. When one emerges, it is so large and painful that one entire side of lip is completely swollen. It can be so unsightly and painful for those two weeks that I typically don’t leave the house. I’ve always taken Valtrex as quickly as possible upon feeling symptoms and haven’t found it to be effective. The Sitavig, however, has been a godsend. I applied it upon first notice of a small blister forming. The blister still appeared but is small enough that you can’t really see it unless you know what you’re looking for. There is no swelling and very, very little discomfort (slight itching). I’m only on day 2 of the sore and already it’s shrunk. Highly recommend for anyone who gets large, painful cold sores.	8	September 15, 2020	2
Acyclovir Capsules	Herpes Simplex	I was diagnosed with herpes this year after getting it from my partner. I had a fairly bad first outbreak on my inner labia and just presumed it to be from shaving but I went to a sexual health clinic and got diagnosed. This medicine has been so helpful anytime I have a tingling/throbbing sensation I take it and it works wonders. I’m currently taking it at the moment and the only real side effect I have is having a headache!		July 29, 2020	7
Acyclovir Capsules	Herpes Simplex	I am 43 I just recently got diagnosed with HSV2 with two previous false negative tests. It sucks not 2 know when and where you got the infection from I've never seen any breakouts on any 1 I've been with but I'm seeing you can contract this even with a condom. I have breakouts in more than 1 place inner labial outer labial which I thought was a ingrown hair infection.  Also have a breakout in the anal area but mostly the upper part of the crack which is weird. I hate this. I've been with my bf for 7 yrs he said he had a cold sore before but I don't think he gave it to me by me having 2 false tests. I'm so ashamed as I'd rather have had gonorrhea or chlamydia if I had to suffer from a STD as you can get rid of those. I haven't been able to share this news with my boyfriend as I'm afraid how he may react, he has really tripping about this COVID virus . But I may have had this 4 awhile and luckily I've never transmitted it and this is my first time with an actual blisters.	7	May 22, 2020	18
Acyclovir Capsules	Herpes Simplex	My child came in contact on va cction and has a skin rash HSV-1 and this medicine does not work at all for her.

Acyclovir Capsules	Herpes Simplex	Started taking this after an outbreak. Thought the first one was just irritation from a wax. Realized after that second time it happened that it was definitely herpes and triggered by bikini waxing. Now take this daily to suppress and have not had an outbreak since (over a year). Have found it definitely has caused me to have increased sweating at night, which is annoying, but otherwise no issues.	10	May 11, 2020	7
Acyclovir Capsules	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	I had itching for 3 months before my first HSV-2 lesion appeared. It was very mild but I had the fever, swollen lymph nodes and intense burning. I took Acyclovir for 5 days which reduced my symptoms quickly. I am now on 400mg twice daily for suppression, however I still get the odd itch here and there.	9	April 22, 2020	9
Acyclovir Capsules	Herpes Simplex	I was getting many cold sores every year. I would take Acyclovir as soon as the numbness started. It never shortened the duration; never had any effect on the pain. The cold sores just kept getting worse. The doctor finally put me on a stronger anti-viral. It did nothing either. I only got headaches from the anti-virals. I finally decided to try vitamin D. I haven't had a cold sore in at least 2 years.	1	April 19, 2020	15
Acyclovir Capsules	Herpes Simplex	I was prescribed this meds and it did work, years later I'm still battling with this virus, I never gave it on to anyone, anytime I feel discomfort I call my dr to send a script to the pharmacy. I have had a outbreak on different parts of my vagina and by my anus & mouth. The ones that comes by my vulvar or anus is the worst especially when I urinate I always have that cup of water to pour while I urinate so it wouldn't burn.I'm having an outbreak now I been feeling this itch & painful feeling that got me up. I took a pill about 30 min ago I can honestly tell you Im feeling the med kick in. My pill is 500mg I try to keep some on hands for times like this my dr is close.	10	April 12, 2020	3
Acyclovir Capsules	Herpes Zoster	I have herpes zoster (shingles)in  internal, inner ear. Damage to both trigeminal and occipital nerve. Facial paralysis. This medicine possibly saved my life, and the capsule form worked much better than the tablet form for me. It does give me some side effects such as an upset stomach and a weird energizing feeling (less with capsule for me), but if you truly need the medicine, please take it. This virus, if left untreated, can destroy your health and well-being and possibly kill you. Do not underestimate what it can do to your body.	10	April 2, 2020	9

Acyclovir Capsules	Herpes Simplex	I had back to back outbreaks after 8 years of no outbreaks at all. I take two 400mg tablets of aciclovir a day and I have not had an outbreak since. It has honestly saved my life. I forget I even carry the virus (I told my partner when we got together) and we have unprotected sex and have not passed it on (I have never transmitted to a partner)  TRY THE MEDS THEY WORK.. thank god	10	February 10, 2020	33
Acyclovir Capsules	Herpes Zoster	Discovered I had shingles after reading the Google medical journal lol. Started with mysterious left leg flu like feeling, and excruciating burning pain almost to tears on my left butt cheek. Then bumps on my butt. Decided to take monolaurin (dietary supplement) 3-3x/day for 2 days instead of going to dr. I had no pain and rash was going away. I caved and went to dr to get an Rx of an antiviral so I wouldn’t get post neuralgia. After taking for 2 days I now realize it’s messing with my head. It’s making me feel hopeless and no interest. I am going to discontinue and hope for the best. I will continue with Monolaurin as I think it helped stave off additional outbreaks.	1	February 9, 2020	6
Acyclovir Capsules	Herpes Simplex	I had a rash on my hand that my doctor thought (misdiagnosed) was the shingles. I was prescribed acyclovir and I had a severe allergic reaction. It turns out it was Dyshidrosis (pompholyx) blisters on your hands from stress. Chickenpox/shingles are viral, you do not need to take anything except pain medication. I suffered with hives all over my body the size of dinner plates, it felt like I was being burned alive. I was throwing up, lost weight and my skin/face began to show signs of jaundice. I thought I maybe fatal at one point, my skin began to thin to the point I was seeing the coloration of muscle underneath. I still have scars from it. I had these terrible hives for three months until I was given a steroid shot and montelukast. It was a terrible allergic reaction and this medication is known to cause Steven Johnsons Syndrome (SJS), google it because it is terrifying. The hives were gone in 24 hours after getting steroid shot. Do not take this medication, you could get SJS which can be  the end of your life  or ruin your life.		December 29, 2019	7
Acyclovir Capsules	Varicella-Zoster	Stuff did absolutely nothing to me . Had to rely on painkillers. That little body lotion is only made to give you hope	1	December 26, 2019	0
Acyclovir Capsules	Herpes Zoster	The acyclovir from Camber Drug Co. and shaped like a stop sign don't work very well. The last ones I had from another company worked just fine. But now  I feel like I'm on the start of a big flair. Been taking this stop sign pill shaped pill for 3 weeks. It fails to do what it should do.	3	December 13, 2019	5
Acyclovir Capsules	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	First out break of HSV2 at 18,  then  I had NO symptoms at all for 8 YEARS!  Then got back to back out breakouts at 26 years old for 3 months.  Started taking aciclovir 400mg twice a day as suppressive therapy and have had NO symptoms since, for three months.  Side effects minimal.  My advice is just try it because it has saved me :) x	10	December 10, 2019	16
Acyclovir Capsules	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	I was diagnosed in Jan this year . But I didn’t know I had it I faintly remember years ago having a cut down there that hurt really bad . ( I think that’s when I got infected ) I’ve been on the acyclovir med coming up on year now. I still get outbreaks frequently.. nothing is working I also have PCOS . I have hsv1 & 2 but never had an outbreak on my mouth . I’ll get little bumps on my nose .	3	December 3, 2019	3
Acyclovir Capsules	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	I wasn't told by my sexual partner that they had herpes, I got very ill & was having reproductive problems at the time. I had a few blister type spots and I went to the doctors got acyclovir and it went within 2 days and it's been over a month or 2 now and it hasn't come back.  But he went and continued infecting unsuspecting women.  I'm 21	10	October 12, 2019	11
Acyclovir Capsules	Herpes Simplex	Prescribed for cold sore outbreaks, three 400mg  tabs per day, took for 2 days; my heart is racing, cannot concentrate, blood pressure 157/91, my blood pressure was 120/74 two days prior to using this medication, a general feeling of unwellness, 		August 28, 2019	16
Acyclovir Capsules	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	I ended up misdiagnosed on several occasions with what felt like a uti and or thrush. After five days of agony and burning fever I knew something was wrong. I had one sore which experts misdiagnosed as a cyst. Finally a GP confirmed my worst fears. An STD in my thirties. I can still count my encounters on one hand but anyone that has sex risk takes the virus and I was just unlucky. I was lucky my partner who was a week into our relationship was so supportive. I take acyclovir as a preventative medication to avoid more breakouts and it works a treat. I get the odd itch but no symtoms. I sometimes feel tired with it and alcohol I have to be careful with. Otherwise I really recommend it for self esteem getting back on your feet and with the whole acceptance aspect. One in six of us have it. This makes it manageable. A vaccine or cure would be better still... But out of all the illnesses and diseases this isn't the worst one.. Count the blessings x	10	August 27, 2019	49
Acyclovir Capsules	Herpes Simplex	I've been using Acyclovir for some time now. Sadly I am noticing that it takes longer to work when I am having an outbreak and I am also noticing outbreaks in different places I never had them before. My hair is beginning to fall out which I was never told was a side affect. I am stressing even more having to deal with those  which is cause more frequent outbreaks.	6	August 19, 2019	13
Acyclovir Capsules	Herpes Simplex	So I am 65 and haven’t had an outbreak for 4 years.    In the past couple of days I’ve had a burning sensation that comes and goes.   It’s in a different place than I’ve ever had it.   There is absolutely nothing to see, no blisters or sore.   But it is so tender I’m lying around with ice on my crotch.  My jeans shorts were painful to the area.    I have the Acyclovir on hand but how do I know if it’s a herpes outbreak.?   It almost feels like it’s bruised.  Again nothing visible.   Is this a giant outbreak waiting to surface?? Is it harmful to take a corse of it “just to be safe?		August 8, 2019	13
Acyclovir Capsules	Herpes Simplex	Stress is NO good for people with HSV2 it activates the virus. I’ve had a rash for about 3 months. Until I got fed up and missed seeing my privates clean and smooth so took a trip to my gyno and she prescribed me acyclovir twice a day and it’s almost clearing up!! On my 5th day of taking the pill.	9	July 28, 2019	15
Acyclovir Capsules	Herpes Simplex	Have had HSV-2 for 15 years. Take the pills on a schedule and try to avoid being stressed because this disease will never go away. Eventually you just get use to having it. Stay positive.		July 5, 2019	28
Acyclovir Capsules	Herpes Simplex	I am a 30 yr old woman and I recently became diagnosed with genital herpes a few days. I started seeing a guy that didn't know he's infected with it. We had sex one of the times without a condom and BOOM here I am. I started having a burning while peeing a few days later, vaginal irritation, stomach cramping ect. I was given a RX for an UTI. 3 days later, I broke out in a few painful little bumps, and the burning in my urination got worse. Then I got a fever. I went to the ER and the doctor diagnosed me genital herpes. Luckily it's a small localized area she said, and gave me Acyclovir  400 MG to take 3x a day. I'm on the 3rd day and it's a huge difference. The site is healing, it's not burning when I urinate, no more fever, and a lot less discharge. I've gotten some side effects of being very drowsy and tired, and tingling random places. The only thing I hate is the drowsiness. I've been fighting to stay awake at work the past 2 days of it really kicking in.	10	June 27, 2019	23
Acyclovir Capsules	Herpes Simplex	I became very irritated down there to the point  it hurt to go to the bathroom I schedule an appointment for the doctor and they told me I had a yeast infection I then noticed bumps down there and they tested for HSV2 (herpes simplex 2) came back positive. Currently day 3 of acyclovir and I am so happy to almost be back to myself. The pain I went through was unbearable... had to call out of work several times because I could barely walk. We will see how this medicine works for me overtime	8	June 10, 2019	18
Acyclovir Capsules	Zovirax (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	I get coldsores mainly in the summer, my symptoms start of with dry and itchy lips, and then they start to blister and swell, I recommend if you have the same symptoms as me then put the Zovirax on as SOON AS POSSIBLE! The cold sore feels much better as soon as it’s on, the healing begins straight away, the blister on the mouth begins to dry out so it may feel uncomfortable, because of this I also use Carmex Lip Balm to keep my lips moisturised. I use Zovirax every time I get a cold sore and they heal much faster, for me it’s max 4 days. Amazing product and definietely worth the money!	10	April 14, 2019	8
Acyclovir Capsules	Herpes Simplex	"Have had HSV2 for 30 years and take Acyclovir 400 mg for episodic outbreaks. In the ""early years"",I used Zovirax ointment, which is very good, but the tablets are betteras you take the medication early, before the dreadful outbreak, in the form of Acyclovir 400mg/2-3x daily for 3-5 days has been an unbelievable blessing. It IS a horrible disease, but Acyclovir makes it bearable."	10	April 8, 2019	13
Acyclovir Capsules	Cold Sores	Summary - If you get a cold sore, use Valacyclovir and Xerese ASAP and don't stop until it is gone!!!    Details - My nose (area between the two nostrils) started getting red Tuesday morning.   I just put Neosporin on it Tuesday night.  I woke up Wed realizing it was a cold sore issue.  I was out of town and didn't have the cold sore meds with me.  I got Valacyclovir filled and immediately starting taking 2 pills in the AM and PM.  I then got Acyclovir cream filled (as Xerese was not available).  I used that cream almost every two hours.  It is very good, but not as optimal as Xerese.  I kept taking both drugs all day Wed and Thursday, even though for Valacyclovir you can stop after 1 day.  I didn't want to chance it.  I got home late Thursday from traveling and swapped out Acyclovir for Xerese.  Results - AMAZING!  All I had was a very tiny scar on Friday afternoon.		March 16, 2019	3
Acyclovir Capsules	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	I was diagnosed with HSV-2 six  months ago. The guy I was seeing had told me before we slept together, and we always used condoms, but it was still transmitted. First outbreak was grim and lasted for about a month, huge blisters on my thighs rendered me unable to walk. I stopped dating for a long time because I couldn't seem to control the outbreaks, and it seemed I was getting them back-to-back every week (although they never came out as full sores, just slight itching and discomfort). I started taking suppressive acyclovir (2 x 400mg per day) after 4 months, and so far the 'outbreaks' have just been itchy with no visible sores. Though I do still get them frequently despite leading a healthy, for the most part stress-free lifestyle. I will continue to take suppressive acyclovir for the foreseeable future to see if my body can eventually adjust to the virus.	7	February 9, 2019	13
Acyclovir Capsules	Herpes Simplex	When using oral and cream at onset gets rid of them fast. But remember this oral stuff  really bad on the liver. If outbreaks are like a few times a year not to worry. If down in Mexico can get for a fraction of the cost then in the states.	10	January 25, 2019	6
Acyclovir Capsules	Sitavig (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	This stuff is amazing! At first it was difficult to apply to gums (it is a tablet you stick on your gums and you don't swallow it). It say sto use round side to apply to gums but I found it easier to use flat side of tablet. If you catch it in time you just get a tiny bump and it goes down by the next day. I haven't had a bad blister in over a year. Use to get them 3 to 4 times a year. Now, maybe 2. If u don't have insurance this medication will be expensive unfortunately.	9	January 19, 2019	2
Acyclovir Capsules	Herpes Simplex	My fiance and I discovered, in the beginning of our relationship, that we both had genital herpes. My first outbreak was the ABSOLUTE worst experience, I was so sick. We suffered for 2 years, had constant breakouts and then finally we decided to both respectively take acyclovir. Doses are 800 mg tablet every day, and honest to goodness it was a miracle drug. We have been on it for 3 months now and except for an occasional itch here and there that lasts for a day and then goes away, neither of us have had the lesions or the terrible symptoms. We do not take it when we feel symptoms; instead, we take 800mg every day, possibly for the rest of our lives but that's okay so long as we never have to experience another outbreak!!	10	December 5, 2018	20
Acyclovir Capsules	Cold Sores	Its no exaggeration that cold sores on my lips has in a way, been ruining my life. It has ended relationships, and I've learned to become ashamed. I had a boyfriend in high school who kissed me with one and now I get them several times a year, and in the winter its back to back. Its horrible.  But this drug is a life saver. I wake up with mine, no tingles. I blast them instantly with 2 at a time ever few hours, and by the end of the night the blisters will cease. What took a week to two weeks to heal now only takes days, sometimes its not even noticeable at all. I now take this everyday to prevent outbreaks. This is a huge relief in my life. I recommend for anyone who suffers like me!	10	November 29, 2018	18
Acyclovir Capsules	Herpes Simplex	taking 400mg once a day works for me to prevent outbreaks		October 30, 2018	7
Acyclovir Capsules	Cold Sores	I'm a 35 year old female who has suffered from cold sores for so long I have pictures of me as a 3 year old with them, almost every year book picture, me with a cold sore. Every period, stressed, every Holiday. I was prescribed Acyclovir at 33 years old after giving birth to my first child. I had an outbreak and worried about my son catching the virus from me (Herpes is dangerous/deadly for infants) as my mother was so irresponsible when I caught it young. It's amazing, I remember thinking as a small child If given 3 wishes, one would be never get Cold sores again. I'd been on it and hadn't experienced one in almost 2 years. I'm very grateful l I'd never experienced ocular or genital herpes and have great sympathy for those who do. Acyclovir is a miracle for me	10	September 30, 2018	11
Acyclovir Capsules	Cold Sores	I use this drug for the occasional cold sore that I get on and/or around my mouth. I live in Mexico and found this drug over the counter. Super sad to hear the cream costs $200 !! Here a 5g tube and 50 tabs of 400 mg tablets cost me a whopping $7 USD. I have a few different tubes so I can have it available if I ever feel a tingle.  And since it’s so cheap if I see even a stranger with a cold sore I offer it to them. It is a miracle worker for me. If I am fortunate enough to catch it in time to take a pill it rarely goes to a full blister. And if it does it is contained to a very slight bump. For me it also relieves any discomfort.	10	September 19, 2018	6
Acyclovir Capsules	Herpes Simplex	After trying A LOT of different things Acyclovir is definitely what you need to be taking ASAP. As soon as you feel any tingling at all. If you are unfortunate enough to have reached the weeping sores phase I found the only thing to soothe the pain was salt water with black tea. Pop a tea bag in with hot very salty water and cleanse your intimate area once cool enough. Sounds mad but you'll thank me after!	8	September 5, 2018	15
Acyclovir Capsules	Herpes Zoster	I had  herpes zoster in April 2017, was  prescribed   acyclovir 400mg x2  with anti-allergic tabs  for seven days and  was cured  although  after-effects were felt for long.   Interestingly,  I also got rid of another medical condition that had been  bothering me for more than a year prior to the  herpes   attack.  After one year,  symptoms of  old  problem (not herpes) developed again.  I told  doctor about the effect  acyclovir tabs had on it a year ago.  But the doctor laughed away  my observations  and  prescribed  other medicines.  When  I didn't get  relief even after my third visit to her, she reluctantly prescribed acyclovir tabs.  I was completely cured after eight days. Before going public with full details,   I would like to share it with  manufacturers of acyclovir tabs.  They may like to initiate some more research on this wonderful drug and arrive at a definitive conclusion vis-a-vis my observations.    I may  offer myself for  clinical trials, if necessary.	10	August 19, 2018	8
Acyclovir Capsules	Zovirax (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	Took one ten day course of this anti-viral over seven years ago and have never had even a hint of another fever blister symptom ever since.   I felt better after first week, and remarkably stronger after completing  the 10 day prescription . Next best thing to a cure.	9	July 9, 2018	15

Acyclovir Capsules	Herpes Simplex	Great drug .. it’s a shame the cream is so expensive. Tablet for relatively inexpensive. Why is the ointment so expensive?		May 6, 2018	5
Acyclovir Capsules	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	My first outbreak was horrific. I could not walk for a week the pain was so unbearable. I laid in bed the whole time with cold packs between my legs and dreaded when having to use the bathroom because the pain was excruciating. I started this medication 4 days after I was infected and had symptoms. It did help and I have been on it for a couple of months now and no side effects. My doctor wants me to be on it for 2 years for suppressive therapy and then try to get off of it. She did inform me however that if I had several outbreaks, she had no problem putting me back on it. She assured me it was safe longterm. There have been times I have forgotten to take my meds and within a few days I have some symptoms, but then I start back up again and in a few days, I am feeling better. This medicine truly allows me to forget that I have HSV-2, other than when I take my meds. It’s been a miracle for me.	10	March 25, 2018	14
Acyclovir Capsules	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	I've had fever blisters since I was a child. When I was a teenager I got fever blisters a lot.  As I got older usually just in the summer. About 4 years  ago I was getting them every other month. Dr put me on 400mg twice daily. Have not had any in the last year and a half.  What a difference its made in my life!	10	March 25, 2018	5
Acyclovir Capsules	Sitavig (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	Works wonders, but takes a full 24 hours of awkwardly sitting on my gums before dissolving.	8	March 9, 2018	4
Acyclovir Capsules	Cold Sores	16 years ago I was accidentally poked in my eye. The following day my eye flared up  very inflamed and painful. I was diagnosed  with viral keratitis (cold sore virus in the eye).  About 5 years later they finally put me on zovirax  tablets 800mg. I found them great. Didn't take long for to clear it up  while also using zovirax  eye ointment  I have had less breakouts over the years compared to the 3 or 4 a year I had been experiencing before be I got prescribed this. These tablets were the answer to my prayers as it's extremely painful when I have an outbreak in my eyes. I currently have an outbreak and my doctor has me on 400mg five times a day as well as  the eye ointment. I've found with this medication the breakouts are less  frequent and the symptoms less severe. Also this  is free for me as it's cover by medical card which is great. No side effects. For me I would highly recommend  zovirax aka adviclor  to anyone  wanting to treat an outbreak	10	February 23, 2018	3
Acyclovir Capsules	Herpes Simplex	For the last year I've been plagued with severe cold sore/herpes outbreaks around my lips, chin and nose. A never ending cycle of breakout, heal, breakout. After one day of using the cream and Acyclovir the large bump on the side of my lip flattened to the point of not noticing it. Day six and I haven't seen my face look this clear in years. One little teeny whitehead popped up last night below my lip but you can't tell its a herpes sore.  It kind of seemed like a final whimper. If I could rate prior breakouts as a 10 for worst case scenario, this little guy would be a 1. And I'd even thank someone for it. One last thing, If you're insured look around for community health centers, call them and ask for a low cost pharmacy to fill your prescription. I've read online the same Zovirax cream prescription goes for $200, and Acyclovir anywhere from $80-200. I paid $100 for both. Do some research!	10	February 19, 2018	5
Acyclovir Capsules	Cold Sores	Great medicine I've never experienced side effects that I'm aware of and took while pregnant.	10	February 1, 2018	3
Acyclovir Capsules	Herpes Simplex	I had HSV-2 in my 20s.  My doctor gave me a strong prescription of Zyclovair and I think it was for 30 days.  I never had an outbreak again.  The outbreak that I was seen for, was my first and only one and it was really quite bad.  Now I am 49 without a herpes outbreak following the treatment.	10	January 16, 2018	32
Acyclovir Capsules	Herpes Simplex	I’ve been having cold sores since I was 12 on my lips and face. I tried everything and nothing would work. My doctor prescribed me this when he realized how serious it was. I was getting them sometimes one right after the other one!  I’m supposed to take one gram a day, but I found that when I did that I still got them frequently. So I only take it when I feel a tingle , I take about 4 and it never comes out. What sucks is when I don’t get the tingle and I just wake up with a full blow on sore/sores. Overall medicine really helps though! Completely free with my insurance as well!	7	October 22, 2017	2
Acyclovir Capsules	Herpes Simplex	Been taking this medicine for two years with no outbreaks and no side effects. It's been life changing.	10	September 14, 2017	15
Acyclovir Capsules	Cold Sores	My experience is that I have had cold sores ONLY on my lips from age 6 to 35. I agreed to a 1st date...bam! I felt it. That is the key; take meds once 1st felt. I have no medical knowledge except I know what my body tolerates and what has been successful which may not be your best bet but be safe careful and consult you Dr b4 any treatment plan.  1. break up your pills in half for immediate absorbtion take 800mg every 2 hours to slam your system to alert it there's an issue and send in a 2nd round of 800 within 1st 4 hours 2. continue 800 for 2 days every 4 hours 3. apply Abreva or similar product on the sore at first sensation, while taking the meds so you are attacking the infection from inside (meds) and externally (creme on sore) 4 days	9	August 23, 2017	8

Acyclovir Capsules	Herpes Simplex	I just found out I had HSV. I have itching and burning sensation and the doctor put me on 200 mg daily. Will that be enough?	1	July 27, 2017	11
Acyclovir Capsules	Herpes Simplex	I'm 48 and I was diagnosed with genital herpes when I was 35. I started dating a new guy and within 2 weeks I felt horrible burning when I urinated. I went to my midwives and sure enough I had herpes. Funny thing is I wasn't with anyone prior to him and I was with him for 6 years and not once did he ever test positive. They actually claim I could have had it on my face touched it and touched my genitals without washing my hands and transferred it. The outbreaks are less and less over the years but when I feel one coming I take acyclovir 500mg 2x daily. It helps right away. And I use a squirt bottle with warm water as I urinated to help reduce the burning.	10	July 1, 2017	21
Acyclovir Capsules	Herpes Simplex	Good day to every one reading this, I am here to give my testimony about a  herbal doctor  called dr tokubo who helped me in my life. I was infected with HERPES SIMPLEX virus in 2015, i went to many hospitals for cure and they told me there was no solution for it, so I was thinking how i can  get a solution so that my body can be okay. One day I was in the river side thinking where I can go to get solution, Along the line a lady walked to me telling me why am I so sad and i open up all to her telling her my problem, she told me that she can help me out, she introduce me to a doctor who uses herbal medication to cure HERPES SIMPLEX virus and gave me his email, so i mail him to order for his herbal medicine.

Acyclovir Capsules	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	I have found that acyclovir works better for me when I take pine cone extract. I believe this extract works as an adjuvant, increases the potency of this antiviral drug.  I have been using this combination for several years and have had only two outbreaks in 3 years apposed to 3-4 a year when only using acyclovir 400 mg daily. This makes me believe that the extract is working.  Research suggests that certain compounds found in pine cone extract increases specific Dendritic immune cells.	8	June 1, 2017	14
Acyclovir Capsules	Cold Sores	It gave me prostate issues and erection problems. I never had a breakout. The trade off wasn't worth it.		May 17, 2017	1
Acyclovir Capsules	Herpes Simplex	I found out I contracted genital herpes from an ex boyfriend about 5 years ago. It initially felt like a cut on my vagina that itched and burned. Went to Dr next day and sure enough- herpes (ugh). I take the medicine as needed and it works like a charm. If I do feel one coming I take 400mg  three day for about 4-5 days. Clears right up. I also used to get cold sore a few times a year- haven't since taking this medicine. It's AMAZING. Just wish I never had to find out about it.	9	April 5, 2017	25
Acyclovir Capsules	Herpes Simplex	At 29 weeks pregnant I had a fever. Thought I was leaking amniotic fluid. Went to the hospital and misdiagnosed with a UTI. Stayed overnight with IVF and antibiotics and checked, monitored and ultrasound before discharged the following day. 24 hours later still not having felt well went back to the hospital and rechecked, water broke dilated to 2 and Dr said she didn't think of it before, but was going to test and treat me for Genital Herpes. Right after the emergency c section. 	7	April 4, 2017	5
Acyclovir Capsules	Herpes Simplex	About 5 days ago I realized a cut, I thought I had cut myself while shaving... it then got very uncomfortable and burned while I urinated. Finally, I took my camera down there and wanted to look... I noticed a few more cuts  that look like canker sores so I made an appointment right away. She told me it looked like genital herpes. She gave my the cream and the pills. It's only been a day and it doesn't feel like it's working. I know it's soon. But I still feel like I'm on fire, I'm itchy, and it still burns like crazy. Is there anything else I can do?	2	March 29, 2017	17
Acyclovir Capsules	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	I have found this drug to be very effective in controlling my IBS/ inflammatory bowel disease.  Clearly it's possible herpes has a role to play in these conditions.	9	March 7, 2017	12
Acyclovir Capsules	Herpes Simplex	This is the only thing that works for myself stress induced break outs (college). I use both the pills and the cream. I believe when I first started using acyclovir it was more effective  and now it can take a good 4-5 days to fully heal. This is nothing in comparison to a cold sore that lasted a month without the meds though! 400mg. Free with my healthcare for the pills, the cream was $25.	9	February 22, 2017	8
Acyclovir Cream	Zovirax Cream (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	Zovirax burnt my skin around the cold sore leaving a red mark 2-3 times larger than my cold sore! It also caused this skin to peel. My cold sore is essentially gone after approximately 6 days but now I am left with a very obvious and huge red mark. If you use this cream and it stings or burns at all when you apply it I would suggest stopping usage straight away. It says that this may be a “mild” symptom of using the cream. I wish I had stopped using it as soon as I felt the stinging sensation.	2	April 20, 2021	0
Acyclovir Cream	Zovirax Cream (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	I'm from the UK, and have had cold sores all my life (40s)  Zovirax is a complete waste of money.  For years I used it because I believed the marketing - and i thought that cold sores just got bigger, but about 5 years ago I tried just leaving well alone.  Without Zovirax, they crust faster, don't spread and heal faster and more naturally.  With Zovirax, I find it burns the skin, they spread (keep popping up outside the original zone) and scar for longer.   I've also not really found that Zovirax prevents them if you get there during the original tingling either.  Also - the tube size is a scandal.	1	February 16, 2021	4
Acyclovir Cream	Herpes Simplex	I 100% recommend this acyclovir prescription/treatment to anyone suffering from herpes! I was diagnosed we with herpes simplex 1, and have used abreva, valtrex, and have tried random sworn by home remedies. Abreva after by maybe day 7 started to work, valtrex after close to a week began to work, the home remedies did not work at all!!! All in all, the effectiveness of what I've tried prior to acyclovir did not impress me as much as this prescription has. I was a day into my outbreak, my lip was already swollen and bubbled. That one day in I started the cream and the next day , it had gone down 80%. It was already scabbed over and no longer pulsating! This has definitely been a blessing to me, as I am very skeptical at times when it comes to medications that says to be close to 100% effective!	10	February 2, 2021	3
Acyclovir Cream	Zovirax Cream (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	Not so much the effect but the affect of opening this packaging? I could not believe my eyes the size of 2g tube? Absolutely shocking to say the least & for £5. Once I pierced it open I could then turn the tube at least 3 times before the cream appeared. I'm sure this is a great product? But will there be enough to get rid of my problem?	5	January 22, 2021	1
Acyclovir Cream	Zovirax Cream (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	Would highly recommend giving this a go. Was diagnosed with HSV1 cold sores last year and this has by far been my best experience. Had a cold sore first appear yesterday and has pretty much already cleared up after using this Zovirax Duo a few times over the course of 24 hours. Love this stuff!	10	October 14, 2020	2
Acyclovir Cream	Cold Sores	Everyone is saying how expensive it is $250 etc, why don't you buy a uk version and have it delivered to USA, here in uk online you can buy Zovirax (active ingredient 5% acyclovir) for like £5.00 which will be like $7.50	10	August 19, 2020	1
Acyclovir Cream	Herpes Simplex	"I have had cold sore outbreaks around my mouth since my childhood. I have tried absolutely everything (i.e. : Lipactin, Abreva and so on) and the only topical treatment I've found to be effective is acyclovir cream 5% (I buy generics). If applied early in the onset, sores typically remain small and will dry within a day or two. Before switching to acyclovir cream, an outbreak would last from 4 to 7 days. Now, 2 to 4 days is the usual. It feels like you are skipping the nasty and uncomfortable phase right after the outbreak to go straight to the ""recovery"" phase where the skin is healing under the dried scabs. I always carry some with me now."	9	August 12, 2020	6
Acyclovir Cream	Zovirax Cream (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	Okay so I always had cold sores all my life, one advise, don't use zovirex. It spreads and it leaves a nasty scar which takes ages to heal. Use ordinary Vaseline to keep it moist but only apply small amount, too much moisture can also create the cold sore to worsen. Aqueous worked for me.		June 24, 2020	1
Acyclovir Cream	Zovirax Cream (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	I love zovirax, I prefer the pump tube to the metal tube as I feel it's more hygienic. However I have recently been trying Zovirax Duo which is a few dollars more than the regular cream, but it's amazing. The day after noticing a cold sore, the swelling is already very reduced and scabbing forms. I find the coldsore heals so much faster with the Duo cream	10	May 6, 2020	1
Acyclovir Cream	Herpes Simplex	I was prescribed Acyclovir cream for face shingle treatment however I have no cold sores. I am in the scabbing phase.  My dermatologist was negligent to tell me that the tiny tube would cost $230.  This medication seems more designed for intense cold sores.  Not sure its worth a damn if I don't have cold sores and not sure I am willing to spend $230 to see if it helps my scabs lighten.  I don't hold dermatologists in high regard and now a bit less.	1	May 5, 2020	1
Acyclovir Cream	Zovirax Cream (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	The worst stuff I have ever used. It burnt and scarred my skin. The cold sore was almost invisible, and Zovirax burnt it and thee surrounding skin. It made it look awful, and made it painful, and took three weeks to heal. NEVER AGAIN,  Beware!	1	March 30, 2020	7
Acyclovir Cream	Zovirax Cream (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	It works for me. No doubt about it. But in Canada I had to pay $80 for a tiny tube. Then, 2/3 of the tube was air. So thanks for that.	10	December 24, 2019	6
Acyclovir Cream	Zovirax Ointment (acyclovir) for Herpes Simplex	There is some confusion about the cream vs. the ointment.  Chemically, acyclovir is acyclovir.  The only difference between the two is only the 'CARRIER' - cream vs ointment.  The ointment (for genital herpes in U.S.) has polyethylene glycol, a very slippery compound used as in laxatives and for bowel prep.  It has many other medical and industrial uses. Considering the small amount possibly ingested when applying to the mouth, the only reason not to use the cheaper ointment is if you are sensitive to polyethylene glycol.   The cream (oral herpes/cold sores) contains  mineral oil, (also a laxative) poloxamer 407, propylene glycol, sodium lauryl sulfate, water, and white petrolatum.  Proplylene glycol is supposedly good for skin, stops flaking, etc.   Despite hours of research I can't find why cream is so expensive unless maker thinks we'll pay more for a treatment for our face vs genitals. The CREAM is the one that is SO OUTRAGEOUSLY EXPENSIVE!!	10	December 19, 2019	9
Acyclovir Cream	Zovirax Cream (acyclovir) for Herpes Simplex	I have had a spot come up twice in 14 years on my index finger.   Index finger on right hand, infected when worked as a dental assistant on patients.  This time they prescribed this cream and I noticed a great change. You never know what you're exposed to in the medical/ dental field. Gloves still tear. But luckily they are Meds to help. This product has lessened the swelling and throbbing.	7	December 14, 2019	5
Acyclovir Cream	Zovirax Cream (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	I'm also from the UK and like most of the comments from the UK, the cream does not help. Again bought some and it seems to make it spread. I'm sure if I didn't use it it would not be as bad as it is this morning. Maybe there IS a difference between US and UK . I must remind myself not to bother with this again.... try something else... pity	1	December 5, 2019	9
Acyclovir Cream	Cold Sores	I was prescribed Acyclovir Ointment 5%.  First of all, the tube was tiny and cost me $113.00.  Secondly, this cream did not work on my cold sore.  I followed the instructions and used it every 3 hours.  I am on day 8 of 10 and my cold sore is still there and does not look like it is healing.  Don't waste your money.  Use Abreva instead.	1	December 1, 2019	0
Acyclovir Cream	Cold Sores	This is by far the best cold sore ingredient. The ointment+pills have worked wonders for me. I am never the person to leave reviews, but needed too for someone like you out there who's looking for a cure to Cold Sores. *ACYCLOVIR IS THE BEST*	10	September 25, 2019	2

Acyclovir Cream	Zovirax Cream (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	You can buy this off the shelf in the UK, at any pharmacy and many supermarkets, for around £5 for a 2g pump. Worth stocking up if you're visiting from the US!!	10	July 4, 2019	8
Acyclovir Cream	Zovirax Cream (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	Way better than abreva! 1 to 2 days max and it is gone.	10	December 28, 2018	11
Acyclovir Cream	Zovirax Cream (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	Zorvirax duo honestly works wonders! As soon as I feel the tingling I lather it on and it’s gone the next day! There are also tablets that you can take but they only work if the cold sore hasn’t appeared yet and you’re only getting the tingling sensation. Just ask for them at your chemist. They’re 3 pills and you take them all at once and the cold sore doesn’t even come up. I got my lips done and I got a cold sore the next day used the cream and it was gone. I went to get them done a second time and took the tablets as a precaution and no cold sore even appeared! Love love love the cream!		December 10, 2018	8
Acyclovir Cream	Zovirax Cream (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	I love Zovirax in the little pump. Clears up cold sores in 3 days. However I’ve noticed the amount of cream in the pump has become less. Disappointing.	8	December 10, 2018	8
Acyclovir Cream	Cold Sores	Works every time if you get it at the first signs of a cold sore.  For US cold sore sufferers can who make it to Mexico, you can get it over the counter under a generic brand  for 65 pesos at any supermarket with a pharmacy - that is about $3 USD.	10	August 11, 2018	3
Acyclovir Cream	Zovirax Cream (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	The cold sores usually don't even appear if I apply the cream at the first signs of tingling. Once, I failed to catch the tingly symptoms at the start, and only realised when my lips began to harden and split. I rushed to the pharmacy to purchase Zovirax, and I managed to dodge the embarrassing process of allowing the cold sore to fully blister and crust. I bet no one even suspected I had cold sores.  I don't know why everyone is comparing prices here, but it costs approximately USD $15 for a 2g tube where I come from. Just apply a little will do, I'm not sure why someone mentioned finishing the 2g tube within 3 days. It can last me two years, before it expires. Read the directions that it comes with.	10	July 19, 2018	7
Acyclovir Cream	Zovirax Cream (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	Had a wedding and got a cold sore 3 says prior. Used the cream every half hour till the day. Totally disappeared. Couldn't even see them in the photos. Highly recommend to everyone.	10	June 22, 2018	13
Acyclovir Cream	Zovirax Cream (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	This stuff is amazing does not burn, it heals the pain & cold sore		June 15, 2018	7
Acyclovir Cream	Cold Sores	The best medicine for cold sores! I apply it as much as possible throughout the day and have never had a blister since using it. Would recommend it to everyone.	10	May 3, 2018	2
Acyclovir Cream	Zovirax Cream (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	I just want to mention that in my country zovirax costs something like 10$ 10g! I cannot believe how expensive is in US. Thats insane	10	March 13, 2018	6
Acyclovir Cream	Zovirax Cream (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	Zovirax cream is amazing.  I hardly ever get an actual cold sore anymore, because I apply the cream as soon as I feel any tingle and it prevents the outbreak. Well, 3 days ago, I missed the tingle because I had a huge pimple forming on my chin, just under my lip, and it was so painful that it masked the tingle on my lip.  By the time I woke up & realized what was happening, my lip had already swollen quite badly.  I was horrified & thought the battle was already lost, but I immediately started applying Zovirax.  My lip still swelled up to 3 times its size over the next 36 hours, but then it started to recede and never even blistered!  It is now 3 days after it started & my lip is almost back to normal.  I cannot believe it worked when the cold sore had already taken hold, and stopped the blisters from erupting.  I love this stuff so much!  It cost about $80 for a 5g tube the last time I bought it, but it lasts a long time for me.  I always carry it in my purse so I am armed for battle.	10	March 2, 2018	8
Acyclovir Cream	Zovirax Cream (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	Zovirax works great on cold sores. I use at first sign for a few days and it doesn't even blister. If I get a blister it doesn't get big and dries up 2  to 3 days. Abreva never worked for me. This stuff is great	10	February 22, 2018	5
Acyclovir Cream	Zovirax Cream (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	Zovirax does work. The trick is to apply small amounts as soon as possible and as often as possible. The more times you apply the more chances you have of healing quicker. Applying 3 x a day just aint going to cut it. (Every hour or less if you have to)		February 17, 2018	7
Acyclovir Cream	Herpes Simplex	I use the generic brand by Mylan. This product is amazing. Even if you have a bad outbreak it cuts the healing time by a few days. That may seem minimal to some, but those who suffer from cold sores, this is superb. If you apply it during the first signs you will not even have an outbreak.	10	January 4, 2018	5
Acyclovir Cream	Zovirax Cream (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	OMG LOL  extremely ridiculous how Zovirax cream expensive in USA  $700 plus!  Zovirax cream It costs in other countries  less than $20.00   It's very sad how they take  advantage of people here in USA.  Less than $20. Lol same Zovirax cream. Have mercy on people and stop using them like this!		December 16, 2017	6
Acyclovir Cream	Herpes Simplex	I was diagnosed with genital herpes earlier today, though the symptoms began a month ago and I mistaken it for a yeast infection. The sores started last Monday (5 days ago).  The burning was so bad to the point where I had trouble walking. After applying acyclovir earlier I experienced moderate burning for a short amount of time but after sitting down for awhile I felt relief. let's hope that tomorrow the sores aren't as painful	7	November 26, 2017	9
Acyclovir Cream	Zovirax Cream (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	My son had a cold sores out break, got a Zovirax cream as treatment. It works well but the cream ran out before cold sore. I paid $14 for a tube 2g of Zovirax, the amount of cream not even cover 3 days treatment. The tube with a size of lips sunscreen but the amount of cream inside is ridiculously tiny. Such a ripoff, please consider low income consumer with your products.	7	October 10, 2017	3
Acyclovir Cream	Zovirax Cream (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	Zovirax cream has 50mg of acyclovir in it -doesn't it? It was in the contents ingredients information list. Zovirax cream is a MIRACLE CURE!! Coldsores  -dab it on asap a small tiny bit -Bumps on skin like welts or hives (Shingles?) +very painful +scary looking like chicken pox -connect the bumps/dots.  It's stress+anxiety like someone else said...lack of sleep+you haven't been eating since the ?other? day+working extra daysTHENnights+ little catnap sleeps+ you find junk sugar loaded snacks +even the fruit+applesauce cups+granola =huge sugar/salt +sugar drinks+ creamy sugar coffee day+night to just get through those sudden double shifts =Reactions- cold sores +hive like sores+ACNE!

Acyclovir Cream	Zovirax Cream (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	I am 21 years old and just suffered from my first major breakout of cold sores in my life. It was pretty bad and I was frustrated from the unsightly sores appearing on my lips and mouth. I also had an outbreak just below my eye in the sensitive skin. I went to the doctor and she prescribed me with the Zovirax cream and I saw a lessened appearance in worst of the cold sores on my lip in less than 24 hours. While it takes time for them to heal, I definitely think this is a worthwhile drug. It cost me $45 so its not super cheap, but it really alleviated some of my symptoms. I had another cold sore forming on my lip just below the bad one and it stopped that one dead in its tracks and I already see it healing and not blistering. Worth it!	10	May 8, 2017	1
Acyclovir Cream	Cold Sores	You are going to love this, my small tube of aciclovir ointment costs $900.  Welcome to 'Merica.  Luckily my insurance covered it or I would have lots of cold sores.  The stuff is marginally effective if you catch the cold sores at the right moment.  I am switching over to oral hoping for better results.  	4	April 10, 2017	0
Acyclovir Cream	Zovirax Ointment (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	COLD SORE TREATMENTS AND PREVENTION THAT WORK: L-lysine: You can buy L-lysine over the counter in tablet form, one a day pretty much prevents cold sores from forming.  If you run out of tablets make sure you buy more; it's like the virus sits inactive under the skin just waiting for a break from the L-lysine treatment so it can raise it's ugly head.  ZOVIRAX: If you feel a cold sore coming on or you have a cold sore buy Zovirax from the chemist or supermarket ~$17 a tube; but you only need a little bit applied 5 or 6 times a day and the last application should be before you go to sleep (whenever you think of applying it really) Zovirax helps heal the blisters much faster than anything else l have tried. ICE OR COLD PACK: If you don't have Zovirax and the cold sore is really burning and itchy get a freezer bag or similar and put some ice in it or some frozen peas and apply that to the area until that nasty burning and itchy feeling eases. Avoid licking of playing with the blisters with your tongue, this tends to make them bigger. Pop the Blisters or Don't Pop the Blisters? This is a personal preference however,  l have found that by not popping the blisters only allows the blisters to grow bigger to the point of them sometimes joining together and becoming one big blister which takes a lot longer to heal, hence, l pop the blister and apply Zovirax straight away and the majority are gone within a few days. SAFETY FIRST: DO NOT have oral sex and AVOID kissing anyone when you have an active cold sore; they do spread as quickly as a peck on the lips from someone with the active cold sore virus and wash your hands if you touch your mouth by accident, this helps prevent spreading the cold sore virus. PREVENTION: Take L-lysine 1 tablet daily and try to avoid sudden drops in temperature, excessive sun or wind. Changes in climate conditions and temperature drops can bring on the cold sore virus. Avoid rubbing your lips hard like we sometimes do to remove stubborn lipstick and avoid the hard bristles of a man's beard or regrowth, both of these things can irritate the sensitive skin on our lips. Just be mindful of the cold sore virus and it will become second nature to prevent it from occurring.	10	March 20, 2017	19
Acyclovir IV Infusion	Cold Sores	I have taken acyclovir sporadically for the last two years. My blood cell count was low so I was forced to go off it for a number of months after beginning treatment. I resumed taking it two months ago and I must admit it has been very good. Before beginning acyclovir I had only 1-2 obs but almost constant nerve pain in the anal region. It had been like this (undiagnosed despite numerous doctor's visits) for around 17 years. After acyclovir began and then stopped because of blood cell count, it was however infinitely worse. I had permanent obs and permanent nerve pain in the anal region, and now I had permanent nerve pain in my vaginal area. my doctor originally prescribed me 400mg twice a day but I found I need to take it 3 times a day in order to quell the obs. I am hoping that in another 10-24 months it will be cured but I am suspending my belief as yet.	7	March 13, 2021	0
Acyclovir IV Infusion	Herpes Simplex	Every few years it occurs, always keep it in reserve because if you are fast enough, a single 800mg can stop it in its tracks, maybe 2 or 3 just to be sure..	10	March 12, 2021	4
Acyclovir IV Infusion	Herpes Simplex	I found out on Tuesday  that I have herpes went to many doctors before got diagnosed with herpes started itching in 2014 didn't know what it was but can someone give me some advice on how to rid myself of it	3	February 19, 2021	0
Acyclovir IV Infusion	Herpes Zoster	I took Acyclovir because of shingles, I had to take 800mg 5x a day for 7 days. On the first day I was okay, second day I felt dizzy and a little  nauseous, third day I had severe nausea! Which was horrible! Other symptoms included ....feeling spaced out , stomach cramping , headache , sweating when I was asleep. It’s better to finish the course which I managed to do ! Thank god! However it did clear my rash away	9	December 17, 2020	0
Acyclovir IV Infusion	Herpes Simplex	My child caught rash on skin. I don’t know where she came in contact with it. We had been on vacations and she was in swimming. It comes back often times every two months. It stays longer when acyclovir is used. I used the cream and the oral liquid and it the outbreak lasted for a long time and it comes back as soon as treatment stops. I’m currently trying essential oils and it clears up faster but I don’t know about the recurrences yet.	1	December 5, 2020	0
Acyclovir IV Infusion	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	I don't know how I got infected with genital herpes - I was with someone who didn't have it so can only assume it had laid dormant for a number of years when someone else had given it to me. The first outbreak was 10 years ago, but was just an itchy spot in my pubic area close to my panty line. The second outbreak came a month or so later and was just a couple of blisters. When I was diagnosed, my whole world collapsed. I was in therapy for 2 years, it really hit me hard. I've taken acyclovir twice a day since then. I haven't had an outbreak but some days I still get the tingling and ache around my pubic area. On those days, I get very low and upset. I may try a different drug.	8	November 14, 2020	6
Acyclovir IV Infusion	Herpes Simplex	I think it worked okay within 3 days my breakout was gone. But I don't like that you have to take it 3 times daily for a week straight then keep taking it for prevention if you get breakouts because I forget half the time. It makes me really sick if I don't eat and I have celiac disease so if you can't eat much like I can't this isn't the right kind for you. Because it's not the right one for me and the pill itself is huge looks like a dungeon and dragon symbol	9	October 31, 2020	1
Acyclovir IV Infusion	Herpes Simplex	I'm 74 years old. First diagnosed 40 years ago so I've been using  Zovirax and acyclovir cream a while. Both have been effective in eliminating or reducing outbreaks. Especially if applied at very first signs of oncoming event. I haven't had a cold sore in that time because I apply the cream when I feel any tingling or raised skin surface. Very little cream is needed to be effective but, several applications a day works best.	10	September 24, 2020	7
Acyclovir IV Infusion	Sitavig (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	I’ve been getting cold sores once-twice a year for the last 5 years. I do not get a small blister that turns my lip slightly red. When one emerges, it is so large and painful that one entire side of lip is completely swollen. It can be so unsightly and painful for those two weeks that I typically don’t leave the house. I’ve always taken Valtrex as quickly as possible upon feeling symptoms and haven’t found it to be effective. The Sitavig, however, has been a godsend. I applied it upon first notice of a small blister forming. The blister still appeared but is small enough that you can’t really see it unless you know what you’re looking for. There is no swelling and very, very little discomfort (slight itching). I’m only on day 2 of the sore and already it’s shrunk. Highly recommend for anyone who gets large, painful cold sores.	8	September 15, 2020	2
Acyclovir IV Infusion	Herpes Simplex	I was diagnosed with herpes this year after getting it from my partner. I had a fairly bad first outbreak on my inner labia and just presumed it to be from shaving but I went to a sexual health clinic and got diagnosed. This medicine has been so helpful anytime I have a tingling/throbbing sensation I take it and it works wonders. I’m currently taking it at the moment and the only real side effect I have is having a headache!		July 29, 2020	7
Acyclovir IV Infusion	Herpes Simplex	I am 43 I just recently got diagnosed with HSV2 with two previous false negative tests. It sucks not 2 know when and where you got the infection from I've never seen any breakouts on any 1 I've been with but I'm seeing you can contract this even with a condom. I have breakouts in more than 1 place inner labial outer labial which I thought was a ingrown hair infection.  Also have a breakout in the anal area but mostly the upper part of the crack which is weird. I hate this. I've been with my bf for 7 yrs he said he had a cold sore before but I don't think he gave it to me by me having 2 false tests. I'm so ashamed as I'd rather have had gonorrhea or chlamydia if I had to suffer from a STD as you can get rid of those. I haven't been able to share this news with my boyfriend as I'm afraid how he may react, he has really tripping about this COVID virus . But I may have had this 4 awhile and luckily I've never transmitted it and this is my first time with an actual blisters.	7	May 22, 2020	18
Acyclovir IV Infusion	Herpes Simplex	My child came in contact on va cction and has a skin rash HSV-1 and this medicine does not work at all for her. I hate to see her so irritated I wish there was an actual cure. I used vinegar and coconut oils and it took just as long to clear as this drug..	1	May 20, 2020	2
Acyclovir IV Infusion	Herpes Simplex	Started taking this after an outbreak. Thought the first one was just irritation from a wax. Realized after that second time it happened that it was definitely herpes and triggered by bikini waxing. Now take this daily to suppress and have not had an outbreak since (over a year). Have found it definitely has caused me to have increased sweating at night, which is annoying, but otherwise no issues.	10	May 11, 2020	7
Acyclovir IV Infusion	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	I had itching for 3 months before my first HSV-2 lesion appeared. It was very mild but I had the fever, swollen lymph nodes and intense burning. I took Acyclovir for 5 days which reduced my symptoms quickly. I am now on 400mg twice daily for suppression, however I still get the odd itch here and there.	9	April 22, 2020	9
Acyclovir IV Infusion	Herpes Simplex	I was getting many cold sores every year. I would take Acyclovir as soon as the numbness started. It never shortened the duration; never had any effect on the pain. The cold sores just kept getting worse. The doctor finally put me on a stronger anti-viral. It did nothing either. I only got headaches from the anti-virals. I finally decided to try vitamin D. I haven't had a cold sore in at least 2 years.	1	April 19, 2020	15
Acyclovir IV Infusion	Herpes Simplex	I was prescribed this meds and it did work, years later I'm still battling with this virus, I never gave it on to anyone, anytime I feel discomfort I call my dr to send a script to the pharmacy. I have had a outbreak on different parts of my vagina and by my anus & mouth. The ones that comes by my vulvar or anus is the worst especially when I urinate I always have that cup of water to pour while I urinate so it wouldn't burn.I'm having an outbreak now I been feeling this itch & painful feeling that got me up. I took a pill about 30 min ago I can honestly tell you Im feeling the med kick in. My pill is 500mg I try to keep some on hands for times like this my dr is close.	10	April 12, 2020	3
Acyclovir IV Infusion	Herpes Zoster	I have herpes zoster (shingles)in  internal, inner ear. Damage to both trigeminal and occipital nerve. Facial paralysis. This medicine possibly saved my life, and the capsule form worked much better than the tablet form for me. It does give me some side effects such as an upset stomach and a weird energizing feeling (less with capsule for me), but if you truly need the medicine, please take it. This virus, if left untreated, can destroy your health and well-being and possibly kill you. Do not underestimate what it can do to your body.	10	April 2, 2020	9
Acyclovir IV Infusion	Herpes Zoster	Relieved my itching and rash after 1 1/2 days	9	February 26, 2020	6
Acyclovir IV Infusion	Herpes Simplex	I had back to back outbreaks after 8 years of no outbreaks at all. I take two 400mg tablets of aciclovir a day and I have not had an outbreak since. It has honestly saved my life. I forget I even carry the virus (I told my partner when we got together) and we have unprotected sex and have not passed it on (I have never transmitted to a partner)  TRY THE MEDS THEY WORK.. thank god	10	February 10, 2020	33
Acyclovir IV Infusion	Herpes Zoster	Discovered I had shingles after reading the Google medical journal lol. Started with mysterious left leg flu like feeling, and excruciating burning pain almost to tears on my left butt cheek. Then bumps on my butt. Decided to take monolaurin (dietary supplement) 3-3x/day for 2 days instead of going to dr. I had no pain and rash was going away. I caved and went to dr to get an Rx of an antiviral so I wouldn’t get post neuralgia. After taking for 2 days I now realize it’s messing with my head. It’s making me feel hopeless and no interest. I am going to discontinue and hope for the best. I will continue with Monolaurin as I think it helped stave off additional outbreaks.	1	February 9, 2020	6
Acyclovir IV Infusion	Herpes Simplex	I had a rash on my hand that my doctor thought (misdiagnosed) was the shingles. I was prescribed acyclovir and I had a severe allergic reaction. It turns out it was Dyshidrosis (pompholyx) blisters on your hands from stress. Chickenpox/shingles are viral, you do not need to take anything except pain medication. I suffered with hives all over my body the size of dinner plates, it felt like I was being burned alive. I was throwing up, lost weight and my skin/face began to show signs of jaundice. I thought I maybe fatal at one point, my skin began to thin to the point I was seeing the coloration of muscle underneath. I still have scars from it. I had these terrible hives for three months until I was given a steroid shot and montelukast. It was a terrible allergic reaction and this medication is known to cause Steven Johnsons Syndrome (SJS), google it because it is terrifying. The hives were gone in 24 hours after getting steroid shot. Do not take this medication, you could get SJS which can be  the end of your life  or ruin your life.		December 29, 2019	7

Acyclovir IV Infusion	Herpes Zoster	The acyclovir from Camber Drug Co. and shaped like a stop sign don't work very well. The last ones I had from another company worked just fine. But now  I feel like I'm on the start of a big flair. Been taking this stop sign pill shaped pill for 3 weeks. It fails to do what it should do.	3	December 13, 2019	5
Acyclovir IV Infusion	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	First out break of HSV2 at 18,  then  I had NO symptoms at all for 8 YEARS!  Then got back to back out breakouts at 26 years old for 3 months.  Started taking aciclovir 400mg twice a day as suppressive therapy and have had NO symptoms since, for three months.  Side effects minimal.  My advice is just try it because it has saved me :) x	10	December 10, 2019	16
Acyclovir IV Infusion	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	I was diagnosed in Jan this year . But I didn’t know I had it I faintly remember years ago having a cut down there that hurt really bad . ( I think that’s when I got infected ) I’ve been on the acyclovir med coming up on year now. I still get outbreaks frequently.. nothing is working I also have PCOS . I have hsv1 & 2 but never had an outbreak on my mouth . I’ll get little bumps on my nose .	3	December 3, 2019	3
Acyclovir IV Infusion	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	I wasn't told by my sexual partner that they had herpes, I got very ill & was having reproductive problems at the time. I had a few blister type spots and I went to the doctors got acyclovir and it went within 2 days and it's been over a month or 2 now and it hasn't come back.  But he went and continued infecting unsuspecting women.  I'm 21	10	October 12, 2019	11
Acyclovir IV Infusion	Herpes Simplex	Prescribed for cold sore outbreaks, three 400mg  tabs per day, took for 2 days; my heart is racing, cannot concentrate, blood pressure 157/91, my blood pressure was 120/74 two days prior to using this medication, a general feeling of unwellness, 		August 28, 2019	16
Acyclovir IV Infusion	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	I ended up misdiagnosed on several occasions with what felt like a uti and or thrush. After five days of agony and burning fever I knew something was wrong. I had one sore which experts misdiagnosed as a cyst. Finally a GP confirmed my worst fears. An STD in my thirties. I can still count my encounters on one hand but anyone that has sex risk takes the virus and I was just unlucky. I was lucky my partner who was a week into our relationship was so supportive. I take acyclovir as a preventative medication to avoid more breakouts and it works a treat. I get the odd itch but no symtoms. I sometimes feel tired with it and alcohol I have to be careful with. Otherwise I really recommend it for self esteem getting back on your feet and with the whole acceptance aspect. One in six of us have it. This makes it manageable. A vaccine or cure would be better still... But out of all the illnesses and diseases this isn't the worst one.. Count the blessings x	10	August 27, 2019	49
Acyclovir IV Infusion	Herpes Simplex	I've been using Acyclovir for some time now. Sadly I am noticing that it takes longer to work when I am having an outbreak and I am also noticing outbreaks in different places I never had them before. My hair is beginning to fall out which I was never told was a side affect. I am stressing even more having to deal with those  which is cause more frequent outbreaks.	6	August 19, 2019	13
Acyclovir IV Infusion	Herpes Simplex	So I am 65 and haven’t had an outbreak for 4 years.    In the past couple of days I’ve had a burning sensation that comes and goes.   It’s in a different place than I’ve ever had it.   There is absolutely nothing to see, no blisters or sore.   But it is so tender I’m lying around with ice on my crotch.  My jeans shorts were painful to the area.    I have the Acyclovir on hand but how do I know if it’s a herpes outbreak.?   It almost feels like it’s bruised.  Again nothing visible.   Is this a giant outbreak waiting to surface?? Is it harmful to take a corse of it “just to be safe?		August 8, 2019	13
Acyclovir IV Infusion	Herpes Simplex	Stress is NO good for people with HSV2 it activates the virus. I’ve had a rash for about 3 months. Until I got fed up and missed seeing my privates clean and smooth so took a trip to my gyno and she prescribed me acyclovir twice a day and it’s almost clearing up!! On my 5th day of taking the pill.	9	July 28, 2019	15
Acyclovir IV Infusion	Herpes Simplex	Have had HSV-2 for 15 years. Take the pills on a schedule and try to avoid being stressed because this disease will never go away. Eventually you just get use to having it. Stay positive.		July 5, 2019	28
Acyclovir IV Infusion	Herpes Simplex	I am a 30 yr old woman and I recently became diagnosed with genital herpes a few days. I started seeing a guy that didn't know he's infected with it. We had sex one of the times without a condom and BOOM here I am. I started having a burning while peeing a few days later, vaginal irritation, stomach cramping ect. I was given a RX for an UTI. 3 days later, I broke out in a few painful little bumps, and the burning in my urination got worse. Then I got a fever. I went to the ER and the doctor diagnosed me genital herpes. Luckily it's a small localized area she said, and gave me Acyclovir  400 MG to take 3x a day. I'm on the 3rd day and it's a huge difference. The site is healing, it's not burning when I urinate, no more fever, and a lot less discharge. I've gotten some side effects of being very drowsy and tired, and tingling random places. The only thing I hate is the drowsiness. I've been fighting to stay awake at work the past 2 days of it really kicking in.	10	June 27, 2019	23
Acyclovir IV Infusion	Herpes Simplex	I became very irritated down there to the point  it hurt to go to the bathroom I schedule an appointment for the doctor and they told me I had a yeast infection I then noticed bumps down there and they tested for HSV2 (herpes simplex 2) came back positive. Currently day 3 of acyclovir and I am so happy to almost be back to myself. The pain I went through was unbearable... had to call out of work several times because I could barely walk. We will see how this medicine works for me overtime	8	June 10, 2019	18
Acyclovir IV Infusion	Zovirax (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	I get coldsores mainly in the summer, my symptoms start of with dry and itchy lips, and then they start to blister and swell, I recommend if you have the same symptoms as me then put the Zovirax on as SOON AS POSSIBLE! The cold sore feels much better as soon as it’s on, the healing begins straight away, the blister on the mouth begins to dry out so it may feel uncomfortable, because of this I also use Carmex Lip Balm to keep my lips moisturised. I use Zovirax every time I get a cold sore and they heal much faster, for me it’s max 4 days. Amazing product and definietely worth the money!	10	April 14, 2019	8
Acyclovir IV Infusion	Herpes Simplex	"Have had HSV2 for 30 years and take Acyclovir 400 mg for episodic outbreaks. In the ""early years"",I used Zovirax ointment, which is very good, but the tablets are betteras you take the medication early, before the dreadful outbreak, in the form of Acyclovir 400mg/2-3x daily for 3-5 days has been an unbelievable blessing. It IS a horrible disease, but Acyclovir makes it bearable."	10	April 8, 2019	13
Acyclovir IV Infusion	Cold Sores	Summary - If you get a cold sore, use Valacyclovir and Xerese ASAP and don't stop until it is gone!!!    Details - My nose (area between the two nostrils) started getting red Tuesday morning.   I just put Neosporin on it Tuesday night.  I woke up Wed realizing it was a cold sore issue.  I was out of town and didn't have the cold sore meds with me.  I got Valacyclovir filled and immediately starting taking 2 pills in the AM and PM.  I then got Acyclovir cream filled (as Xerese was not available).  I used that cream almost every two hours.  It is very good, but not as optimal as Xerese.  I kept taking both drugs all day Wed and Thursday, even though for Valacyclovir you can stop after 1 day.  I didn't want to chance it.  I got home late Thursday from traveling and swapped out Acyclovir for Xerese.  Results - AMAZING!  All I had was a very tiny scar on Friday afternoon.		March 16, 2019	3
Acyclovir IV Infusion	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	I was diagnosed with HSV-2 six  months ago. The guy I was seeing had told me before we slept together, and we always used condoms, but it was still transmitted. First outbreak was grim and lasted for about a month, huge blisters on my thighs rendered me unable to walk. I stopped dating for a long time because I couldn't seem to control the outbreaks, and it seemed I was getting them back-to-back every week (although they never came out as full sores, just slight itching and discomfort). I started taking suppressive acyclovir (2 x 400mg per day) after 4 months, and so far the 'outbreaks' have just been itchy with no visible sores. Though I do still get them frequently despite leading a healthy, for the most part stress-free lifestyle. I will continue to take suppressive acyclovir for the foreseeable future to see if my body can eventually adjust to the virus.	7	February 9, 2019	13
Acyclovir IV Infusion	Herpes Simplex	When using oral and cream at onset gets rid of them fast. But remember this oral stuff  really bad on the liver. If outbreaks are like a few times a year not to worry. If down in Mexico can get for a fraction of the cost then in the states.	10	January 25, 2019	6
Acyclovir IV Infusion	Sitavig (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	This stuff is amazing! At first it was difficult to apply to gums (it is a tablet you stick on your gums and you don't swallow it). It say sto use round side to apply to gums but I found it easier to use flat side of tablet. If you catch it in time you just get a tiny bump and it goes down by the next day. I haven't had a bad blister in over a year. Use to get them 3 to 4 times a year. Now, maybe 2. If u don't have insurance this medication will be expensive unfortunately.	9	January 19, 2019	2
Acyclovir IV Infusion	Herpes Simplex	My fiance and I discovered, in the beginning of our relationship, that we both had genital herpes. My first outbreak was the ABSOLUTE worst experience, I was so sick. We suffered for 2 years, had constant breakouts and then finally we decided to both respectively take acyclovir. Doses are 800 mg tablet every day, and honest to goodness it was a miracle drug. We have been on it for 3 months now and except for an occasional itch here and there that lasts for a day and then goes away, neither of us have had the lesions or the terrible symptoms. We do not take it when we feel symptoms; instead, we take 800mg every day, possibly for the rest of our lives but that's okay so long as we never have to experience another outbreak!!	10	December 5, 2018	20
Acyclovir IV Infusion	Cold Sores	Its no exaggeration that cold sores on my lips has in a way, been ruining my life. It has ended relationships, and I've learned to become ashamed. I had a boyfriend in high school who kissed me with one and now I get them several times a year, and in the winter its back to back. Its horrible.  But this drug is a life saver. I wake up with mine, no tingles. I blast them instantly with 2 at a time ever few hours, and by the end of the night the blisters will cease. What took a week to two weeks to heal now only takes days, sometimes its not even noticeable at all. I now take this everyday to prevent outbreaks. This is a huge relief in my life. I recommend for anyone who suffers like me!	10	November 29, 2018	18
Acyclovir IV Infusion	Herpes Simplex	taking 400mg once a day works for me to prevent outbreaks		October 30, 2018	7
Acyclovir IV Infusion	Cold Sores	I'm a 35 year old female who has suffered from cold sores for so long I have pictures of me as a 3 year old with them, almost every year book picture, me with a cold sore. Every period, stressed, every Holiday. I was prescribed Acyclovir at 33 years old after giving birth to my first child. I had an outbreak and worried about my son catching the virus from me (Herpes is dangerous/deadly for infants) as my mother was so irresponsible when I caught it young. It's amazing, I remember thinking as a small child If given 3 wishes, one would be never get Cold sores again. I'd been on it and hadn't experienced one in almost 2 years. I'm very grateful l I'd never experienced ocular or genital herpes and have great sympathy for those who do. Acyclovir is a miracle for me	10	September 30, 2018	11
Acyclovir IV Infusion	Cold Sores	I use this drug for the occasional cold sore that I get on and/or around my mouth. I live in Mexico and found this drug over the counter. Super sad to hear the cream costs $200 !! Here a 5g tube and 50 tabs of 400 mg tablets cost me a whopping $7 USD. I have a few different tubes so I can have it available if I ever feel a tingle.  And since it’s so cheap if I see even a stranger with a cold sore I offer it to them. It is a miracle worker for me. If I am fortunate enough to catch it in time to take a pill it rarely goes to a full blister. And if it does it is contained to a very slight bump. For me it also relieves any discomfort.	10	September 19, 2018	6
Acyclovir IV Infusion	Herpes Simplex	After trying A LOT of different things Acyclovir is definitely what you need to be taking ASAP. As soon as you feel any tingling at all. If you are unfortunate enough to have reached the weeping sores phase I found the only thing to soothe the pain was salt water with black tea. Pop a tea bag in with hot very salty water and cleanse your intimate area once cool enough. Sounds mad but you'll thank me after!	8	September 5, 2018	15
Acyclovir IV Infusion	Herpes Zoster	I had  herpes zoster in April 2017, was  prescribed   acyclovir 400mg x2  with anti-allergic tabs  for seven days and  was cured  although  after-effects were felt for long.   Interestingly,  I also got rid of another medical condition that had been  bothering me for more than a year prior to the  herpes   attack.  After one year,  symptoms of  old  problem (not herpes) developed again.  I told  doctor about the effect  acyclovir tabs had on it a year ago.  But the doctor laughed away  my observations  and  prescribed  other medicines.  When  I didn't get  relief even after my third visit to her, she reluctantly prescribed acyclovir tabs.  I was completely cured after eight days. Before going public with full details,   I would like to share it with  manufacturers of acyclovir tabs.  They may like to initiate some more research on this wonderful drug and arrive at a definitive conclusion vis-a-vis my observations.    I may  offer myself for  clinical trials, if necessary.	10	August 19, 2018	8
Acyclovir IV Infusion	Zovirax (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	Took one ten day course of this anti-viral over seven years ago and have never had even a hint of another fever blister symptom ever since.   I felt better after first week, and remarkably stronger after completing  the 10 day prescription . Next best thing to a cure.	9	July 9, 2018	15

Acyclovir IV Infusion	Herpes Simplex	Great drug .. it’s a shame the cream is so expensive. Tablet for relatively inexpensive. Why is the ointment so expensive?		May 6, 2018	5
Acyclovir IV Infusion	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	My first outbreak was horrific. I could not walk for a week the pain was so unbearable. I laid in bed the whole time with cold packs between my legs and dreaded when having to use the bathroom because the pain was excruciating. I started this medication 4 days after I was infected and had symptoms. It did help and I have been on it for a couple of months now and no side effects. My doctor wants me to be on it for 2 years for suppressive therapy and then try to get off of it. She did inform me however that if I had several outbreaks, she had no problem putting me back on it. She assured me it was safe longterm. There have been times I have forgotten to take my meds and within a few days I have some symptoms, but then I start back up again and in a few days, I am feeling better. This medicine truly allows me to forget that I have HSV-2, other than when I take my meds. It’s been a miracle for me.	10	March 25, 2018	14
Acyclovir IV Infusion	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	I've had fever blisters since I was a child. When I was a teenager I got fever blisters a lot.  As I got older usually just in the summer. About 4 years  ago I was getting them every other month. Dr put me on 400mg twice daily. Have not had any in the last year and a half.  What a difference its made in my life!	10	March 25, 2018	5

Acyclovir IV Infusion	Cold Sores	16 years ago I was accidentally poked in my eye. The following day my eye flared up  very inflamed and painful. I was diagnosed  with viral keratitis (cold sore virus in the eye).  About 5 years later they finally put me on zovirax  tablets 800mg. I found them great. Didn't take long for to clear it up  while also using zovirax  eye ointment  I have had less breakouts over the years compared to the 3 or 4 a year I had been experiencing before be I got prescribed this. These tablets were the answer to my prayers as it's extremely painful when I have an outbreak in my eyes. I currently have an outbreak and my doctor has me on 400mg five times a day as well as  the eye ointment. I've found with this medication the breakouts are less  frequent and the symptoms less severe. Also this  is free for me as it's cover by medical card which is great. No side effects. For me I would highly recommend  zovirax aka adviclor  to anyone  wanting to treat an outbreak	10	February 23, 2018	3
Acyclovir IV Infusion	Herpes Simplex	For the last year I've been plagued with severe cold sore/herpes outbreaks around my lips, chin and nose. A never ending cycle of breakout, heal, breakout. After one day of using the cream and Acyclovir the large bump on the side of my lip flattened to the point of not noticing it. Day six and I haven't seen my face look this clear in years. One little teeny whitehead popped up last night below my lip but you can't tell its a herpes sore.  It kind of seemed like a final whimper. If I could rate prior breakouts as a 10 for worst case scenario, this little guy would be a 1. And I'd even thank someone for it. One last thing, If you're insured look around for community health centers, call them and ask for a low cost pharmacy to fill your prescription. I've read online the same Zovirax cream prescription goes for $200, and Acyclovir anywhere from $80-200. I paid $100 for both. Do some research!	10	February 19, 2018	5
Acyclovir IV Infusion	Cold Sores	Great medicine I've never experienced side effects that I'm aware of and took while pregnant.	10	February 1, 2018	3
Acyclovir IV Infusion	Herpes Simplex	I had HSV-2 in my 20s.  My doctor gave me a strong prescription of Zyclovair and I think it was for 30 days.  I never had an outbreak again.  The outbreak that I was seen for, was my first and only one and it was really quite bad.  Now I am 49 without a herpes outbreak following the treatment.	10	January 16, 2018	32
Acyclovir IV Infusion	Herpes Simplex	I’ve been having cold sores since I was 12 on my lips and face. I tried everything and nothing would work. My doctor prescribed me this when he realized how serious it was. I was getting them sometimes one right after the other one!  I’m supposed to take one gram a day, but I found that when I did that I still got them frequently. So I only take it when I feel a tingle , I take about 4 and it never comes out. What sucks is when I don’t get the tingle and I just wake up with a full blow on sore/sores. Overall medicine really helps though! Completely free with my insurance as well!	7	October 22, 2017	2
Acyclovir IV Infusion	Herpes Simplex	Been taking this medicine for two years with no outbreaks and no side effects. It's been life changing.	10	September 14, 2017	15
Acyclovir IV Infusion	Cold Sores	My experience is that I have had cold sores ONLY on my lips from age 6 to 35. I agreed to a 1st date...bam! I felt it. That is the key; take meds once 1st felt. I have no medical knowledge except I know what my body tolerates and what has been successful which may not be your best bet but be safe careful and consult you Dr b4 any treatment plan.  1. break up your pills in half for immediate absorbtion take 800mg every 2 hours to slam your system to alert it there's an issue and send in a 2nd round of 800 within 1st 4 hours 2. continue 800 for 2 days every 4 hours 3. apply Abreva or similar product on the sore at first sensation, while taking the meds so you are attacking the infection from inside (meds) and externally (creme on sore) 4 days	9	August 23, 2017	8

Acyclovir IV Infusion	Herpes Simplex	I'm 48 and I was diagnosed with genital herpes when I was 35. I started dating a new guy and within 2 weeks I felt horrible burning when I urinated. I went to my midwives and sure enough I had herpes. Funny thing is I wasn't with anyone prior to him and I was with him for 6 years and not once did he ever test positive. They actually claim I could have had it on my face touched it and touched my genitals without washing my hands and transferred it. The outbreaks are less and less over the years but when I feel one coming I take acyclovir 500mg 2x daily. It helps right away. And I use a squirt bottle with warm water as I urinated to help reduce the burning.	10	July 1, 2017	21
Acyclovir IV Infusion	Herpes Simplex	Good day to every one reading this, I am here to give my testimony about a  herbal doctor  called dr tokubo who helped me in my life. I was infected with HERPES SIMPLEX virus in 2015, i went to many hospitals for cure and they told me there was no solution for it, so I was thinking how i can  get a solution so that my body can be okay. One day I was in the river side thinking where I can go to get solution, Along the line a lady walked to me telling me why am I so sad and i open up all to her telling her my problem, she told me that she can help me out, she introduce me to a doctor who uses herbal medication to cure HERPES SIMPLEX virus and gave me his email, so i mail him to order for his herbal medicine.

Acyclovir IV Infusion	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	I have found that acyclovir works better for me when I take pine cone extract. I believe this extract works as an adjuvant, increases the potency of this antiviral drug.  I have been using this combination for several years and have had only two outbreaks in 3 years apposed to 3-4 a year when only using acyclovir 400 mg daily. This makes me believe that the extract is working.  Research suggests that certain compounds found in pine cone extract increases specific Dendritic immune cells.	8	June 1, 2017	14
Acyclovir IV Infusion	Cold Sores	It gave me prostate issues and erection problems. I never had a breakout. The trade off wasn't worth it.		May 17, 2017	1
Acyclovir IV Infusion	Herpes Simplex	I found out I contracted genital herpes from an ex boyfriend about 5 years ago. It initially felt like a cut on my vagina that itched and burned. Went to Dr next day and sure enough- herpes (ugh). I take the medicine as needed and it works like a charm. If I do feel one coming I take 400mg  three day for about 4-5 days. Clears right up. I also used to get cold sore a few times a year- haven't since taking this medicine. It's AMAZING. Just wish I never had to find out about it.	9	April 5, 2017	25
Acyclovir IV Infusion	Herpes Simplex	At 29 weeks pregnant I had a fever. Thought I was leaking amniotic fluid. Went to the hospital and misdiagnosed with a UTI. Stayed overnight with IVF and antibiotics and checked, monitored and ultrasound before discharged the following day. 24 hours later still not having felt well went back to the hospital and rechecked, water broke dilated to 2 and Dr said she didn't think of it before, but was going to test and treat me for Genital Herpes. Right after the emergency c section. 	7	April 4, 2017	5
Acyclovir IV Infusion	Herpes Simplex	About 5 days ago I realized a cut, I thought I had cut myself while shaving... it then got very uncomfortable and burned while I urinated. Finally, I took my camera down there and wanted to look... I noticed a few more cuts  that look like canker sores so I made an appointment right away. She told me it looked like genital herpes. She gave my the cream and the pills. It's only been a day and it doesn't feel like it's working. I know it's soon. But I still feel like I'm on fire, I'm itchy, and it still burns like crazy. Is there anything else I can do?	2	March 29, 2017	17
Acyclovir IV Infusion	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	I have found this drug to be very effective in controlling my IBS/ inflammatory bowel disease.  Clearly it's possible herpes has a role to play in these conditions.	9	March 7, 2017	12
Acyclovir IV Infusion	Herpes Simplex	This is the only thing that works for myself stress induced break outs (college). I use both the pills and the cream. I believe when I first started using acyclovir it was more effective  and now it can take a good 4-5 days to fully heal. This is nothing in comparison to a cold sore that lasted a month without the meds though! 400mg. Free with my healthcare for the pills, the cream was $25.	9	February 22, 2017	8
Acyclovir Ointment	Zovirax Cream (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	Zovirax burnt my skin around the cold sore leaving a red mark 2-3 times larger than my cold sore! It also caused this skin to peel. My cold sore is essentially gone after approximately 6 days but now I am left with a very obvious and huge red mark. If you use this cream and it stings or burns at all when you apply it I would suggest stopping usage straight away. It says that this may be a “mild” symptom of using the cream. I wish I had stopped using it as soon as I felt the stinging sensation.	2	April 20, 2021	0
Acyclovir Ointment	Zovirax Cream (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	I'm from the UK, and have had cold sores all my life (40s)  Zovirax is a complete waste of money.  For years I used it because I believed the marketing - and i thought that cold sores just got bigger, but about 5 years ago I tried just leaving well alone.  Without Zovirax, they crust faster, don't spread and heal faster and more naturally.  With Zovirax, I find it burns the skin, they spread (keep popping up outside the original zone) and scar for longer.   I've also not really found that Zovirax prevents them if you get there during the original tingling either.  Also - the tube size is a scandal.	1	February 16, 2021	4
Acyclovir Ointment	Herpes Simplex	I 100% recommend this acyclovir prescription/treatment to anyone suffering from herpes! I was diagnosed we with herpes simplex 1, and have used abreva, valtrex, and have tried random sworn by home remedies. Abreva after by maybe day 7 started to work, valtrex after close to a week began to work, the home remedies did not work at all!!! All in all, the effectiveness of what I've tried prior to acyclovir did not impress me as much as this prescription has. I was a day into my outbreak, my lip was already swollen and bubbled. That one day in I started the cream and the next day , it had gone down 80%. It was already scabbed over and no longer pulsating! This has definitely been a blessing to me, as I am very skeptical at times when it comes to medications that says to be close to 100% effective!	10	February 2, 2021	3
Acyclovir Ointment	Zovirax Cream (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	Not so much the effect but the affect of opening this packaging? I could not believe my eyes the size of 2g tube? Absolutely shocking to say the least & for £5. Once I pierced it open I could then turn the tube at least 3 times before the cream appeared. I'm sure this is a great product? But will there be enough to get rid of my problem?	5	January 22, 2021	1
Acyclovir Ointment	Zovirax Cream (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	Would highly recommend giving this a go. Was diagnosed with HSV1 cold sores last year and this has by far been my best experience. Had a cold sore first appear yesterday and has pretty much already cleared up after using this Zovirax Duo a few times over the course of 24 hours. Love this stuff!	10	October 14, 2020	2
Acyclovir Ointment	Cold Sores	Everyone is saying how expensive it is $250 etc, why don't you buy a uk version and have it delivered to USA, here in uk online you can buy Zovirax (active ingredient 5% acyclovir) for like £5.00 which will be like $7.50	10	August 19, 2020	1
Acyclovir Ointment	Herpes Simplex	"I have had cold sore outbreaks around my mouth since my childhood. I have tried absolutely everything (i.e. : Lipactin, Abreva and so on) and the only topical treatment I've found to be effective is acyclovir cream 5% (I buy generics). If applied early in the onset, sores typically remain small and will dry within a day or two. Before switching to acyclovir cream, an outbreak would last from 4 to 7 days. Now, 2 to 4 days is the usual. It feels like you are skipping the nasty and uncomfortable phase right after the outbreak to go straight to the ""recovery"" phase where the skin is healing under the dried scabs. I always carry some with me now."	9	August 12, 2020	6
Acyclovir Ointment	Zovirax Cream (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	Okay so I always had cold sores all my life, one advise, don't use zovirex. It spreads and it leaves a nasty scar which takes ages to heal. Use ordinary Vaseline to keep it moist but only apply small amount, too much moisture can also create the cold sore to worsen. Aqueous worked for me.		June 24, 2020	1
Acyclovir Ointment	Zovirax Cream (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	I love zovirax, I prefer the pump tube to the metal tube as I feel it's more hygienic. However I have recently been trying Zovirax Duo which is a few dollars more than the regular cream, but it's amazing. The day after noticing a cold sore, the swelling is already very reduced and scabbing forms. I find the coldsore heals so much faster with the Duo cream	10	May 6, 2020	1
Acyclovir Ointment	Herpes Simplex	I was prescribed Acyclovir cream for face shingle treatment however I have no cold sores. I am in the scabbing phase.  My dermatologist was negligent to tell me that the tiny tube would cost $230.  This medication seems more designed for intense cold sores.  Not sure its worth a damn if I don't have cold sores and not sure I am willing to spend $230 to see if it helps my scabs lighten.  I don't hold dermatologists in high regard and now a bit less.	1	May 5, 2020	1
Acyclovir Ointment	Zovirax Cream (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	The worst stuff I have ever used. It burnt and scarred my skin. The cold sore was almost invisible, and Zovirax burnt it and thee surrounding skin. It made it look awful, and made it painful, and took three weeks to heal. NEVER AGAIN,  Beware!	1	March 30, 2020	7
Acyclovir Ointment	Zovirax Cream (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	It works for me. No doubt about it. But in Canada I had to pay $80 for a tiny tube. Then, 2/3 of the tube was air. So thanks for that.	10	December 24, 2019	6
Acyclovir Ointment	Zovirax Ointment (acyclovir) for Herpes Simplex	There is some confusion about the cream vs. the ointment.  Chemically, acyclovir is acyclovir.  The only difference between the two is only the 'CARRIER' - cream vs ointment.  The ointment (for genital herpes in U.S.) has polyethylene glycol, a very slippery compound used as in laxatives and for bowel prep.  It has many other medical and industrial uses. Considering the small amount possibly ingested when applying to the mouth, the only reason not to use the cheaper ointment is if you are sensitive to polyethylene glycol.   The cream (oral herpes/cold sores) contains  mineral oil, (also a laxative) poloxamer 407, propylene glycol, sodium lauryl sulfate, water, and white petrolatum.  Proplylene glycol is supposedly good for skin, stops flaking, etc.   Despite hours of research I can't find why cream is so expensive unless maker thinks we'll pay more for a treatment for our face vs genitals. The CREAM is the one that is SO OUTRAGEOUSLY EXPENSIVE!!	10	December 19, 2019	9
Acyclovir Ointment	Zovirax Cream (acyclovir) for Herpes Simplex	I have had a spot come up twice in 14 years on my index finger.   Index finger on right hand, infected when worked as a dental assistant on patients.  This time they prescribed this cream and I noticed a great change. You never know what you're exposed to in the medical/ dental field. Gloves still tear. But luckily they are Meds to help. This product has lessened the swelling and throbbing.	7	December 14, 2019	5
Acyclovir Ointment	Zovirax Cream (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	I'm also from the UK and like most of the comments from the UK, the cream does not help. Again bought some and it seems to make it spread. I'm sure if I didn't use it it would not be as bad as it is this morning. Maybe there IS a difference between US and UK . I must remind myself not to bother with this again.... try something else... pity	1	December 5, 2019	9
Acyclovir Ointment	Cold Sores	I was prescribed Acyclovir Ointment 5%.  First of all, the tube was tiny and cost me $113.00.  Secondly, this cream did not work on my cold sore.  I followed the instructions and used it every 3 hours.  I am on day 8 of 10 and my cold sore is still there and does not look like it is healing.  Don't waste your money.  Use Abreva instead.	1	December 1, 2019	0
Acyclovir Ointment	Cold Sores	This is by far the best cold sore ingredient. The ointment+pills have worked wonders for me. I am never the person to leave reviews, but needed too for someone like you out there who's looking for a cure to Cold Sores. *ACYCLOVIR IS THE BEST*	10	September 25, 2019	2
Acyclovir Ointment	Zovirax Cream (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	the cream works for me but I but also have to avoid sun and wind exposure. It is probably best stay home as much as possible.	9	August 6, 2019	4

Acyclovir Ointment	Zovirax Cream (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	You can buy this off the shelf in the UK, at any pharmacy and many supermarkets, for around £5 for a 2g pump. Worth stocking up if you're visiting from the US!!	10	July 4, 2019	8
Acyclovir Ointment	Zovirax Cream (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	Way better than abreva! 1 to 2 days max and it is gone.	10	December 28, 2018	11
Acyclovir Ointment	Zovirax Cream (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	Zorvirax duo honestly works wonders! As soon as I feel the tingling I lather it on and it’s gone the next day! There are also tablets that you can take but they only work if the cold sore hasn’t appeared yet and you’re only getting the tingling sensation. Just ask for them at your chemist. They’re 3 pills and you take them all at once and the cold sore doesn’t even come up. I got my lips done and I got a cold sore the next day used the cream and it was gone. I went to get them done a second time and took the tablets as a precaution and no cold sore even appeared! Love love love the cream!		December 10, 2018	8
Acyclovir Ointment	Zovirax Cream (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	I love Zovirax in the little pump. Clears up cold sores in 3 days. However I’ve noticed the amount of cream in the pump has become less. Disappointing.	8	December 10, 2018	8
Acyclovir Ointment	Cold Sores	Works every time if you get it at the first signs of a cold sore.  For US cold sore sufferers can who make it to Mexico, you can get it over the counter under a generic brand  for 65 pesos at any supermarket with a pharmacy - that is about $3 USD.	10	August 11, 2018	3
Acyclovir Ointment	Zovirax Cream (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	The cold sores usually don't even appear if I apply the cream at the first signs of tingling. Once, I failed to catch the tingly symptoms at the start, and only realised when my lips began to harden and split. I rushed to the pharmacy to purchase Zovirax, and I managed to dodge the embarrassing process of allowing the cold sore to fully blister and crust. I bet no one even suspected I had cold sores.  I don't know why everyone is comparing prices here, but it costs approximately USD $15 for a 2g tube where I come from. Just apply a little will do, I'm not sure why someone mentioned finishing the 2g tube within 3 days. It can last me two years, before it expires. Read the directions that it comes with.	10	July 19, 2018	7
Acyclovir Ointment	Zovirax Cream (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	Had a wedding and got a cold sore 3 says prior. Used the cream every half hour till the day. Totally disappeared. Couldn't even see them in the photos. Highly recommend to everyone.	10	June 22, 2018	13
Acyclovir Ointment	Zovirax Cream (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	This stuff is amazing does not burn, it heals the pain & cold sore		June 15, 2018	7
Acyclovir Ointment	Cold Sores	The best medicine for cold sores! I apply it as much as possible throughout the day and have never had a blister since using it. Would recommend it to everyone.	10	May 3, 2018	2
Acyclovir Ointment	Zovirax Cream (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	I just want to mention that in my country zovirax costs something like 10$ 10g! I cannot believe how expensive is in US. Thats insane	10	March 13, 2018	6
Acyclovir Ointment	Zovirax Cream (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	Zovirax cream is amazing.  I hardly ever get an actual cold sore anymore, because I apply the cream as soon as I feel any tingle and it prevents the outbreak. Well, 3 days ago, I missed the tingle because I had a huge pimple forming on my chin, just under my lip, and it was so painful that it masked the tingle on my lip.  By the time I woke up & realized what was happening, my lip had already swollen quite badly.  I was horrified & thought the battle was already lost, but I immediately started applying Zovirax.  My lip still swelled up to 3 times its size over the next 36 hours, but then it started to recede and never even blistered!  It is now 3 days after it started & my lip is almost back to normal.  I cannot believe it worked when the cold sore had already taken hold, and stopped the blisters from erupting.  I love this stuff so much!  It cost about $80 for a 5g tube the last time I bought it, but it lasts a long time for me.  I always carry it in my purse so I am armed for battle.	10	March 2, 2018	8
Acyclovir Ointment	Zovirax Cream (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	Zovirax works great on cold sores. I use at first sign for a few days and it doesn't even blister. If I get a blister it doesn't get big and dries up 2  to 3 days. Abreva never worked for me. This stuff is great	10	February 22, 2018	5
Acyclovir Ointment	Zovirax Cream (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	Zovirax does work. The trick is to apply small amounts as soon as possible and as often as possible. The more times you apply the more chances you have of healing quicker. Applying 3 x a day just aint going to cut it. (Every hour or less if you have to)		February 17, 2018	7
Acyclovir Ointment	Herpes Simplex	I use the generic brand by Mylan. This product is amazing. Even if you have a bad outbreak it cuts the healing time by a few days. That may seem minimal to some, but those who suffer from cold sores, this is superb. If you apply it during the first signs you will not even have an outbreak.	10	January 4, 2018	5
Acyclovir Ointment	Zovirax Cream (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	OMG LOL  extremely ridiculous how Zovirax cream expensive in USA  $700 plus!  Zovirax cream It costs in other countries  less than $20.00   It's very sad how they take  advantage of people here in USA.  Less than $20. Lol same Zovirax cream. Have mercy on people and stop using them like this!		December 16, 2017	6
Acyclovir Ointment	Herpes Simplex	I was diagnosed with genital herpes earlier today, though the symptoms began a month ago and I mistaken it for a yeast infection. The sores started last Monday (5 days ago).  The burning was so bad to the point where I had trouble walking. After applying acyclovir earlier I experienced moderate burning for a short amount of time but after sitting down for awhile I felt relief. let's hope that tomorrow the sores aren't as painful	7	November 26, 2017	9
Acyclovir Ointment	Zovirax Cream (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	My son had a cold sores out break, got a Zovirax cream as treatment. It works well but the cream ran out before cold sore. I paid $14 for a tube 2g of Zovirax, the amount of cream not even cover 3 days treatment. The tube with a size of lips sunscreen but the amount of cream inside is ridiculously tiny. Such a ripoff, please consider low income consumer with your products.	7	October 10, 2017	3
Acyclovir Ointment	Zovirax Cream (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	Zovirax cream has 50mg of acyclovir in it -doesn't it? It was in the contents ingredients information list. Zovirax cream is a MIRACLE CURE!! Coldsores  -dab it on asap a small tiny bit -Bumps on skin like welts or hives (Shingles?) +very painful +scary looking like chicken pox -connect the bumps/dots.  It's stress+anxiety like someone else said...lack of sleep+you haven't been eating since the ?other? day+working extra daysTHENnights+ little catnap sleeps+ you find junk sugar loaded snacks +even the fruit+applesauce cups+granola =huge sugar/salt +sugar drinks+ creamy sugar coffee day+night to just get through those sudden double shifts =Reactions- cold sores +hive like sores+ACNE!

Acyclovir Ointment	Zovirax Cream (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	I am 21 years old and just suffered from my first major breakout of cold sores in my life. It was pretty bad and I was frustrated from the unsightly sores appearing on my lips and mouth. I also had an outbreak just below my eye in the sensitive skin. I went to the doctor and she prescribed me with the Zovirax cream and I saw a lessened appearance in worst of the cold sores on my lip in less than 24 hours. While it takes time for them to heal, I definitely think this is a worthwhile drug. It cost me $45 so its not super cheap, but it really alleviated some of my symptoms. I had another cold sore forming on my lip just below the bad one and it stopped that one dead in its tracks and I already see it healing and not blistering. Worth it!	10	May 8, 2017	1
Acyclovir Ointment	Cold Sores	You are going to love this, my small tube of aciclovir ointment costs $900.  Welcome to 'Merica.  Luckily my insurance covered it or I would have lots of cold sores.  The stuff is marginally effective if you catch the cold sores at the right moment.  I am switching over to oral hoping for better results.  	4	April 10, 2017	0
Acyclovir Ointment	Zovirax Ointment (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	COLD SORE TREATMENTS AND PREVENTION THAT WORK: L-lysine: You can buy L-lysine over the counter in tablet form, one a day pretty much prevents cold sores from forming.  If you run out of tablets make sure you buy more; it's like the virus sits inactive under the skin just waiting for a break from the L-lysine treatment so it can raise it's ugly head.  ZOVIRAX: If you feel a cold sore coming on or you have a cold sore buy Zovirax from the chemist or supermarket ~$17 a tube; but you only need a little bit applied 5 or 6 times a day and the last application should be before you go to sleep (whenever you think of applying it really) Zovirax helps heal the blisters much faster than anything else l have tried. ICE OR COLD PACK: If you don't have Zovirax and the cold sore is really burning and itchy get a freezer bag or similar and put some ice in it or some frozen peas and apply that to the area until that nasty burning and itchy feeling eases. Avoid licking of playing with the blisters with your tongue, this tends to make them bigger. Pop the Blisters or Don't Pop the Blisters? This is a personal preference however,  l have found that by not popping the blisters only allows the blisters to grow bigger to the point of them sometimes joining together and becoming one big blister which takes a lot longer to heal, hence, l pop the blister and apply Zovirax straight away and the majority are gone within a few days. SAFETY FIRST: DO NOT have oral sex and AVOID kissing anyone when you have an active cold sore; they do spread as quickly as a peck on the lips from someone with the active cold sore virus and wash your hands if you touch your mouth by accident, this helps prevent spreading the cold sore virus. PREVENTION: Take L-lysine 1 tablet daily and try to avoid sudden drops in temperature, excessive sun or wind. Changes in climate conditions and temperature drops can bring on the cold sore virus. Avoid rubbing your lips hard like we sometimes do to remove stubborn lipstick and avoid the hard bristles of a man's beard or regrowth, both of these things can irritate the sensitive skin on our lips. Just be mindful of the cold sore virus and it will become second nature to prevent it from occurring.	10	March 20, 2017	19
Acyclovir Oral Suspension	Cold Sores	I have taken acyclovir sporadically for the last two years. My blood cell count was low so I was forced to go off it for a number of months after beginning treatment. I resumed taking it two months ago and I must admit it has been very good. Before beginning acyclovir I had only 1-2 obs but almost constant nerve pain in the anal region. It had been like this (undiagnosed despite numerous doctor's visits) for around 17 years. After acyclovir began and then stopped because of blood cell count, it was however infinitely worse. I had permanent obs and permanent nerve pain in the anal region, and now I had permanent nerve pain in my vaginal area. my doctor originally prescribed me 400mg twice a day but I found I need to take it 3 times a day in order to quell the obs. I am hoping that in another 10-24 months it will be cured but I am suspending my belief as yet.	7	March 13, 2021	0
Acyclovir Oral Suspension	Herpes Simplex	Every few years it occurs, always keep it in reserve because if you are fast enough, a single 800mg can stop it in its tracks, maybe 2 or 3 just to be sure..	10	March 12, 2021	4
Acyclovir Oral Suspension	Herpes Simplex	I found out on Tuesday  that I have herpes went to many doctors before got diagnosed with herpes started itching in 2014 didn't know what it was but can someone give me some advice on how to rid myself of it	3	February 19, 2021	0
Acyclovir Oral Suspension	Herpes Zoster	I took Acyclovir because of shingles, I had to take 800mg 5x a day for 7 days. On the first day I was okay, second day I felt dizzy and a little  nauseous, third day I had severe nausea! Which was horrible! Other symptoms included ....feeling spaced out , stomach cramping , headache , sweating when I was asleep. It’s better to finish the course which I managed to do ! Thank god! However it did clear my rash away	9	December 17, 2020	0
Acyclovir Oral Suspension	Herpes Simplex	My child caught rash on skin. I don’t know where she came in contact with it. We had been on vacations and she was in swimming. It comes back often times every two months. It stays longer when acyclovir is used. I used the cream and the oral liquid and it the outbreak lasted for a long time and it comes back as soon as treatment stops. I’m currently trying essential oils and it clears up faster but I don’t know about the recurrences yet.	1	December 5, 2020	0
Acyclovir Oral Suspension	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	I don't know how I got infected with genital herpes - I was with someone who didn't have it so can only assume it had laid dormant for a number of years when someone else had given it to me. The first outbreak was 10 years ago, but was just an itchy spot in my pubic area close to my panty line. The second outbreak came a month or so later and was just a couple of blisters. When I was diagnosed, my whole world collapsed. I was in therapy for 2 years, it really hit me hard. I've taken acyclovir twice a day since then. I haven't had an outbreak but some days I still get the tingling and ache around my pubic area. On those days, I get very low and upset. I may try a different drug.	8	November 14, 2020	6
Acyclovir Oral Suspension	Herpes Simplex	I think it worked okay within 3 days my breakout was gone. But I don't like that you have to take it 3 times daily for a week straight then keep taking it for prevention if you get breakouts because I forget half the time. It makes me really sick if I don't eat and I have celiac disease so if you can't eat much like I can't this isn't the right kind for you. Because it's not the right one for me and the pill itself is huge looks like a dungeon and dragon symbol	9	October 31, 2020	1
Acyclovir Oral Suspension	Herpes Simplex	I'm 74 years old. First diagnosed 40 years ago so I've been using  Zovirax and acyclovir cream a while. Both have been effective in eliminating or reducing outbreaks. Especially if applied at very first signs of oncoming event. I haven't had a cold sore in that time because I apply the cream when I feel any tingling or raised skin surface. Very little cream is needed to be effective but, several applications a day works best.	10	September 24, 2020	7
Acyclovir Oral Suspension	Sitavig (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	I’ve been getting cold sores once-twice a year for the last 5 years. I do not get a small blister that turns my lip slightly red. When one emerges, it is so large and painful that one entire side of lip is completely swollen. It can be so unsightly and painful for those two weeks that I typically don’t leave the house. I’ve always taken Valtrex as quickly as possible upon feeling symptoms and haven’t found it to be effective. The Sitavig, however, has been a godsend. I applied it upon first notice of a small blister forming. The blister still appeared but is small enough that you can’t really see it unless you know what you’re looking for. There is no swelling and very, very little discomfort (slight itching). I’m only on day 2 of the sore and already it’s shrunk. Highly recommend for anyone who gets large, painful cold sores.	8	September 15, 2020	2
Acyclovir Oral Suspension	Herpes Simplex	I was diagnosed with herpes this year after getting it from my partner. I had a fairly bad first outbreak on my inner labia and just presumed it to be from shaving but I went to a sexual health clinic and got diagnosed. This medicine has been so helpful anytime I have a tingling/throbbing sensation I take it and it works wonders. I’m currently taking it at the moment and the only real side effect I have is having a headache!		July 29, 2020	7
Acyclovir Oral Suspension	Herpes Simplex	I am 43 I just recently got diagnosed with HSV2 with two previous false negative tests. It sucks not 2 know when and where you got the infection from I've never seen any breakouts on any 1 I've been with but I'm seeing you can contract this even with a condom. I have breakouts in more than 1 place inner labial outer labial which I thought was a ingrown hair infection.  Also have a breakout in the anal area but mostly the upper part of the crack which is weird. I hate this. I've been with my bf for 7 yrs he said he had a cold sore before but I don't think he gave it to me by me having 2 false tests. I'm so ashamed as I'd rather have had gonorrhea or chlamydia if I had to suffer from a STD as you can get rid of those. I haven't been able to share this news with my boyfriend as I'm afraid how he may react, he has really tripping about this COVID virus . But I may have had this 4 awhile and luckily I've never transmitted it and this is my first time with an actual blisters.	7	May 22, 2020	18
Acyclovir Oral Suspension	Herpes Simplex	My child came in contact on va cction and has a skin rash HSV-1 and this medicine does not work at all for her. I hate to see her so irritated I wish there was an actual cure. I used vinegar and coconut oils and it took just as long to clear as this drug..	1	May 20, 2020	2
Acyclovir Oral Suspension	Herpes Simplex	Started taking this after an outbreak. Thought the first one was just irritation from a wax. Realized after that second time it happened that it was definitely herpes and triggered by bikini waxing. Now take this daily to suppress and have not had an outbreak since (over a year). Have found it definitely has caused me to have increased sweating at night, which is annoying, but otherwise no issues.	10	May 11, 2020	7
Acyclovir Oral Suspension	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	I had itching for 3 months before my first HSV-2 lesion appeared. It was very mild but I had the fever, swollen lymph nodes and intense burning. I took Acyclovir for 5 days which reduced my symptoms quickly. I am now on 400mg twice daily for suppression, however I still get the odd itch here and there.	9	April 22, 2020	9
Acyclovir Oral Suspension	Herpes Simplex	I was getting many cold sores every year. I would take Acyclovir as soon as the numbness started. It never shortened the duration; never had any effect on the pain. The cold sores just kept getting worse. The doctor finally put me on a stronger anti-viral. It did nothing either. I only got headaches from the anti-virals. I finally decided to try vitamin D. I haven't had a cold sore in at least 2 years.	1	April 19, 2020	15
Acyclovir Oral Suspension	Herpes Simplex	I was prescribed this meds and it did work, years later I'm still battling with this virus, I never gave it on to anyone, anytime I feel discomfort I call my dr to send a script to the pharmacy. I have had a outbreak on different parts of my vagina and by my anus & mouth. The ones that comes by my vulvar or anus is the worst especially when I urinate I always have that cup of water to pour while I urinate so it wouldn't burn.I'm having an outbreak now I been feeling this itch & painful feeling that got me up. I took a pill about 30 min ago I can honestly tell you Im feeling the med kick in. My pill is 500mg I try to keep some on hands for times like this my dr is close.	10	April 12, 2020	3
Acyclovir Oral Suspension	Herpes Zoster	I have herpes zoster (shingles)in  internal, inner ear. Damage to both trigeminal and occipital nerve. Facial paralysis. This medicine possibly saved my life, and the capsule form worked much better than the tablet form for me. It does give me some side effects such as an upset stomach and a weird energizing feeling (less with capsule for me), but if you truly need the medicine, please take it. This virus, if left untreated, can destroy your health and well-being and possibly kill you. Do not underestimate what it can do to your body.	10	April 2, 2020	9
Acyclovir Oral Suspension	Herpes Zoster	Relieved my itching and rash after 1 1/2 days	9	February 26, 2020	6
Acyclovir Oral Suspension	Herpes Simplex	I had back to back outbreaks after 8 years of no outbreaks at all. I take two 400mg tablets of aciclovir a day and I have not had an outbreak since. It has honestly saved my life. I forget I even carry the virus (I told my partner when we got together) and we have unprotected sex and have not passed it on (I have never transmitted to a partner)  TRY THE MEDS THEY WORK.. thank god	10	February 10, 2020	33
Acyclovir Oral Suspension	Herpes Zoster	Discovered I had shingles after reading the Google medical journal lol. Started with mysterious left leg flu like feeling, and excruciating burning pain almost to tears on my left butt cheek. Then bumps on my butt. Decided to take monolaurin (dietary supplement) 3-3x/day for 2 days instead of going to dr. I had no pain and rash was going away. I caved and went to dr to get an Rx of an antiviral so I wouldn’t get post neuralgia. After taking for 2 days I now realize it’s messing with my head. It’s making me feel hopeless and no interest. I am going to discontinue and hope for the best. I will continue with Monolaurin as I think it helped stave off additional outbreaks.	1	February 9, 2020	6
Acyclovir Oral Suspension	Herpes Simplex	I had a rash on my hand that my doctor thought (misdiagnosed) was the shingles. I was prescribed acyclovir and I had a severe allergic reaction. It turns out it was Dyshidrosis (pompholyx) blisters on your hands from stress. Chickenpox/shingles are viral, you do not need to take anything except pain medication. I suffered with hives all over my body the size of dinner plates, it felt like I was being burned alive. I was throwing up, lost weight and my skin/face began to show signs of jaundice. I thought I maybe fatal at one point, my skin began to thin to the point I was seeing the coloration of muscle underneath. I still have scars from it. I had these terrible hives for three months until I was given a steroid shot and montelukast. It was a terrible allergic reaction and this medication is known to cause Steven Johnsons Syndrome (SJS), google it because it is terrifying. The hives were gone in 24 hours after getting steroid shot. Do not take this medication, you could get SJS which can be  the end of your life  or ruin your life.		December 29, 2019	7
Acyclovir Oral Suspension	Varicella-Zoster	Stuff did absolutely nothing to me . Had to rely on painkillers. That little body lotion is only made to give you hope	1	December 26, 2019	0
Acyclovir Oral Suspension	Herpes Zoster	The acyclovir from Camber Drug Co. and shaped like a stop sign don't work very well. The last ones I had from another company worked just fine. But now  I feel like I'm on the start of a big flair. Been taking this stop sign pill shaped pill for 3 weeks. It fails to do what it should do.	3	December 13, 2019	5
Acyclovir Oral Suspension	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	First out break of HSV2 at 18,  then  I had NO symptoms at all for 8 YEARS!  Then got back to back out breakouts at 26 years old for 3 months.  Started taking aciclovir 400mg twice a day as suppressive therapy and have had NO symptoms since, for three months.  Side effects minimal.  My advice is just try it because it has saved me :) x	10	December 10, 2019	16
Acyclovir Oral Suspension	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	I was diagnosed in Jan this year . But I didn’t know I had it I faintly remember years ago having a cut down there that hurt really bad . ( I think that’s when I got infected ) I’ve been on the acyclovir med coming up on year now. I still get outbreaks frequently.. nothing is working I also have PCOS .

Acyclovir Oral Suspension	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	I wasn't told by my sexual partner that they had herpes, I got very ill & was having reproductive problems at the time. I had a few blister type spots and I went to the doctors got acyclovir and it went within 2 days and it's been over a month or 2 now and it hasn't come back.

Acyclovir Oral Suspension	Herpes Simplex	Prescribed for cold sore outbreaks, three 400mg  tabs per day, took for 2 days; my heart is racing, cannot concentrate, blood pressure 157/91, my blood pressure was 120/74 two days prior to using this medication, a general feeling of unwellness, 		August 28, 2019	16
Acyclovir Oral Suspension	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	I ended up misdiagnosed on several occasions with what felt like a uti and or thrush. After five days of agony and burning fever I knew something was wrong. I had one sore which experts misdiagnosed as a cyst. Finally a GP confirmed my worst fears. An STD in my thirties. I can still count my encounters on one hand but anyone that has sex risk takes the virus and I was just unlucky. I was lucky my partner who was a week into our relationship was so supportive. I take acyclovir as a preventative medication to avoid more breakouts and it works a treat. I get the odd itch but no symtoms. I sometimes feel tired with it and alcohol I have to be careful with. Otherwise I really recommend it for self esteem getting back on your feet and with the whole acceptance aspect. One in six of us have it. This makes it manageable. A vaccine or cure would be better still... But out of all the illnesses and diseases this isn't the worst one.. Count the blessings x	10	August 27, 2019	49
Acyclovir Oral Suspension	Herpes Simplex	I've been using Acyclovir for some time now. Sadly I am noticing that it takes longer to work when I am having an outbreak and I am also noticing outbreaks in different places I never had them before. My hair is beginning to fall out which I was never told was a side affect. I am stressing even more having to deal with those  which is cause more frequent outbreaks.	6	August 19, 2019	13
Acyclovir Oral Suspension	Herpes Simplex	So I am 65 and haven’t had an outbreak for 4 years.    In the past couple of days I’ve had a burning sensation that comes and goes.   It’s in a different place than I’ve ever had it.   There is absolutely nothing to see, no blisters or sore.   But it is so tender I’m lying around with ice on my crotch.  My jeans shorts were painful to the area.    I have the Acyclovir on hand but how do I know if it’s a herpes outbreak.?   It almost feels like it’s bruised.  Again nothing visible.   Is this a giant outbreak waiting to surface?? Is it harmful to take a corse of it “just to be safe?		August 8, 2019	13
Acyclovir Oral Suspension	Herpes Simplex	Stress is NO good for people with HSV2 it activates the virus. I’ve had a rash for about 3 months. Until I got fed up and missed seeing my privates clean and smooth so took a trip to my gyno and she prescribed me acyclovir twice a day and it’s almost clearing up!! On my 5th day of taking the pill.	9	July 28, 2019	15
Acyclovir Oral Suspension	Herpes Simplex	Have had HSV-2 for 15 years. Take the pills on a schedule and try to avoid being stressed because this disease will never go away. Eventually you just get use to having it. Stay positive.		July 5, 2019	28
Acyclovir Oral Suspension	Herpes Simplex	I am a 30 yr old woman and I recently became diagnosed with genital herpes a few days. I started seeing a guy that didn't know he's infected with it. We had sex one of the times without a condom and BOOM here I am. I started having a burning while peeing a few days later, vaginal irritation, stomach cramping ect. I was given a RX for an UTI. 3 days later, I broke out in a few painful little bumps, and the burning in my urination got worse. Then I got a fever. I went to the ER and the doctor diagnosed me genital herpes. Luckily it's a small localized area she said, and gave me Acyclovir  400 MG to take 3x a day. I'm on the 3rd day and it's a huge difference. The site is healing, it's not burning when I urinate, no more fever, and a lot less discharge. I've gotten some side effects of being very drowsy and tired, and tingling random places. The only thing I hate is the drowsiness. I've been fighting to stay awake at work the past 2 days of it really kicking in.	10	June 27, 2019	23
Acyclovir Oral Suspension	Herpes Simplex	I became very irritated down there to the point  it hurt to go to the bathroom I schedule an appointment for the doctor and they told me I had a yeast infection I then noticed bumps down there and they tested for HSV2 (herpes simplex 2) came back positive. Currently day 3 of acyclovir and I am so happy to almost be back to myself. The pain I went through was unbearable... had to call out of work several times because I could barely walk. We will see how this medicine works for me overtime	8	June 10, 2019	18
Acyclovir Oral Suspension	Zovirax (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	I get coldsores mainly in the summer, my symptoms start of with dry and itchy lips, and then they start to blister and swell, I recommend if you have the same symptoms as me then put the Zovirax on as SOON AS POSSIBLE! The cold sore feels much better as soon as it’s on, the healing begins straight away, the blister on the mouth begins to dry out so it may feel uncomfortable, because of this I also use Carmex Lip Balm to keep my lips moisturised. I use Zovirax every time I get a cold sore and they heal much faster, for me it’s max 4 days. Amazing product and definietely worth the money!	10	April 14, 2019	8
Acyclovir Oral Suspension	Herpes Simplex	"Have had HSV2 for 30 years and take Acyclovir 400 mg for episodic outbreaks. In the ""early years"",I used Zovirax ointment, which is very good, but the tablets are betteras you take the medication early, before the dreadful outbreak, in the form of Acyclovir 400mg/2-3x daily for 3-5 days has been an unbelievable blessing. It IS a horrible disease, but Acyclovir makes it bearable."	10	April 8, 2019	13
Acyclovir Oral Suspension	Cold Sores	Summary - If you get a cold sore, use Valacyclovir and Xerese ASAP and don't stop until it is gone!!!    Details - My nose (area between the two nostrils) started getting red Tuesday morning.   I just put Neosporin on it Tuesday night.  I woke up Wed realizing it was a cold sore issue.  I was out of town and didn't have the cold sore meds with me.  I got Valacyclovir filled and immediately starting taking 2 pills in the AM and PM.  I then got Acyclovir cream filled (as Xerese was not available).  I used that cream almost every two hours.  It is very good, but not as optimal as Xerese.  I kept taking both drugs all day Wed and Thursday, even though for Valacyclovir you can stop after 1 day.  I didn't want to chance it.  I got home late Thursday from traveling and swapped out Acyclovir for Xerese.  Results - AMAZING!  All I had was a very tiny scar on Friday afternoon.		March 16, 2019	3
Acyclovir Oral Suspension	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	I was diagnosed with HSV-2 six  months ago. The guy I was seeing had told me before we slept together, and we always used condoms, but it was still transmitted. First outbreak was grim and lasted for about a month, huge blisters on my thighs rendered me unable to walk. I stopped dating for a long time because I couldn't seem to control the outbreaks, and it seemed I was getting them back-to-back every week (although they never came out as full sores, just slight itching and discomfort). I started taking suppressive acyclovir (2 x 400mg per day) after 4 months, and so far the 'outbreaks' have just been itchy with no visible sores. Though I do still get them frequently despite leading a healthy, for the most part stress-free lifestyle. I will continue to take suppressive acyclovir for the foreseeable future to see if my body can eventually adjust to the virus.	7	February 9, 2019	13
Acyclovir Oral Suspension	Herpes Simplex	When using oral and cream at onset gets rid of them fast. But remember this oral stuff  really bad on the liver. If outbreaks are like a few times a year not to worry. If down in Mexico can get for a fraction of the cost then in the states.	10	January 25, 2019	6
Acyclovir Oral Suspension	Sitavig (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	This stuff is amazing! At first it was difficult to apply to gums (it is a tablet you stick on your gums and you don't swallow it). It say sto use round side to apply to gums but I found it easier to use flat side of tablet. If you catch it in time you just get a tiny bump and it goes down by the next day. I haven't had a bad blister in over a year. Use to get them 3 to 4 times a year. Now, maybe 2. If u don't have insurance this medication will be expensive unfortunately.	9	January 19, 2019	2
Acyclovir Oral Suspension	Herpes Simplex	My fiance and I discovered, in the beginning of our relationship, that we both had genital herpes. My first outbreak was the ABSOLUTE worst experience, I was so sick. We suffered for 2 years, had constant breakouts and then finally we decided to both respectively take acyclovir. Doses are 800 mg tablet every day, and honest to goodness it was a miracle drug. We have been on it for 3 months now and except for an occasional itch here and there that lasts for a day and then goes away, neither of us have had the lesions or the terrible symptoms. We do not take it when we feel symptoms; instead, we take 800mg every day, possibly for the rest of our lives but that's okay so long as we never have to experience another outbreak!!	10	December 5, 2018	20
Acyclovir Oral Suspension	Cold Sores	Its no exaggeration that cold sores on my lips has in a way, been ruining my life. It has ended relationships, and I've learned to become ashamed. I had a boyfriend in high school who kissed me with one and now I get them several times a year, and in the winter its back to back. Its horrible.  But this drug is a life saver. I wake up with mine, no tingles. I blast them instantly with 2 at a time ever few hours, and by the end of the night the blisters will cease. What took a week to two weeks to heal now only takes days, sometimes its not even noticeable at all. I now take this everyday to prevent outbreaks. This is a huge relief in my life. I recommend for anyone who suffers like me!	10	November 29, 2018	18

Acyclovir Oral Suspension	Cold Sores	I'm a 35 year old female who has suffered from cold sores for so long I have pictures of me as a 3 year old with them, almost every year book picture, me with a cold sore. Every period, stressed, every Holiday. I was prescribed Acyclovir at 33 years old after giving birth to my first child. I had an outbreak and worried about my son catching the virus from me (Herpes is dangerous/deadly for infants) as my mother was so irresponsible when I caught it young. It's amazing, I remember thinking as a small child If given 3 wishes, one would be never get Cold sores again. I'd been on it and hadn't experienced one in almost 2 years. I'm very grateful l I'd never experienced ocular or genital herpes and have great sympathy for those who do. Acyclovir is a miracle for me	10	September 30, 2018	11
Acyclovir Oral Suspension	Cold Sores	I use this drug for the occasional cold sore that I get on and/or around my mouth. I live in Mexico and found this drug over the counter. Super sad to hear the cream costs $200 !! Here a 5g tube and 50 tabs of 400 mg tablets cost me a whopping $7 USD. I have a few different tubes so I can have it available if I ever feel a tingle.  And since it’s so cheap if I see even a stranger with a cold sore I offer it to them. It is a miracle worker for me. If I am fortunate enough to catch it in time to take a pill it rarely goes to a full blister. And if it does it is contained to a very slight bump. For me it also relieves any discomfort.	10	September 19, 2018	6
Acyclovir Oral Suspension	Herpes Simplex	After trying A LOT of different things Acyclovir is definitely what you need to be taking ASAP. As soon as you feel any tingling at all. If you are unfortunate enough to have reached the weeping sores phase I found the only thing to soothe the pain was salt water with black tea. Pop a tea bag in with hot very salty water and cleanse your intimate area once cool enough. Sounds mad but you'll thank me after!	8	September 5, 2018	15
Acyclovir Oral Suspension	Herpes Zoster	I had  herpes zoster in April 2017, was  prescribed   acyclovir 400mg x2  with anti-allergic tabs  for seven days and  was cured  although  after-effects were felt for long.   Interestingly,  I also got rid of another medical condition that had been  bothering me for more than a year prior to the  herpes   attack.  After one year,  symptoms of  old  problem (not herpes) developed again.  I told  doctor about the effect  acyclovir tabs had on it a year ago.  But the doctor laughed away  my observations  and  prescribed  other medicines.  When  I didn't get  relief even after my third visit to her, she reluctantly prescribed acyclovir tabs.  I was completely cured after eight days. Before going public with full details,   I would like to share it with  manufacturers of acyclovir tabs.  They may like to initiate some more research on this wonderful drug and arrive at a definitive conclusion vis-a-vis my observations.    I may  offer myself for  clinical trials, if necessary.	10	August 19, 2018	8
Acyclovir Oral Suspension	Zovirax (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	Took one ten day course of this anti-viral over seven years ago and have never had even a hint of another fever blister symptom ever since.

Acyclovir Oral Suspension	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	My first outbreak was horrific. I could not walk for a week the pain was so unbearable. I laid in bed the whole time with cold packs between my legs and dreaded when having to use the bathroom because the pain was excruciating. I started this medication 4 days after I was infected and had symptoms. It did help and I have been on it for a couple of months now and no side effects. My doctor wants me to be on it for 2 years for suppressive therapy and then try to get off of it. She did inform me however that if I had several outbreaks, she had no problem putting me back on it. She assured me it was safe longterm. There have been times I have forgotten to take my meds and within a few days I have some symptoms, but then I start back up again and in a few days, I am feeling better. This medicine truly allows me to forget that I have HSV-2, other than when I take my meds. It’s been a miracle for me.	10	March 25, 2018	14
Acyclovir Oral Suspension	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	I've had fever blisters since I was a child. When I was a teenager I got fever blisters a lot.  As I got older usually just in the summer. About 4 years  ago I was getting them every other month. Dr put me on 400mg twice daily. Have not had any in the last year and a half.  What a difference its made in my life!	10	March 25, 2018	5

Acyclovir Oral Suspension	Cold Sores	16 years ago I was accidentally poked in my eye. The following day my eye flared up  very inflamed and painful. I was diagnosed  with viral keratitis (cold sore virus in the eye).  About 5 years later they finally put me on zovirax  tablets 800mg. I found them great. Didn't take long for to clear it up  while also using zovirax  eye ointment  I have had less breakouts over the years compared to the 3 or 4 a year I had been experiencing before be I got prescribed this. These tablets were the answer to my prayers as it's extremely painful when I have an outbreak in my eyes. I currently have an outbreak and my doctor has me on 400mg five times a day as well as  the eye ointment. I've found with this medication the breakouts are less  frequent and the symptoms less severe. Also this  is free for me as it's cover by medical card which is great. No side effects. For me I would highly recommend  zovirax aka adviclor  to anyone  wanting to treat an outbreak	10	February 23, 2018	3
Acyclovir Oral Suspension	Herpes Simplex	For the last year I've been plagued with severe cold sore/herpes outbreaks around my lips, chin and nose. A never ending cycle of breakout, heal, breakout. After one day of using the cream and Acyclovir the large bump on the side of my lip flattened to the point of not noticing it. Day six and I haven't seen my face look this clear in years. One little teeny whitehead popped up last night below my lip but you can't tell its a herpes sore.  It kind of seemed like a final whimper. If I could rate prior breakouts as a 10 for worst case scenario, this little guy would be a 1. And I'd even thank someone for it. One last thing, If you're insured look around for community health centers, call them and ask for a low cost pharmacy to fill your prescription. I've read online the same Zovirax cream prescription goes for $200, and Acyclovir anywhere from $80-200. I paid $100 for both. Do some research!	10	February 19, 2018	5

Acyclovir Oral Suspension	Herpes Simplex	I had HSV-2 in my 20s.  My doctor gave me a strong prescription of Zyclovair and I think it was for 30 days.  I never had an outbreak again.  The outbreak that I was seen for, was my first and only one and it was really quite bad.  Now I am 49 without a herpes outbreak following the treatment.	10	January 16, 2018	32
Acyclovir Oral Suspension	Herpes Simplex	I’ve been having cold sores since I was 12 on my lips and face. I tried everything and nothing would work. My doctor prescribed me this when he realized how serious it was. I was getting them sometimes one right after the other one!  I’m supposed to take one gram a day, but I found that when I did that I still got them frequently. So I only take it when I feel a tingle , I take about 4 and it never comes out. What sucks is when I don’t get the tingle and I just wake up with a full blow on sore/sores. Overall medicine really helps though! Completely free with my insurance as well!	7	October 22, 2017	2

Acyclovir Oral Suspension	Cold Sores	My experience is that I have had cold sores ONLY on my lips from age 6 to 35. I agreed to a 1st date...bam! I felt it. That is the key; take meds once 1st felt. I have no medical knowledge except I know what my body tolerates and what has been successful which may not be your best bet but be safe careful and consult you Dr b4 any treatment plan.  1. break up your pills in half for immediate absorbtion take 800mg every 2 hours to slam your system to alert it there's an issue and send in a 2nd round of 800 within 1st 4 hours 2. continue 800 for 2 days every 4 hours 3. apply Abreva or similar product on the sore at first sensation, while taking the meds so you are attacking the infection from inside (meds) and externally (creme on sore) 4 days	9	August 23, 2017	8

Acyclovir Oral Suspension	Herpes Simplex	I'm 48 and I was diagnosed with genital herpes when I was 35. I started dating a new guy and within 2 weeks I felt horrible burning when I urinated. I went to my midwives and sure enough I had herpes. Funny thing is I wasn't with anyone prior to him and I was with him for 6 years and not once did he ever test positive. They actually claim I could have had it on my face touched it and touched my genitals without washing my hands and transferred it. The outbreaks are less and less over the years but when I feel one coming I take acyclovir 500mg 2x daily. It helps right away. And I use a squirt bottle with warm water as I urinated to help reduce the burning.	10	July 1, 2017	21
Acyclovir Oral Suspension	Herpes Simplex	Good day to every one reading this, I am here to give my testimony about a  herbal doctor  called dr tokubo who helped me in my life. I was infected with HERPES SIMPLEX virus in 2015, i went to many hospitals for cure and they told me there was no solution for it, so I was thinking how i can  get a solution so that my body can be okay. One day I was in the river side thinking where I can go to get solution, Along the line a lady walked to me telling me why am I so sad and i open up all to her telling her my problem, she told me that she can help me out, she introduce me to a doctor who uses herbal medication to cure HERPES SIMPLEX virus and gave me his email, so i mail him to order for his herbal medicine.

Acyclovir Oral Suspension	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	I have found that acyclovir works better for me when I take pine cone extract. I believe this extract works as an adjuvant, increases the potency of this antiviral drug.  I have been using this combination for several years and have had only two outbreaks in 3 years apposed to 3-4 a year when only using acyclovir 400 mg daily. This makes me believe that the extract is working.  Research suggests that certain compounds found in pine cone extract increases specific Dendritic immune cells.	8	June 1, 2017	14

Acyclovir Oral Suspension	Herpes Simplex	I found out I contracted genital herpes from an ex boyfriend about 5 years ago. It initially felt like a cut on my vagina that itched and burned. Went to Dr next day and sure enough- herpes (ugh). I take the medicine as needed and it works like a charm. If I do feel one coming I take 400mg  three day for about 4-5 days. Clears right up. I also used to get cold sore a few times a year- haven't since taking this medicine. It's AMAZING. Just wish I never had to find out about it.	9	April 5, 2017	25
Acyclovir Oral Suspension	Herpes Simplex	At 29 weeks pregnant I had a fever. Thought I was leaking amniotic fluid. Went to the hospital and misdiagnosed with a UTI. Stayed overnight with IVF and antibiotics and checked, monitored and ultrasound before discharged the following day. 24 hours later still not having felt well went back to the hospital and rechecked, water broke dilated to 2 and Dr said she didn't think of it before, but was going to test and treat me for Genital Herpes.

Acyclovir Oral Suspension	Herpes Simplex	About 5 days ago I realized a cut, I thought I had cut myself while shaving... it then got very uncomfortable and burned while I urinated. Finally, I took my camera down there and wanted to look... I noticed a few more cuts  that look like canker sores so I made an appointment right away. She told me it looked like genital herpes. She gave my the cream and the pills. It's only been a day and it doesn't feel like it's working. I know it's soon. But I still feel like I'm on fire, I'm itchy, and it still burns like crazy. Is there anything else I can do?	2	March 29, 2017	17
Acyclovir Oral Suspension	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	I have found this drug to be very effective in controlling my IBS/ inflammatory bowel disease.  Clearly it's possible herpes has a role to play in these conditions.	9	March 7, 2017	12
Acyclovir Oral Suspension	Herpes Simplex	This is the only thing that works for myself stress induced break outs (college). I use both the pills and the cream. I believe when I first started using acyclovir it was more effective  and now it can take a good 4-5 days to fully heal. This is nothing in comparison to a cold sore that lasted a month without the meds though! 400mg. Free with my healthcare for the pills, the cream was $25.	9	February 22, 2017	8
Acyclovir Tablets	Cold Sores	I have taken acyclovir sporadically for the last two years. My blood cell count was low so I was forced to go off it for a number of months after beginning treatment. I resumed taking it two months ago and I must admit it has been very good. Before beginning acyclovir I had only 1-2 obs but almost constant nerve pain in the anal region. It had been like this (undiagnosed despite numerous doctor's visits) for around 17 years. After acyclovir began and then stopped because of blood cell count, it was however infinitely worse. I had permanent obs and permanent nerve pain in the anal region, and now I had permanent nerve pain in my vaginal area. my doctor originally prescribed me 400mg twice a day but I found I need to take it 3 times a day in order to quell the obs. I am hoping that in another 10-24 months it will be cured but I am suspending my belief as yet.	7	March 13, 2021	0
Acyclovir Tablets	Herpes Simplex	Every few years it occurs, always keep it in reserve because if you are fast enough, a single 800mg can stop it in its tracks, maybe 2 or 3 just to be sure..	10	March 12, 2021	4

Acyclovir Tablets	Herpes Zoster	I took Acyclovir because of shingles, I had to take 800mg 5x a day for 7 days. On the first day I was okay, second day I felt dizzy and a little  nauseous, third day I had severe nausea! Which was horrible!

Acyclovir Tablets	Herpes Simplex	My child caught rash on skin. I don’t know where she came in contact with it. We had been on vacations and she was in swimming. It comes back often times every two months. It stays longer when acyclovir is used. I used the cream and the oral liquid and it the outbreak lasted for a long time and it comes back as soon as treatment stops. I’m currently trying essential oils and it clears up faster but I don’t know about the recurrences yet.	1	December 5, 2020	0
Acyclovir Tablets	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	I don't know how I got infected with genital herpes - I was with someone who didn't have it so can only assume it had laid dormant for a number of years when someone else had given it to me. The first outbreak was 10 years ago, but was just an itchy spot in my pubic area close to my panty line. The second outbreak came a month or so later and was just a couple of blisters. When I was diagnosed, my whole world collapsed. I was in therapy for 2 years, it really hit me hard. I've taken acyclovir twice a day since then. I haven't had an outbreak but some days I still get the tingling and ache around my pubic area. On those days, I get very low and upset. I may try a different drug.	8	November 14, 2020	6
Acyclovir Tablets	Herpes Simplex	I think it worked okay within 3 days my breakout was gone. But I don't like that you have to take it 3 times daily for a week straight then keep taking it for prevention if you get breakouts because I forget half the time. It makes me really sick if I don't eat and I have celiac disease so if you can't eat much like I can't this isn't the right kind for you. Because it's not the right one for me and the pill itself is huge looks like a dungeon and dragon symbol	9	October 31, 2020	1
Acyclovir Tablets	Herpes Simplex	I'm 74 years old. First diagnosed 40 years ago so I've been using  Zovirax and acyclovir cream a while. Both have been effective in eliminating or reducing outbreaks. Especially if applied at very first signs of oncoming event. I haven't had a cold sore in that time because I apply the cream when I feel any tingling or raised skin surface. Very little cream is needed to be effective but, several applications a day works best.	10	September 24, 2020	7
Acyclovir Tablets	Sitavig (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	I’ve been getting cold sores once-twice a year for the last 5 years. I do not get a small blister that turns my lip slightly red. When one emerges, it is so large and painful that one entire side of lip is completely swollen. It can be so unsightly and painful for those two weeks that I typically don’t leave the house. I’ve always taken Valtrex as quickly as possible upon feeling symptoms and haven’t found it to be effective. The Sitavig, however, has been a godsend. I applied it upon first notice of a small blister forming. The blister still appeared but is small enough that you can’t really see it unless you know what you’re looking for. There is no swelling and very, very little discomfort (slight itching). I’m only on day 2 of the sore and already it’s shrunk. Highly recommend for anyone who gets large, painful cold sores.	8	September 15, 2020	2
Acyclovir Tablets	Herpes Simplex	I was diagnosed with herpes this year after getting it from my partner. I had a fairly bad first outbreak on my inner labia and just presumed it to be from shaving but I went to a sexual health clinic and got diagnosed. This medicine has been so helpful anytime I have a tingling/throbbing sensation I take it and it works wonders. I’m currently taking it at the moment and the only real side effect I have is having a headache!		July 29, 2020	7
Acyclovir Tablets	Herpes Simplex	I am 43 I just recently got diagnosed with HSV2 with two previous false negative tests. It sucks not 2 know when and where you got the infection from I've never seen any breakouts on any 1 I've been with but I'm seeing you can contract this even with a condom. I have breakouts in more than 1 place inner labial outer labial which I thought was a ingrown hair infection.  Also have a breakout in the anal area but mostly the upper part of the crack which is weird. I hate this. I've been with my bf for 7 yrs he said he had a cold sore before but I don't think he gave it to me by me having 2 false tests. I'm so ashamed as I'd rather have had gonorrhea or chlamydia if I had to suffer from a STD as you can get rid of those. I haven't been able to share this news with my boyfriend as I'm afraid how he may react, he has really tripping about this COVID virus . But I may have had this 4 awhile and luckily I've never transmitted it and this is my first time with an actual blisters.	7	May 22, 2020	18
Acyclovir Tablets	Herpes Simplex	My child came in contact on va cction and has a skin rash HSV-1 and this medicine does not work at all for her. I hate to see her so irritated I wish there was an actual cure. I used vinegar and coconut oils and it took just as long to clear as this drug..	1	May 20, 2020	2
Acyclovir Tablets	Herpes Simplex	Started taking this after an outbreak. Thought the first one was just irritation from a wax. Realized after that second time it happened that it was definitely herpes and triggered by bikini waxing. Now take this daily to suppress and have not had an outbreak since (over a year). Have found it definitely has caused me to have increased sweating at night, which is annoying, but otherwise no issues.	10	May 11, 2020	7
Acyclovir Tablets	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	I had itching for 3 months before my first HSV-2 lesion appeared. It was very mild but I had the fever, swollen lymph nodes and intense burning. I took Acyclovir for 5 days which reduced my symptoms quickly. I am now on 400mg twice daily for suppression, however I still get the odd itch here and there.	9	April 22, 2020	9
Acyclovir Tablets	Herpes Simplex	I was getting many cold sores every year. I would take Acyclovir as soon as the numbness started. It never shortened the duration; never had any effect on the pain. The cold sores just kept getting worse. The doctor finally put me on a stronger anti-viral. It did nothing either. I only got headaches from the anti-virals. I finally decided to try vitamin D. I haven't had a cold sore in at least 2 years.	1	April 19, 2020	15
Acyclovir Tablets	Herpes Simplex	I was prescribed this meds and it did work, years later I'm still battling with this virus, I never gave it on to anyone, anytime I feel discomfort I call my dr to send a script to the pharmacy. I have had a outbreak on different parts of my vagina and by my anus & mouth. The ones that comes by my vulvar or anus is the worst especially when I urinate I always have that cup of water to pour while I urinate so it wouldn't burn.I'm having an outbreak now I been feeling this itch & painful feeling that got me up. I took a pill about 30 min ago I can honestly tell you Im feeling the med kick in. My pill is 500mg I try to keep some on hands for times like this my dr is close.	10	April 12, 2020	3
Acyclovir Tablets	Herpes Zoster	I have herpes zoster (shingles)in  internal, inner ear. Damage to both trigeminal and occipital nerve. Facial paralysis. This medicine possibly saved my life, and the capsule form worked much better than the tablet form for me. It does give me some side effects such as an upset stomach and a weird energizing feeling (less with capsule for me), but if you truly need the medicine, please take it. This virus, if left untreated, can destroy your health and well-being and possibly kill you. Do not underestimate what it can do to your body.	10	April 2, 2020	9
Acyclovir Tablets	Herpes Zoster	Relieved my itching and rash after 1 1/2 days	9	February 26, 2020	6
Acyclovir Tablets	Herpes Simplex	I had back to back outbreaks after 8 years of no outbreaks at all. I take two 400mg tablets of aciclovir a day and I have not had an outbreak since. It has honestly saved my life. I forget I even carry the virus (I told my partner when we got together) and we have unprotected sex and have not passed it on (I have never transmitted to a partner)  TRY THE MEDS THEY WORK.. thank god	10	February 10, 2020	33
Acyclovir Tablets	Herpes Zoster	Discovered I had shingles after reading the Google medical journal lol. Started with mysterious left leg flu like feeling, and excruciating burning pain almost to tears on my left butt cheek. Then bumps on my butt. Decided to take monolaurin (dietary supplement) 3-3x/day for 2 days instead of going to dr. I had no pain and rash was going away. I caved and went to dr to get an Rx of an antiviral so I wouldn’t get post neuralgia. After taking for 2 days I now realize it’s messing with my head. It’s making me feel hopeless and no interest. I am going to discontinue and hope for the best. I will continue with Monolaurin as I think it helped stave off additional outbreaks.	1	February 9, 2020	6
Acyclovir Tablets	Herpes Simplex	I had a rash on my hand that my doctor thought (misdiagnosed) was the shingles. I was prescribed acyclovir and I had a severe allergic reaction. It turns out it was Dyshidrosis (pompholyx) blisters on your hands from stress. Chickenpox/shingles are viral, you do not need to take anything except pain medication. I suffered with hives all over my body the size of dinner plates, it felt like I was being burned alive. I was throwing up, lost weight and my skin/face began to show signs of jaundice. I thought I maybe fatal at one point, my skin began to thin to the point I was seeing the coloration of muscle underneath. I still have scars from it. I had these terrible hives for three months until I was given a steroid shot and montelukast. It was a terrible allergic reaction and this medication is known to cause Steven Johnsons Syndrome (SJS), google it because it is terrifying. The hives were gone in 24 hours after getting steroid shot. Do not take this medication, you could get SJS which can be  the end of your life  or ruin your life.		December 29, 2019	7
Acyclovir Tablets	Varicella-Zoster	Stuff did absolutely nothing to me . Had to rely on painkillers. That little body lotion is only made to give you hope	1	December 26, 2019	0
Acyclovir Tablets	Herpes Zoster	The acyclovir from Camber Drug Co. and shaped like a stop sign don't work very well. The last ones I had from another company worked just fine. But now  I feel like I'm on the start of a big flair. Been taking this stop sign pill shaped pill for 3 weeks. It fails to do what it should do.	3	December 13, 2019	5
Acyclovir Tablets	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	First out break of HSV2 at 18,  then  I had NO symptoms at all for 8 YEARS!  Then got back to back out breakouts at 26 years old for 3 months.  Started taking aciclovir 400mg twice a day as suppressive therapy and have had NO symptoms since, for three months.  Side effects minimal.  My advice is just try it because it has saved me :) x	10	December 10, 2019	16
Acyclovir Tablets	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	I was diagnosed in Jan this year . But I didn’t know I had it I faintly remember years ago having a cut down there that hurt really bad . ( I think that’s when I got infected ) I’ve been on the acyclovir med coming up on year now. I still get outbreaks frequently.. nothing is working I also have PCOS . I have hsv1 & 2 but never had an outbreak on my mouth . I’ll get little bumps on my nose .	3	December 3, 2019	3
Acyclovir Tablets	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	I wasn't told by my sexual partner that they had herpes, I got very ill & was having reproductive problems at the time. I had a few blister type spots and I went to the doctors got acyclovir and it went within 2 days and it's been over a month or 2 now and it hasn't come back.  But he went and continued infecting unsuspecting women.  I'm 21	10	October 12, 2019	11
Acyclovir Tablets	Herpes Simplex	Prescribed for cold sore outbreaks, three 400mg  tabs per day, took for 2 days; my heart is racing, cannot concentrate, blood pressure 157/91, my blood pressure was 120/74 two days prior to using this medication, a general feeling of unwellness, 		August 28, 2019	16
Acyclovir Tablets	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	I ended up misdiagnosed on several occasions with what felt like a uti and or thrush. After five days of agony and burning fever I knew something was wrong. I had one sore which experts misdiagnosed as a cyst. Finally a GP confirmed my worst fears. An STD in my thirties. I can still count my encounters on one hand but anyone that has sex risk takes the virus and I was just unlucky. I was lucky my partner who was a week into our relationship was so supportive. I take acyclovir as a preventative medication to avoid more breakouts and it works a treat. I get the odd itch but no symtoms. I sometimes feel tired with it and alcohol I have to be careful with. Otherwise I really recommend it for self esteem getting back on your feet and with the whole acceptance aspect. One in six of us have it. This makes it manageable. A vaccine or cure would be better still... But out of all the illnesses and diseases this isn't the worst one.. Count the blessings x	10	August 27, 2019	49
Acyclovir Tablets	Herpes Simplex	I've been using Acyclovir for some time now. Sadly I am noticing that it takes longer to work when I am having an outbreak and I am also noticing outbreaks in different places I never had them before. My hair is beginning to fall out which I was never told was a side affect. I am stressing even more having to deal with those  which is cause more frequent outbreaks.	6	August 19, 2019	13
Acyclovir Tablets	Herpes Simplex	So I am 65 and haven’t had an outbreak for 4 years.    In the past couple of days I’ve had a burning sensation that comes and goes.   It’s in a different place than I’ve ever had it.   There is absolutely nothing to see, no blisters or sore.   But it is so tender I’m lying around with ice on my crotch.  My jeans shorts were painful to the area.    I have the Acyclovir on hand but how do I know if it’s a herpes outbreak.?   It almost feels like it’s bruised.  Again nothing visible.   Is this a giant outbreak waiting to surface?? Is it harmful to take a corse of it “just to be safe?		August 8, 2019	13
Acyclovir Tablets	Herpes Simplex	Stress is NO good for people with HSV2 it activates the virus. I’ve had a rash for about 3 months. Until I got fed up and missed seeing my privates clean and smooth so took a trip to my gyno and she prescribed me acyclovir twice a day and it’s almost clearing up!! On my 5th day of taking the pill.	9	July 28, 2019	15
Acyclovir Tablets	Herpes Simplex	Have had HSV-2 for 15 years. Take the pills on a schedule and try to avoid being stressed because this disease will never go away. Eventually you just get use to having it. Stay positive.		July 5, 2019	28
Acyclovir Tablets	Herpes Simplex	I am a 30 yr old woman and I recently became diagnosed with genital herpes a few days. I started seeing a guy that didn't know he's infected with it. We had sex one of the times without a condom and BOOM here I am. I started having a burning while peeing a few days later, vaginal irritation, stomach cramping ect. I was given a RX for an UTI. 3 days later, I broke out in a few painful little bumps, and the burning in my urination got worse. Then I got a fever. I went to the ER and the doctor diagnosed me genital herpes. Luckily it's a small localized area she said, and gave me Acyclovir  400 MG to take 3x a day. I'm on the 3rd day and it's a huge difference. The site is healing, it's not burning when I urinate, no more fever, and a lot less discharge. I've gotten some side effects of being very drowsy and tired, and tingling random places. The only thing I hate is the drowsiness. I've been fighting to stay awake at work the past 2 days of it really kicking in.	10	June 27, 2019	23
Acyclovir Tablets	Herpes Simplex	I became very irritated down there to the point  it hurt to go to the bathroom I schedule an appointment for the doctor and they told me I had a yeast infection I then noticed bumps down there and they tested for HSV2 (herpes simplex 2) came back positive. Currently day 3 of acyclovir and I am so happy to almost be back to myself. The pain I went through was unbearable... had to call out of work several times because I could barely walk. We will see how this medicine works for me overtime	8	June 10, 2019	18
Acyclovir Tablets	Zovirax (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	I get coldsores mainly in the summer, my symptoms start of with dry and itchy lips, and then they start to blister and swell, I recommend if you have the same symptoms as me then put the Zovirax on as SOON AS POSSIBLE! The cold sore feels much better as soon as it’s on, the healing begins straight away, the blister on the mouth begins to dry out so it may feel uncomfortable, because of this I also use Carmex Lip Balm to keep my lips moisturised. I use Zovirax every time I get a cold sore and they heal much faster, for me it’s max 4 days. Amazing product and definietely worth the money!	10	April 14, 2019	8
Acyclovir Tablets	Herpes Simplex	"Have had HSV2 for 30 years and take Acyclovir 400 mg for episodic outbreaks. In the ""early years"",I used Zovirax ointment, which is very good, but the tablets are betteras you take the medication early, before the dreadful outbreak, in the form of Acyclovir 400mg/2-3x daily for 3-5 days has been an unbelievable blessing. It IS a horrible disease, but Acyclovir makes it bearable."	10	April 8, 2019	13
Acyclovir Tablets	Cold Sores	Summary - If you get a cold sore, use Valacyclovir and Xerese ASAP and don't stop until it is gone!!!    Details - My nose (area between the two nostrils) started getting red Tuesday morning.   I just put Neosporin on it Tuesday night.  I woke up Wed realizing it was a cold sore issue.  I was out of town and didn't have the cold sore meds with me.  I got Valacyclovir filled and immediately starting taking 2 pills in the AM and PM.  I then got Acyclovir cream filled (as Xerese was not available).  I used that cream almost every two hours.  It is very good, but not as optimal as Xerese.  I kept taking both drugs all day Wed and Thursday, even though for Valacyclovir you can stop after 1 day.  I didn't want to chance it.  I got home late Thursday from traveling and swapped out Acyclovir for Xerese.  Results - AMAZING!  All I had was a very tiny scar on Friday afternoon.		March 16, 2019	3
Acyclovir Tablets	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	I was diagnosed with HSV-2 six  months ago. The guy I was seeing had told me before we slept together, and we always used condoms, but it was still transmitted. First outbreak was grim and lasted for about a month, huge blisters on my thighs rendered me unable to walk. I stopped dating for a long time because I couldn't seem to control the outbreaks, and it seemed I was getting them back-to-back every week (although they never came out as full sores, just slight itching and discomfort). I started taking suppressive acyclovir (2 x 400mg per day) after 4 months, and so far the 'outbreaks' have just been itchy with no visible sores. Though I do still get them frequently despite leading a healthy, for the most part stress-free lifestyle. I will continue to take suppressive acyclovir for the foreseeable future to see if my body can eventually adjust to the virus.	7	February 9, 2019	13
Acyclovir Tablets	Herpes Simplex	When using oral and cream at onset gets rid of them fast. But remember this oral stuff  really bad on the liver. If outbreaks are like a few times a year not to worry. If down in Mexico can get for a fraction of the cost then in the states.	10	January 25, 2019	6
Acyclovir Tablets	Sitavig (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	This stuff is amazing! At first it was difficult to apply to gums (it is a tablet you stick on your gums and you don't swallow it). It say sto use round side to apply to gums but I found it easier to use flat side of tablet. If you catch it in time you just get a tiny bump and it goes down by the next day. I haven't had a bad blister in over a year. Use to get them 3 to 4 times a year. Now, maybe 2. If u don't have insurance this medication will be expensive unfortunately.	9	January 19, 2019	2
Acyclovir Tablets	Herpes Simplex	My fiance and I discovered, in the beginning of our relationship, that we both had genital herpes. My first outbreak was the ABSOLUTE worst experience, I was so sick. We suffered for 2 years, had constant breakouts and then finally we decided to both respectively take acyclovir. Doses are 800 mg tablet every day, and honest to goodness it was a miracle drug. We have been on it for 3 months now and except for an occasional itch here and there that lasts for a day and then goes away, neither of us have had the lesions or the terrible symptoms. We do not take it when we feel symptoms; instead, we take 800mg every day, possibly for the rest of our lives but that's okay so long as we never have to experience another outbreak!!	10	December 5, 2018	20
Acyclovir Tablets	Cold Sores	Its no exaggeration that cold sores on my lips has in a way, been ruining my life. It has ended relationships, and I've learned to become ashamed. I had a boyfriend in high school who kissed me with one and now I get them several times a year, and in the winter its back to back. Its horrible.  But this drug is a life saver. I wake up with mine, no tingles. I blast them instantly with 2 at a time ever few hours, and by the end of the night the blisters will cease. What took a week to two weeks to heal now only takes days, sometimes its not even noticeable at all. I now take this everyday to prevent outbreaks. This is a huge relief in my life. I recommend for anyone who suffers like me!	10	November 29, 2018	18
Acyclovir Tablets	Herpes Simplex	taking 400mg once a day works for me to prevent outbreaks		October 30, 2018	7
Acyclovir Tablets	Cold Sores	I'm a 35 year old female who has suffered from cold sores for so long I have pictures of me as a 3 year old with them, almost every year book picture, me with a cold sore. Every period, stressed, every Holiday. I was prescribed Acyclovir at 33 years old after giving birth to my first child. I had an outbreak and worried about my son catching the virus from me (Herpes is dangerous/deadly for infants) as my mother was so irresponsible when I caught it young. It's amazing, I remember thinking as a small child If given 3 wishes, one would be never get Cold sores again. I'd been on it and hadn't experienced one in almost 2 years. I'm very grateful l I'd never experienced ocular or genital herpes and have great sympathy for those who do. Acyclovir is a miracle for me	10	September 30, 2018	11
Acyclovir Tablets	Cold Sores	I use this drug for the occasional cold sore that I get on and/or around my mouth. I live in Mexico and found this drug over the counter. Super sad to hear the cream costs $200 !! Here a 5g tube and 50 tabs of 400 mg tablets cost me a whopping $7 USD. I have a few different tubes so I can have it available if I ever feel a tingle.  And since it’s so cheap if I see even a stranger with a cold sore I offer it to them. It is a miracle worker for me. If I am fortunate enough to catch it in time to take a pill it rarely goes to a full blister. And if it does it is contained to a very slight bump. For me it also relieves any discomfort.	10	September 19, 2018	6
Acyclovir Tablets	Herpes Simplex	After trying A LOT of different things Acyclovir is definitely what you need to be taking ASAP. As soon as you feel any tingling at all. If you are unfortunate enough to have reached the weeping sores phase I found the only thing to soothe the pain was salt water with black tea. Pop a tea bag in with hot very salty water and cleanse your intimate area once cool enough. Sounds mad but you'll thank me after!	8	September 5, 2018	15
Acyclovir Tablets	Herpes Zoster	I had  herpes zoster in April 2017, was  prescribed   acyclovir 400mg x2  with anti-allergic tabs  for seven days and  was cured  although  after-effects were felt for long.   Interestingly,  I also got rid of another medical condition that had been  bothering me for more than a year prior to the  herpes   attack.  After one year,  symptoms of  old  problem (not herpes) developed again.  I told  doctor about the effect  acyclovir tabs had on it a year ago.  But the doctor laughed away  my observations  and  prescribed  other medicines.  When  I didn't get  relief even after my third visit to her, she reluctantly prescribed acyclovir tabs.  I was completely cured after eight days. Before going public with full details,   I would like to share it with  manufacturers of acyclovir tabs.  They may like to initiate some more research on this wonderful drug and arrive at a definitive conclusion vis-a-vis my observations.    I may  offer myself for  clinical trials, if necessary.	10	August 19, 2018	8
Acyclovir Tablets	Zovirax (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	Took one ten day course of this anti-viral over seven years ago and have never had even a hint of another fever blister symptom ever since.   I felt better after first week, and remarkably stronger after completing  the 10 day prescription . Next best thing to a cure.	9	July 9, 2018	15
Acyclovir Tablets	Cold Sores	This medication is great! I can't believe it works so fast.. I  will definitely recommend it!	10	May 20, 2018	6
Acyclovir Tablets	Herpes Simplex	Great drug .. it’s a shame the cream is so expensive. Tablet for relatively inexpensive. Why is the ointment so expensive?		May 6, 2018	5
Acyclovir Tablets	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	My first outbreak was horrific. I could not walk for a week the pain was so unbearable. I laid in bed the whole time with cold packs between my legs and dreaded when having to use the bathroom because the pain was excruciating. I started this medication 4 days after I was infected and had symptoms. It did help and I have been on it for a couple of months now and no side effects. My doctor wants me to be on it for 2 years for suppressive therapy and then try to get off of it. She did inform me however that if I had several outbreaks, she had no problem putting me back on it. She assured me it was safe longterm. There have been times I have forgotten to take my meds and within a few days I have some symptoms, but then I start back up again and in a few days, I am feeling better. This medicine truly allows me to forget that I have HSV-2, other than when I take my meds. It’s been a miracle for me.	10	March 25, 2018	14
Acyclovir Tablets	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	I've had fever blisters since I was a child. When I was a teenager I got fever blisters a lot.  As I got older usually just in the summer. About 4 years  ago I was getting them every other month. Dr put me on 400mg twice daily. Have not had any in the last year and a half.  What a difference its made in my life!	10	March 25, 2018	5
Acyclovir Tablets	Sitavig (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	Works wonders, but takes a full 24 hours of awkwardly sitting on my gums before dissolving.	8	March 9, 2018	4
Acyclovir Tablets	Cold Sores	16 years ago I was accidentally poked in my eye. The following day my eye flared up  very inflamed and painful. I was diagnosed  with viral keratitis (cold sore virus in the eye).  About 5 years later they finally put me on zovirax  tablets 800mg. I found them great. Didn't take long for to clear it up  while also using zovirax  eye ointment  I have had less breakouts over the years compared to the 3 or 4 a year I had been experiencing before be I got prescribed this. These tablets were the answer to my prayers as it's extremely painful when I have an outbreak in my eyes. I currently have an outbreak and my doctor has me on 400mg five times a day as well as  the eye ointment. I've found with this medication the breakouts are less  frequent and the symptoms less severe. Also this  is free for me as it's cover by medical card which is great. No side effects. For me I would highly recommend  zovirax aka adviclor  to anyone  wanting to treat an outbreak	10	February 23, 2018	3
Acyclovir Tablets	Herpes Simplex	For the last year I've been plagued with severe cold sore/herpes outbreaks around my lips, chin and nose. A never ending cycle of breakout, heal, breakout. After one day of using the cream and Acyclovir the large bump on the side of my lip flattened to the point of not noticing it. Day six and I haven't seen my face look this clear in years. One little teeny whitehead popped up last night below my lip but you can't tell its a herpes sore.  It kind of seemed like a final whimper. If I could rate prior breakouts as a 10 for worst case scenario, this little guy would be a 1. And I'd even thank someone for it. One last thing, If you're insured look around for community health centers, call them and ask for a low cost pharmacy to fill your prescription. I've read online the same Zovirax cream prescription goes for $200, and Acyclovir anywhere from $80-200. I paid $100 for both. Do some research!	10	February 19, 2018	5
Acyclovir Tablets	Cold Sores	Great medicine I've never experienced side effects that I'm aware of and took while pregnant.	10	February 1, 2018	3
Acyclovir Tablets	Herpes Simplex	I had HSV-2 in my 20s.  My doctor gave me a strong prescription of Zyclovair and I think it was for 30 days.  I never had an outbreak again.  The outbreak that I was seen for, was my first and only one and it was really quite bad.  Now I am 49 without a herpes outbreak following the treatment.	10	January 16, 2018	32
Acyclovir Tablets	Herpes Simplex	I’ve been having cold sores since I was 12 on my lips and face. I tried everything and nothing would work. My doctor prescribed me this when he realized how serious it was. I was getting them sometimes one right after the other one!  I’m supposed to take one gram a day, but I found that when I did that I still got them frequently. So I only take it when I feel a tingle , I take about 4 and it never comes out. What sucks is when I don’t get the tingle and I just wake up with a full blow on sore/sores. Overall medicine really helps though! Completely free with my insurance as well!	7	October 22, 2017	2

Acyclovir Tablets	Cold Sores	My experience is that I have had cold sores ONLY on my lips from age 6 to 35. I agreed to a 1st date...bam! I felt it. That is the key; take meds once 1st felt. I have no medical knowledge except I know what my body tolerates and what has been successful which may not be your best bet but be safe careful and consult you Dr b4 any treatment plan.  1. break up your pills in half for immediate absorbtion take 800mg every 2 hours to slam your system to alert it there's an issue and send in a 2nd round of 800 within 1st 4 hours 2. continue 800 for 2 days every 4 hours 3. apply Abreva or similar product on the sore at first sensation, while taking the meds so you are attacking the infection from inside (meds) and externally (creme on sore) 4 days	9	August 23, 2017	8

Acyclovir Tablets	Herpes Simplex	I'm 48 and I was diagnosed with genital herpes when I was 35. I started dating a new guy and within 2 weeks I felt horrible burning when I urinated. I went to my midwives and sure enough I had herpes. Funny thing is I wasn't with anyone prior to him and I was with him for 6 years and not once did he ever test positive. They actually claim I could have had it on my face touched it and touched my genitals without washing my hands and transferred it. The outbreaks are less and less over the years but when I feel one coming I take acyclovir 500mg 2x daily. It helps right away. And I use a squirt bottle with warm water as I urinated to help reduce the burning.	10	July 1, 2017	21
Acyclovir Tablets	Herpes Simplex	Good day to every one reading this, I am here to give my testimony about a  herbal doctor  called dr tokubo who helped me in my life. I was infected with HERPES SIMPLEX virus in 2015, i went to many hospitals for cure and they told me there was no solution for it, so I was thinking how i can  get a solution so that my body can be okay. One day I was in the river side thinking where I can go to get solution, Along the line a lady walked to me telling me why am I so sad and i open up all to her telling her my problem, she told me that she can help me out, she introduce me to a doctor who uses herbal medication to cure HERPES SIMPLEX virus and gave me his email, so i mail him to order for his herbal medicine.

Acyclovir Tablets	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	I have found that acyclovir works better for me when I take pine cone extract. I believe this extract works as an adjuvant, increases the potency of this antiviral drug.  I have been using this combination for several years and have had only two outbreaks in 3 years apposed to 3-4 a year when only using acyclovir 400 mg daily. This makes me believe that the extract is working.  Research suggests that certain compounds found in pine cone extract increases specific Dendritic immune cells.	8	June 1, 2017	14

Acyclovir Tablets	Herpes Simplex	I found out I contracted genital herpes from an ex boyfriend about 5 years ago. It initially felt like a cut on my vagina that itched and burned. Went to Dr next day and sure enough- herpes (ugh). I take the medicine as needed and it works like a charm. If I do feel one coming I take 400mg  three day for about 4-5 days. Clears right up. I also used to get cold sore a few times a year- haven't since taking this medicine. It's AMAZING. Just wish I never had to find out about it.	9	April 5, 2017	25
Acyclovir Tablets	Herpes Simplex	At 29 weeks pregnant I had a fever. Thought I was leaking amniotic fluid. Went to the hospital and misdiagnosed with a UTI. Stayed overnight with IVF and antibiotics and checked, monitored and ultrasound before discharged the following day. 24 hours later still not having felt well went back to the hospital and rechecked, water broke dilated to 2 and Dr said she didn't think of it before, but was going to test and treat me for Genital Herpes. Right after the emergency c section. 	7	April 4, 2017	5
Acyclovir Tablets	Herpes Simplex	About 5 days ago I realized a cut, I thought I had cut myself while shaving... it then got very uncomfortable and burned while I urinated. Finally, I took my camera down there and wanted to look... I noticed a few more cuts  that look like canker sores so I made an appointment right away. She told me it looked like genital herpes. She gave my the cream and the pills. It's only been a day and it doesn't feel like it's working. I know it's soon. But I still feel like I'm on fire, I'm itchy, and it still burns like crazy. Is there anything else I can do?	2	March 29, 2017	17
Acyclovir Tablets	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	I have found this drug to be very effective in controlling my IBS/ inflammatory bowel disease.  Clearly it's possible herpes has a role to play in these conditions.	9	March 7, 2017	12
Acyclovir Tablets	Herpes Simplex	This is the only thing that works for myself stress induced break outs (college). I use both the pills and the cream. I believe when I first started using acyclovir it was more effective  and now it can take a good 4-5 days to fully heal. This is nothing in comparison to a cold sore that lasted a month without the meds though! 400mg. Free with my healthcare for the pills, the cream was $25.	9	February 22, 2017	8
Acyclovir and Hydrocortisone	Xerese (acyclovir / hydrocortisone)	Summary - If you get a cold sore, use Valacyclovir and Xerese ASAP and don't stop until it is gone!!!    Details - My nose (area between the two nostrils) started getting red Tuesday morning.   I just put Neosporin on it Tuesday night.  I woke up Wed realizing it was a cold sore issue.  I was out of town and didn't have the cold sore meds with me.  I got Valacyclovir filled and immediately starting taking 2 pills in the AM and PM.  I then got Acyclovir cream filled (as Xerese was not available).  I used that cream almost every two hours.  I kept taking both drugs all day Wed and Thursday, even though for Valacyclovir you can stop after 1 day.  I didn't want to chance it.  I got home late Thursday from traveling and swapped out Acyclovir for Xerese because Xersese is 100x better.  Results - AMAZING!  All I had was a very tiny scar on Friday afternoon.

Acyclovir (injection)	Cold Sores	I have taken acyclovir sporadically for the last two years. My blood cell count was low so I was forced to go off it for a number of months after beginning treatment. I resumed taking it two months ago and I must admit it has been very good. Before beginning acyclovir I had only 1-2 obs but almost constant nerve pain in the anal region. It had been like this (undiagnosed despite numerous doctor's visits) for around 17 years. After acyclovir began and then stopped because of blood cell count, it was however infinitely worse. I had permanent obs and permanent nerve pain in the anal region, and now I had permanent nerve pain in my vaginal area. my doctor originally prescribed me 400mg twice a day but I found I need to take it 3 times a day in order to quell the obs. I am hoping that in another 10-24 months it will be cured but I am suspending my belief as yet.	7	March 13, 2021	0
Acyclovir (injection)	Herpes Simplex	Every few years it occurs, always keep it in reserve because if you are fast enough, a single 800mg can stop it in its tracks, maybe 2 or 3 just to be sure..	10	March 12, 2021	4
Acyclovir (injection)	Herpes Simplex	I found out on Tuesday  that I have herpes went to many doctors before got diagnosed with herpes started itching in 2014 didn't know what it was but can someone give me some advice on how to rid myself of it	3	February 19, 2021	0
Acyclovir (injection)	Herpes Zoster	I took Acyclovir because of shingles, I had to take 800mg 5x a day for 7 days. On the first day I was okay, second day I felt dizzy and a little  nauseous, third day I had severe nausea! Which was horrible! Other symptoms included ....feeling spaced out , stomach cramping , headache , sweating when I was asleep. It’s better to finish the course which I managed to do ! Thank god! However it did clear my rash away	9	December 17, 2020	0
Acyclovir (injection)	Herpes Simplex	My child caught rash on skin. I don’t know where she came in contact with it. We had been on vacations and she was in swimming. It comes back often times every two months. It stays longer when acyclovir is used. I used the cream and the oral liquid and it the outbreak lasted for a long time and it comes back as soon as treatment stops. I’m currently trying essential oils and it clears up faster but I don’t know about the recurrences yet.	1	December 5, 2020	0
Acyclovir (injection)	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	I don't know how I got infected with genital herpes - I was with someone who didn't have it so can only assume it had laid dormant for a number of years when someone else had given it to me. The first outbreak was 10 years ago, but was just an itchy spot in my pubic area close to my panty line. The second outbreak came a month or so later and was just a couple of blisters. When I was diagnosed, my whole world collapsed. I was in therapy for 2 years, it really hit me hard. I've taken acyclovir twice a day since then. I haven't had an outbreak but some days I still get the tingling and ache around my pubic area. On those days, I get very low and upset. I may try a different drug.	8	November 14, 2020	6
Acyclovir (injection)	Herpes Simplex	I think it worked okay within 3 days my breakout was gone. But I don't like that you have to take it 3 times daily for a week straight then keep taking it for prevention if you get breakouts because I forget half the time. It makes me really sick if I don't eat and I have celiac disease so if you can't eat much like I can't this isn't the right kind for you. Because it's not the right one for me and the pill itself is huge looks like a dungeon and dragon symbol	9	October 31, 2020	1
Acyclovir (injection)	Herpes Simplex	I'm 74 years old. First diagnosed 40 years ago so I've been using  Zovirax and acyclovir cream a while. Both have been effective in eliminating or reducing outbreaks. Especially if applied at very first signs of oncoming event. I haven't had a cold sore in that time because I apply the cream when I feel any tingling or raised skin surface. Very little cream is needed to be effective but, several applications a day works best.	10	September 24, 2020	7
Acyclovir (injection)	Sitavig (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	I’ve been getting cold sores once-twice a year for the last 5 years. I do not get a small blister that turns my lip slightly red. When one emerges, it is so large and painful that one entire side of lip is completely swollen. It can be so unsightly and painful for those two weeks that I typically don’t leave the house. I’ve always taken Valtrex as quickly as possible upon feeling symptoms and haven’t found it to be effective. The Sitavig, however, has been a godsend. I applied it upon first notice of a small blister forming. The blister still appeared but is small enough that you can’t really see it unless you know what you’re looking for. There is no swelling and very, very little discomfort (slight itching). I’m only on day 2 of the sore and already it’s shrunk. Highly recommend for anyone who gets large, painful cold sores.	8	September 15, 2020	2
Acyclovir (injection)	Herpes Simplex	I was diagnosed with herpes this year after getting it from my partner. I had a fairly bad first outbreak on my inner labia and just presumed it to be from shaving but I went to a sexual health clinic and got diagnosed. This medicine has been so helpful anytime I have a tingling/throbbing sensation I take it and it works wonders. I’m currently taking it at the moment and the only real side effect I have is having a headache!		July 29, 2020	7
Acyclovir (injection)	Herpes Simplex	I am 43 I just recently got diagnosed with HSV2 with two previous false negative tests. It sucks not 2 know when and where you got the infection from I've never seen any breakouts on any 1 I've been with but I'm seeing you can contract this even with a condom. I have breakouts in more than 1 place inner labial outer labial which I thought was a ingrown hair infection.  Also have a breakout in the anal area but mostly the upper part of the crack which is weird. I hate this. I've been with my bf for 7 yrs he said he had a cold sore before but I don't think he gave it to me by me having 2 false tests. I'm so ashamed as I'd rather have had gonorrhea or chlamydia if I had to suffer from a STD as you can get rid of those. I haven't been able to share this news with my boyfriend as I'm afraid how he may react, he has really tripping about this COVID virus . But I may have had this 4 awhile and luckily I've never transmitted it and this is my first time with an actual blisters.	7	May 22, 2020	18
Acyclovir (injection)	Herpes Simplex	My child came in contact on va cction and has a skin rash HSV-1 and this medicine does not work at all for her. I hate to see her so irritated I wish there was an actual cure. I used vinegar and coconut oils and it took just as long to clear as this drug..	1	May 20, 2020	2
Acyclovir (injection)	Herpes Simplex	Started taking this after an outbreak. Thought the first one was just irritation from a wax. Realized after that second time it happened that it was definitely herpes and triggered by bikini waxing. Now take this daily to suppress and have not had an outbreak since (over a year). Have found it definitely has caused me to have increased sweating at night, which is annoying, but otherwise no issues.	10	May 11, 2020	7
Acyclovir (injection)	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	I had itching for 3 months before my first HSV-2 lesion appeared. It was very mild but I had the fever, swollen lymph nodes and intense burning. I took Acyclovir for 5 days which reduced my symptoms quickly. I am now on 400mg twice daily for suppression, however I still get the odd itch here and there.	9	April 22, 2020	9
Acyclovir (injection)	Herpes Simplex	I was getting many cold sores every year. I would take Acyclovir as soon as the numbness started. It never shortened the duration; never had any effect on the pain. The cold sores just kept getting worse. The doctor finally put me on a stronger anti-viral. It did nothing either. I only got headaches from the anti-virals. I finally decided to try vitamin D. I haven't had a cold sore in at least 2 years.	1	April 19, 2020	15
Acyclovir (injection)	Herpes Simplex	I was prescribed this meds and it did work, years later I'm still battling with this virus, I never gave it on to anyone, anytime I feel discomfort I call my dr to send a script to the pharmacy. I have had a outbreak on different parts of my vagina and by my anus & mouth. The ones that comes by my vulvar or anus is the worst especially when I urinate I always have that cup of water to pour while I urinate so it wouldn't burn.I'm having an outbreak now I been feeling this itch & painful feeling that got me up. I took a pill about 30 min ago I can honestly tell you Im feeling the med kick in. My pill is 500mg I try to keep some on hands for times like this my dr is close.	10	April 12, 2020	3
Acyclovir (injection)	Herpes Zoster	I have herpes zoster (shingles)in  internal, inner ear. Damage to both trigeminal and occipital nerve. Facial paralysis. This medicine possibly saved my life, and the capsule form worked much better than the tablet form for me. It does give me some side effects such as an upset stomach and a weird energizing feeling (less with capsule for me), but if you truly need the medicine, please take it. This virus, if left untreated, can destroy your health and well-being and possibly kill you. Do not underestimate what it can do to your body.	10	April 2, 2020	9

Acyclovir (injection)	Herpes Simplex	I had back to back outbreaks after 8 years of no outbreaks at all. I take two 400mg tablets of aciclovir a day and I have not had an outbreak since. It has honestly saved my life. I forget I even carry the virus (I told my partner when we got together) and we have unprotected sex and have not passed it on (I have never transmitted to a partner)  TRY THE MEDS THEY WORK.. thank god	10	February 10, 2020	33
Acyclovir (injection)	Herpes Zoster	Discovered I had shingles after reading the Google medical journal lol. Started with mysterious left leg flu like feeling, and excruciating burning pain almost to tears on my left butt cheek. Then bumps on my butt. Decided to take monolaurin (dietary supplement) 3-3x/day for 2 days instead of going to dr. I had no pain and rash was going away. I caved and went to dr to get an Rx of an antiviral so I wouldn’t get post neuralgia. After taking for 2 days I now realize it’s messing with my head. It’s making me feel hopeless and no interest. I am going to discontinue and hope for the best. I will continue with Monolaurin as I think it helped stave off additional outbreaks.	1	February 9, 2020	6
Acyclovir (injection)	Herpes Simplex	I had a rash on my hand that my doctor thought (misdiagnosed) was the shingles. I was prescribed acyclovir and I had a severe allergic reaction. It turns out it was Dyshidrosis (pompholyx) blisters on your hands from stress. Chickenpox/shingles are viral, you do not need to take anything except pain medication. I suffered with hives all over my body the size of dinner plates, it felt like I was being burned alive. I was throwing up, lost weight and my skin/face began to show signs of jaundice. I thought I maybe fatal at one point, my skin began to thin to the point I was seeing the coloration of muscle underneath. I still have scars from it. I had these terrible hives for three months until I was given a steroid shot and montelukast. It was a terrible allergic reaction and this medication is known to cause Steven Johnsons Syndrome (SJS), google it because it is terrifying. The hives were gone in 24 hours after getting steroid shot. Do not take this medication, you could get SJS which can be  the end of your life  or ruin your life.		December 29, 2019	7

Acyclovir (injection)	Herpes Zoster	The acyclovir from Camber Drug Co. and shaped like a stop sign don't work very well. The last ones I had from another company worked just fine.

Acyclovir (injection)	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	First out break of HSV2 at 18,  then  I had NO symptoms at all for 8 YEARS!  Then got back to back out breakouts at 26 years old for 3 months.  Started taking aciclovir 400mg twice a day as suppressive therapy and have had NO symptoms since, for three months.  Side effects minimal.  My advice is just try it because it has saved me :) x	10	December 10, 2019	16

Acyclovir (injection)	Herpes Simplex	Prescribed for cold sore outbreaks, three 400mg  tabs per day, took for 2 days; my heart is racing, cannot concentrate, blood pressure 157/91, my blood pressure was 120/74 two days prior to using this medication, a general feeling of unwellness, 		August 28, 2019	16
Acyclovir (injection)	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	I ended up misdiagnosed on several occasions with what felt like a uti and or thrush. After five days of agony and burning fever I knew something was wrong. I had one sore which experts misdiagnosed as a cyst. Finally a GP confirmed my worst fears. An STD in my thirties. I can still count my encounters on one hand but anyone that has sex risk takes the virus and I was just unlucky. I was lucky my partner who was a week into our relationship was so supportive. I take acyclovir as a preventative medication to avoid more breakouts and it works a treat. I get the odd itch but no symtoms. I sometimes feel tired with it and alcohol I have to be careful with. Otherwise I really recommend it for self esteem getting back on your feet and with the whole acceptance aspect. One in six of us have it. This makes it manageable. A vaccine or cure would be better still... But out of all the illnesses and diseases this isn't the worst one.. Count the blessings x	10	August 27, 2019	49
Acyclovir (injection)	Herpes Simplex	I've been using Acyclovir for some time now. Sadly I am noticing that it takes longer to work when I am having an outbreak and I am also noticing outbreaks in different places I never had them before. My hair is beginning to fall out which I was never told was a side affect. I am stressing even more having to deal with those  which is cause more frequent outbreaks.	6	August 19, 2019	13
Acyclovir (injection)	Herpes Simplex	So I am 65 and haven’t had an outbreak for 4 years.    In the past couple of days I’ve had a burning sensation that comes and goes.   It’s in a different place than I’ve ever had it.   There is absolutely nothing to see, no blisters or sore.   But it is so tender I’m lying around with ice on my crotch.  My jeans shorts were painful to the area.    I have the Acyclovir on hand but how do I know if it’s a herpes outbreak.?   It almost feels like it’s bruised.  Again nothing visible.   Is this a giant outbreak waiting to surface?? Is it harmful to take a corse of it “just to be safe?		August 8, 2019	13
Acyclovir (injection)	Herpes Simplex	Stress is NO good for people with HSV2 it activates the virus. I’ve had a rash for about 3 months. Until I got fed up and missed seeing my privates clean and smooth so took a trip to my gyno and she prescribed me acyclovir twice a day and it’s almost clearing up!! On my 5th day of taking the pill.	9	July 28, 2019	15
Acyclovir (injection)	Herpes Simplex	Have had HSV-2 for 15 years. Take the pills on a schedule and try to avoid being stressed because this disease will never go away. Eventually you just get use to having it. Stay positive.		July 5, 2019	28
Acyclovir (injection)	Herpes Simplex	I am a 30 yr old woman and I recently became diagnosed with genital herpes a few days. I started seeing a guy that didn't know he's infected with it. We had sex one of the times without a condom and BOOM here I am. I started having a burning while peeing a few days later, vaginal irritation, stomach cramping ect. I was given a RX for an UTI. 3 days later, I broke out in a few painful little bumps, and the burning in my urination got worse. Then I got a fever. I went to the ER and the doctor diagnosed me genital herpes. Luckily it's a small localized area she said, and gave me Acyclovir  400 MG to take 3x a day. I'm on the 3rd day and it's a huge difference. The site is healing, it's not burning when I urinate, no more fever, and a lot less discharge. I've gotten some side effects of being very drowsy and tired, and tingling random places. The only thing I hate is the drowsiness. I've been fighting to stay awake at work the past 2 days of it really kicking in.	10	June 27, 2019	23
Acyclovir (injection)	Herpes Simplex	I became very irritated down there to the point  it hurt to go to the bathroom I schedule an appointment for the doctor and they told me I had a yeast infection I then noticed bumps down there and they tested for HSV2 (herpes simplex 2) came back positive. Currently day 3 of acyclovir and I am so happy to almost be back to myself. The pain I went through was unbearable... had to call out of work several times because I could barely walk. We will see how this medicine works for me overtime	8	June 10, 2019	18
Acyclovir (injection)	Zovirax (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	I get coldsores mainly in the summer, my symptoms start of with dry and itchy lips, and then they start to blister and swell, I recommend if you have the same symptoms as me then put the Zovirax on as SOON AS POSSIBLE! The cold sore feels much better as soon as it’s on, the healing begins straight away, the blister on the mouth begins to dry out so it may feel uncomfortable, because of this I also use Carmex Lip Balm to keep my lips moisturised. I use Zovirax every time I get a cold sore and they heal much faster, for me it’s max 4 days. Amazing product and definietely worth the money!	10	April 14, 2019	8
Acyclovir (injection)	Herpes Simplex	"Have had HSV2 for 30 years and take Acyclovir 400 mg for episodic outbreaks. In the ""early years"",I used Zovirax ointment, which is very good, but the tablets are betteras you take the medication early, before the dreadful outbreak, in the form of Acyclovir 400mg/2-3x daily for 3-5 days has been an unbelievable blessing. It IS a horrible disease, but Acyclovir makes it bearable."	10	April 8, 2019	13
Acyclovir (injection)	Cold Sores	Summary - If you get a cold sore, use Valacyclovir and Xerese ASAP and don't stop until it is gone!!!    Details - My nose (area between the two nostrils) started getting red Tuesday morning.   I just put Neosporin on it Tuesday night.  I woke up Wed realizing it was a cold sore issue.  I was out of town and didn't have the cold sore meds with me.  I got Valacyclovir filled and immediately starting taking 2 pills in the AM and PM.  I then got Acyclovir cream filled (as Xerese was not available).  I used that cream almost every two hours.  It is very good, but not as optimal as Xerese.  I kept taking both drugs all day Wed and Thursday, even though for Valacyclovir you can stop after 1 day.  I didn't want to chance it.  I got home late Thursday from traveling and swapped out Acyclovir for Xerese.  Results - AMAZING!  All I had was a very tiny scar on Friday afternoon.		March 16, 2019	3
Acyclovir (injection)	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	I was diagnosed with HSV-2 six  months ago. The guy I was seeing had told me before we slept together, and we always used condoms, but it was still transmitted. First outbreak was grim and lasted for about a month, huge blisters on my thighs rendered me unable to walk. I stopped dating for a long time because I couldn't seem to control the outbreaks, and it seemed I was getting them back-to-back every week (although they never came out as full sores, just slight itching and discomfort). I started taking suppressive acyclovir (2 x 400mg per day) after 4 months, and so far the 'outbreaks' have just been itchy with no visible sores. Though I do still get them frequently despite leading a healthy, for the most part stress-free lifestyle. I will continue to take suppressive acyclovir for the foreseeable future to see if my body can eventually adjust to the virus.	7	February 9, 2019	13
Acyclovir (injection)	Herpes Simplex	When using oral and cream at onset gets rid of them fast. But remember this oral stuff  really bad on the liver. If outbreaks are like a few times a year not to worry. If down in Mexico can get for a fraction of the cost then in the states.	10	January 25, 2019	6
Acyclovir (injection)	Sitavig (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	This stuff is amazing! At first it was difficult to apply to gums (it is a tablet you stick on your gums and you don't swallow it). It say sto use round side to apply to gums but I found it easier to use flat side of tablet. If you catch it in time you just get a tiny bump and it goes down by the next day. I haven't had a bad blister in over a year. Use to get them 3 to 4 times a year. Now, maybe 2. If u don't have insurance this medication will be expensive unfortunately.	9	January 19, 2019	2
Acyclovir (injection)	Herpes Simplex	My fiance and I discovered, in the beginning of our relationship, that we both had genital herpes. My first outbreak was the ABSOLUTE worst experience, I was so sick. We suffered for 2 years, had constant breakouts and then finally we decided to both respectively take acyclovir. Doses are 800 mg tablet every day, and honest to goodness it was a miracle drug. We have been on it for 3 months now and except for an occasional itch here and there that lasts for a day and then goes away, neither of us have had the lesions or the terrible symptoms. We do not take it when we feel symptoms; instead, we take 800mg every day, possibly for the rest of our lives but that's okay so long as we never have to experience another outbreak!!	10	December 5, 2018	20
Acyclovir (injection)	Cold Sores	Its no exaggeration that cold sores on my lips has in a way, been ruining my life. It has ended relationships, and I've learned to become ashamed. I had a boyfriend in high school who kissed me with one and now I get them several times a year, and in the winter its back to back. Its horrible.  But this drug is a life saver. I wake up with mine, no tingles. I blast them instantly with 2 at a time ever few hours, and by the end of the night the blisters will cease. What took a week to two weeks to heal now only takes days, sometimes its not even noticeable at all. I now take this everyday to prevent outbreaks. This is a huge relief in my life. I recommend for anyone who suffers like me!	10	November 29, 2018	18
Acyclovir (injection)	Herpes Simplex	taking 400mg once a day works for me to prevent outbreaks		October 30, 2018	7
Acyclovir (injection)	Cold Sores	I'm a 35 year old female who has suffered from cold sores for so long I have pictures of me as a 3 year old with them, almost every year book picture, me with a cold sore. Every period, stressed, every Holiday. I was prescribed Acyclovir at 33 years old after giving birth to my first child. I had an outbreak and worried about my son catching the virus from me (Herpes is dangerous/deadly for infants) as my mother was so irresponsible when I caught it young. It's amazing, I remember thinking as a small child If given 3 wishes, one would be never get Cold sores again. I'd been on it and hadn't experienced one in almost 2 years. I'm very grateful l I'd never experienced ocular or genital herpes and have great sympathy for those who do. Acyclovir is a miracle for me	10	September 30, 2018	11
Acyclovir (injection)	Cold Sores	I use this drug for the occasional cold sore that I get on and/or around my mouth. I live in Mexico and found this drug over the counter. Super sad to hear the cream costs $200 !! Here a 5g tube and 50 tabs of 400 mg tablets cost me a whopping $7 USD. I have a few different tubes so I can have it available if I ever feel a tingle.  And since it’s so cheap if I see even a stranger with a cold sore I offer it to them. It is a miracle worker for me. If I am fortunate enough to catch it in time to take a pill it rarely goes to a full blister. And if it does it is contained to a very slight bump. For me it also relieves any discomfort.	10	September 19, 2018	6
Acyclovir (injection)	Herpes Simplex	After trying A LOT of different things Acyclovir is definitely what you need to be taking ASAP. As soon as you feel any tingling at all. If you are unfortunate enough to have reached the weeping sores phase I found the only thing to soothe the pain was salt water with black tea. Pop a tea bag in with hot very salty water and cleanse your intimate area once cool enough. Sounds mad but you'll thank me after!	8	September 5, 2018	15
Acyclovir (injection)	Herpes Zoster	I had  herpes zoster in April 2017, was  prescribed   acyclovir 400mg x2  with anti-allergic tabs  for seven days and  was cured  although  after-effects were felt for long.   Interestingly,  I also got rid of another medical condition that had been  bothering me for more than a year prior to the  herpes   attack.  After one year,  symptoms of  old  problem (not herpes) developed again.  I told  doctor about the effect  acyclovir tabs had on it a year ago.  But the doctor laughed away  my observations  and  prescribed  other medicines.  When  I didn't get  relief even after my third visit to her, she reluctantly prescribed acyclovir tabs.  I was completely cured after eight days. Before going public with full details,   I would like to share it with  manufacturers of acyclovir tabs.  They may like to initiate some more research on this wonderful drug and arrive at a definitive conclusion vis-a-vis my observations.    I may  offer myself for  clinical trials, if necessary.	10	August 19, 2018	8
Acyclovir (injection)	Zovirax (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	Took one ten day course of this anti-viral over seven years ago and have never had even a hint of another fever blister symptom ever since.   I felt better after first week, and remarkably stronger after completing  the 10 day prescription . Next best thing to a cure.	9	July 9, 2018	15
Acyclovir (injection)	Cold Sores	This medication is great! I can't believe it works so fast.. I  will definitely recommend it!	10	May 20, 2018	6
Acyclovir (injection)	Herpes Simplex	Great drug .. it’s a shame the cream is so expensive. Tablet for relatively inexpensive. Why is the ointment so expensive?		May 6, 2018	5
Acyclovir (injection)	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	My first outbreak was horrific. I could not walk for a week the pain was so unbearable. I laid in bed the whole time with cold packs between my legs and dreaded when having to use the bathroom because the pain was excruciating. I started this medication 4 days after I was infected and had symptoms. It did help and I have been on it for a couple of months now and no side effects. My doctor wants me to be on it for 2 years for suppressive therapy and then try to get off of it. She did inform me however that if I had several outbreaks, she had no problem putting me back on it. She assured me it was safe longterm. There have been times I have forgotten to take my meds and within a few days I have some symptoms, but then I start back up again and in a few days, I am feeling better. This medicine truly allows me to forget that I have HSV-2, other than when I take my meds. It’s been a miracle for me.	10	March 25, 2018	14
Acyclovir (injection)	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	I've had fever blisters since I was a child. When I was a teenager I got fever blisters a lot.  As I got older usually just in the summer. About 4 years  ago I was getting them every other month. Dr put me on 400mg twice daily. Have not had any in the last year and a half.  What a difference its made in my life!	10	March 25, 2018	5

Acyclovir (injection)	Cold Sores	16 years ago I was accidentally poked in my eye. The following day my eye flared up  very inflamed and painful. I was diagnosed  with viral keratitis (cold sore virus in the eye).  About 5 years later they finally put me on zovirax  tablets 800mg. I found them great. Didn't take long for to clear it up  while also using zovirax  eye ointment  I have had less breakouts over the years compared to the 3 or 4 a year I had been experiencing before be I got prescribed this. These tablets were the answer to my prayers as it's extremely painful when I have an outbreak in my eyes. I currently have an outbreak and my doctor has me on 400mg five times a day as well as  the eye ointment. I've found with this medication the breakouts are less  frequent and the symptoms less severe. Also this  is free for me as it's cover by medical card which is great. No side effects. For me I would highly recommend  zovirax aka adviclor  to anyone  wanting to treat an outbreak	10	February 23, 2018	3
Acyclovir (injection)	Herpes Simplex	For the last year I've been plagued with severe cold sore/herpes outbreaks around my lips, chin and nose. A never ending cycle of breakout, heal, breakout. After one day of using the cream and Acyclovir the large bump on the side of my lip flattened to the point of not noticing it. Day six and I haven't seen my face look this clear in years. One little teeny whitehead popped up last night below my lip but you can't tell its a herpes sore.  It kind of seemed like a final whimper. If I could rate prior breakouts as a 10 for worst case scenario, this little guy would be a 1. And I'd even thank someone for it. One last thing, If you're insured look around for community health centers, call them and ask for a low cost pharmacy to fill your prescription. I've read online the same Zovirax cream prescription goes for $200, and Acyclovir anywhere from $80-200. I paid $100 for both. Do some research!	10	February 19, 2018	5
Acyclovir (injection)	Cold Sores	Great medicine I've never experienced side effects that I'm aware of and took while pregnant.	10	February 1, 2018	3
Acyclovir (injection)	Herpes Simplex	I had HSV-2 in my 20s.  My doctor gave me a strong prescription of Zyclovair and I think it was for 30 days.  I never had an outbreak again.  The outbreak that I was seen for, was my first and only one and it was really quite bad.  Now I am 49 without a herpes outbreak following the treatment.	10	January 16, 2018	32
Acyclovir (injection)	Herpes Simplex	I’ve been having cold sores since I was 12 on my lips and face. I tried everything and nothing would work. My doctor prescribed me this when he realized how serious it was. I was getting them sometimes one right after the other one!  I’m supposed to take one gram a day, but I found that when I did that I still got them frequently. So I only take it when I feel a tingle , I take about 4 and it never comes out. What sucks is when I don’t get the tingle and I just wake up with a full blow on sore/sores. Overall medicine really helps though! Completely free with my insurance as well!	7	October 22, 2017	2
Acyclovir (injection)	Herpes Simplex	Been taking this medicine for two years with no outbreaks and no side effects. It's been life changing.	10	September 14, 2017	15
Acyclovir (injection)	Cold Sores	My experience is that I have had cold sores ONLY on my lips from age 6 to 35. I agreed to a 1st date...bam! I felt it. That is the key; take meds once 1st felt. I have no medical knowledge except I know what my body tolerates and what has been successful which may not be your best bet but be safe careful and consult you Dr b4 any treatment plan.  1. break up your pills in half for immediate absorbtion take 800mg every 2 hours to slam your system to alert it there's an issue and send in a 2nd round of 800 within 1st 4 hours 2. continue 800 for 2 days every 4 hours 3. apply Abreva or similar product on the sore at first sensation, while taking the meds so you are attacking the infection from inside (meds) and externally (creme on sore) 4 days	9	August 23, 2017	8

Acyclovir (injection)	Herpes Simplex	I'm 48 and I was diagnosed with genital herpes when I was 35. I started dating a new guy and within 2 weeks I felt horrible burning when I urinated. I went to my midwives and sure enough I had herpes. Funny thing is I wasn't with anyone prior to him and I was with him for 6 years and not once did he ever test positive. They actually claim I could have had it on my face touched it and touched my genitals without washing my hands and transferred it. The outbreaks are less and less over the years but when I feel one coming I take acyclovir 500mg 2x daily. It helps right away. And I use a squirt bottle with warm water as I urinated to help reduce the burning.	10	July 1, 2017	21
Acyclovir (injection)	Herpes Simplex	Good day to every one reading this, I am here to give my testimony about a  herbal doctor  called dr tokubo who helped me in my life. I was infected with HERPES SIMPLEX virus in 2015, i went to many hospitals for cure and they told me there was no solution for it, so I was thinking how i can  get a solution so that my body can be okay. One day I was in the river side thinking where I can go to get solution, Along the line a lady walked to me telling me why am I so sad and i open up all to her telling her my problem, she told me that she can help me out, she introduce me to a doctor who uses herbal medication to cure HERPES SIMPLEX virus and gave me his email, so i mail him to order for his herbal medicine.

Acyclovir (injection)	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	I have found that acyclovir works better for me when I take pine cone extract. I believe this extract works as an adjuvant, increases the potency of this antiviral drug.  I have been using this combination for several years and have had only two outbreaks in 3 years apposed to 3-4 a year when only using acyclovir 400 mg daily. This makes me believe that the extract is working.  Research suggests that certain compounds found in pine cone extract increases specific Dendritic immune cells.	8	June 1, 2017	14
Acyclovir (injection)	Cold Sores	It gave me prostate issues and erection problems. I never had a breakout. The trade off wasn't worth it.		May 17, 2017	1
Acyclovir (injection)	Herpes Simplex	I found out I contracted genital herpes from an ex boyfriend about 5 years ago. It initially felt like a cut on my vagina that itched and burned. Went to Dr next day and sure enough- herpes (ugh). I take the medicine as needed and it works like a charm. If I do feel one coming I take 400mg  three day for about 4-5 days. Clears right up. I also used to get cold sore a few times a year- haven't since taking this medicine. It's AMAZING. Just wish I never had to find out about it.	9	April 5, 2017	25
Acyclovir (injection)	Herpes Simplex	At 29 weeks pregnant I had a fever. Thought I was leaking amniotic fluid. Went to the hospital and misdiagnosed with a UTI. Stayed overnight with IVF and antibiotics and checked, monitored and ultrasound before discharged the following day. 24 hours later still not having felt well went back to the hospital and rechecked, water broke dilated to 2 and Dr said she didn't think of it before, but was going to test and treat me for Genital Herpes. Right after the emergency c section. 	7	April 4, 2017	5
Acyclovir (injection)	Herpes Simplex	About 5 days ago I realized a cut, I thought I had cut myself while shaving... it then got very uncomfortable and burned while I urinated. Finally, I took my camera down there and wanted to look... I noticed a few more cuts  that look like canker sores so I made an appointment right away. She told me it looked like genital herpes. She gave my the cream and the pills. It's only been a day and it doesn't feel like it's working. I know it's soon. But I still feel like I'm on fire, I'm itchy, and it still burns like crazy. Is there anything else I can do?	2	March 29, 2017	17
Acyclovir (injection)	Herpes Simplex, Suppression	I have found this drug to be very effective in controlling my IBS/ inflammatory bowel disease.  Clearly it's possible herpes has a role to play in these conditions.	9	March 7, 2017	12
Acyclovir (injection)	Herpes Simplex	This is the only thing that works for myself stress induced break outs (college). I use both the pills and the cream. I believe when I first started using acyclovir it was more effective  and now it can take a good 4-5 days to fully heal. This is nothing in comparison to a cold sore that lasted a month without the meds though! 400mg. Free with my healthcare for the pills, the cream was $25.	9	February 22, 2017	8
Acyclovir topical	Zovirax Cream (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	Zovirax burnt my skin around the cold sore leaving a red mark 2-3 times larger than my cold sore! It also caused this skin to peel. My cold sore is essentially gone after approximately 6 days but now I am left with a very obvious and huge red mark. If you use this cream and it stings or burns at all when you apply it I would suggest stopping usage straight away. It says that this may be a “mild” symptom of using the cream. I wish I had stopped using it as soon as I felt the stinging sensation.	2	April 20, 2021	0
Acyclovir topical	Zovirax Cream (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	I'm from the UK, and have had cold sores all my life (40s)  Zovirax is a complete waste of money.  For years I used it because I believed the marketing - and i thought that cold sores just got bigger, but about 5 years ago I tried just leaving well alone.  Without Zovirax, they crust faster, don't spread and heal faster and more naturally.  With Zovirax, I find it burns the skin, they spread (keep popping up outside the original zone) and scar for longer.   I've also not really found that Zovirax prevents them if you get there during the original tingling either.  Also - the tube size is a scandal.	1	February 16, 2021	4
Acyclovir topical	Herpes Simplex	I 100% recommend this acyclovir prescription/treatment to anyone suffering from herpes! I was diagnosed we with herpes simplex 1, and have used abreva, valtrex, and have tried random sworn by home remedies. Abreva after by maybe day 7 started to work, valtrex after close to a week began to work, the home remedies did not work at all!!! All in all, the effectiveness of what I've tried prior to acyclovir did not impress me as much as this prescription has. I was a day into my outbreak, my lip was already swollen and bubbled. That one day in I started the cream and the next day , it had gone down 80%. It was already scabbed over and no longer pulsating! This has definitely been a blessing to me, as I am very skeptical at times when it comes to medications that says to be close to 100% effective!	10	February 2, 2021	3
Acyclovir topical	Zovirax Cream (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	Not so much the effect but the affect of opening this packaging? I could not believe my eyes the size of 2g tube? Absolutely shocking to say the least & for £5. Once I pierced it open I could then turn the tube at least 3 times before the cream appeared. I'm sure this is a great product? But will there be enough to get rid of my problem?	5	January 22, 2021	1
Acyclovir topical	Zovirax Cream (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	Would highly recommend giving this a go. Was diagnosed with HSV1 cold sores last year and this has by far been my best experience. Had a cold sore first appear yesterday and has pretty much already cleared up after using this Zovirax Duo a few times over the course of 24 hours. Love this stuff!	10	October 14, 2020	2
Acyclovir topical	Cold Sores	Everyone is saying how expensive it is $250 etc, why don't you buy a uk version and have it delivered to USA, here in uk online you can buy Zovirax (active ingredient 5% acyclovir) for like £5.00 which will be like $7.50	10	August 19, 2020	1
Acyclovir topical	Herpes Simplex	"I have had cold sore outbreaks around my mouth since my childhood. I have tried absolutely everything (i.e. : Lipactin, Abreva and so on) and the only topical treatment I've found to be effective is acyclovir cream 5% (I buy generics). If applied early in the onset, sores typically remain small and will dry within a day or two. Before switching to acyclovir cream, an outbreak would last from 4 to 7 days. Now, 2 to 4 days is the usual. It feels like you are skipping the nasty and uncomfortable phase right after the outbreak to go straight to the ""recovery"" phase where the skin is healing under the dried scabs. I always carry some with me now."	9	August 12, 2020	6
Acyclovir topical	Zovirax Cream (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	Okay so I always had cold sores all my life, one advise, don't use zovirex. It spreads and it leaves a nasty scar which takes ages to heal. Use ordinary Vaseline to keep it moist but only apply small amount, too much moisture can also create the cold sore to worsen. Aqueous worked for me.		June 24, 2020	1
Acyclovir topical	Zovirax Cream (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	I love zovirax, I prefer the pump tube to the metal tube as I feel it's more hygienic. However I have recently been trying Zovirax Duo which is a few dollars more than the regular cream, but it's amazing. The day after noticing a cold sore, the swelling is already very reduced and scabbing forms. I find the coldsore heals so much faster with the Duo cream	10	May 6, 2020	1
Acyclovir topical	Herpes Simplex	I was prescribed Acyclovir cream for face shingle treatment however I have no cold sores. I am in the scabbing phase.  My dermatologist was negligent to tell me that the tiny tube would cost $230.  This medication seems more designed for intense cold sores.  Not sure its worth a damn if I don't have cold sores and not sure I am willing to spend $230 to see if it helps my scabs lighten.  I don't hold dermatologists in high regard and now a bit less.	1	May 5, 2020	1
Acyclovir topical	Zovirax Cream (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	The worst stuff I have ever used. It burnt and scarred my skin. The cold sore was almost invisible, and Zovirax burnt it and thee surrounding skin. It made it look awful, and made it painful, and took three weeks to heal. NEVER AGAIN,  Beware!	1	March 30, 2020	7
Acyclovir topical	Zovirax Cream (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	It works for me. No doubt about it. But in Canada I had to pay $80 for a tiny tube. Then, 2/3 of the tube was air. So thanks for that.	10	December 24, 2019	6
Acyclovir topical	Zovirax Ointment (acyclovir) for Herpes Simplex	There is some confusion about the cream vs. the ointment.  Chemically, acyclovir is acyclovir.  The only difference between the two is only the 'CARRIER' - cream vs ointment.  The ointment (for genital herpes in U.S.) has polyethylene glycol, a very slippery compound used as in laxatives and for bowel prep.  It has many other medical and industrial uses. Considering the small amount possibly ingested when applying to the mouth, the only reason not to use the cheaper ointment is if you are sensitive to polyethylene glycol.   The cream (oral herpes/cold sores) contains  mineral oil, (also a laxative) poloxamer 407, propylene glycol, sodium lauryl sulfate, water, and white petrolatum.  Proplylene glycol is supposedly good for skin, stops flaking, etc.   Despite hours of research I can't find why cream is so expensive unless maker thinks we'll pay more for a treatment for our face vs genitals. The CREAM is the one that is SO OUTRAGEOUSLY EXPENSIVE!!	10	December 19, 2019	9
Acyclovir topical	Zovirax Cream (acyclovir) for Herpes Simplex	I have had a spot come up twice in 14 years on my index finger.   Index finger on right hand, infected when worked as a dental assistant on patients.  This time they prescribed this cream and I noticed a great change. You never know what you're exposed to in the medical/ dental field. Gloves still tear. But luckily they are Meds to help. This product has lessened the swelling and throbbing.	7	December 14, 2019	5
Acyclovir topical	Zovirax Cream (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	I'm also from the UK and like most of the comments from the UK, the cream does not help. Again bought some and it seems to make it spread. I'm sure if I didn't use it it would not be as bad as it is this morning. Maybe there IS a difference between US and UK . I must remind myself not to bother with this again.... try something else... pity	1	December 5, 2019	9
Acyclovir topical	Cold Sores	I was prescribed Acyclovir Ointment 5%.  First of all, the tube was tiny and cost me $113.00.  Secondly, this cream did not work on my cold sore.  I followed the instructions and used it every 3 hours.  I am on day 8 of 10 and my cold sore is still there and does not look like it is healing.  Don't waste your money.  Use Abreva instead.	1	December 1, 2019	0
Acyclovir topical	Cold Sores	This is by far the best cold sore ingredient. The ointment+pills have worked wonders for me. I am never the person to leave reviews, but needed too for someone like you out there who's looking for a cure to Cold Sores. *ACYCLOVIR IS THE BEST*	10	September 25, 2019	2

Acyclovir topical	Zovirax Cream (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	You can buy this off the shelf in the UK, at any pharmacy and many supermarkets, for around £5 for a 2g pump. Worth stocking up if you're visiting from the US!!	10	July 4, 2019	8
Acyclovir topical	Zovirax Cream (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	Way better than abreva! 1 to 2 days max and it is gone.	10	December 28, 2018	11
Acyclovir topical	Zovirax Cream (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	Zorvirax duo honestly works wonders! As soon as I feel the tingling I lather it on and it’s gone the next day! There are also tablets that you can take but they only work if the cold sore hasn’t appeared yet and you’re only getting the tingling sensation. Just ask for them at your chemist. They’re 3 pills and you take them all at once and the cold sore doesn’t even come up. I got my lips done and I got a cold sore the next day used the cream and it was gone. I went to get them done a second time and took the tablets as a precaution and no cold sore even appeared! Love love love the cream!		December 10, 2018	8
Acyclovir topical	Zovirax Cream (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	I love Zovirax in the little pump. Clears up cold sores in 3 days. However I’ve noticed the amount of cream in the pump has become less. Disappointing.	8	December 10, 2018	8
Acyclovir topical	Cold Sores	Works every time if you get it at the first signs of a cold sore.  For US cold sore sufferers can who make it to Mexico, you can get it over the counter under a generic brand  for 65 pesos at any supermarket with a pharmacy - that is about $3 USD.	10	August 11, 2018	3
Acyclovir topical	Zovirax Cream (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	The cold sores usually don't even appear if I apply the cream at the first signs of tingling. Once, I failed to catch the tingly symptoms at the start, and only realised when my lips began to harden and split. I rushed to the pharmacy to purchase Zovirax, and I managed to dodge the embarrassing process of allowing the cold sore to fully blister and crust. I bet no one even suspected I had cold sores.  I don't know why everyone is comparing prices here, but it costs approximately USD $15 for a 2g tube where I come from. Just apply a little will do, I'm not sure why someone mentioned finishing the 2g tube within 3 days. It can last me two years, before it expires. Read the directions that it comes with.	10	July 19, 2018	7
Acyclovir topical	Zovirax Cream (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	Had a wedding and got a cold sore 3 says prior. Used the cream every half hour till the day. Totally disappeared. Couldn't even see them in the photos. Highly recommend to everyone.	10	June 22, 2018	13
Acyclovir topical	Zovirax Cream (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	This stuff is amazing does not burn, it heals the pain & cold sore		June 15, 2018	7
Acyclovir topical	Cold Sores	The best medicine for cold sores! I apply it as much as possible throughout the day and have never had a blister since using it. Would recommend it to everyone.	10	May 3, 2018	2
Acyclovir topical	Zovirax Cream (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	I just want to mention that in my country zovirax costs something like 10$ 10g! I cannot believe how expensive is in US. Thats insane	10	March 13, 2018	6
Acyclovir topical	Zovirax Cream (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	Zovirax cream is amazing.  I hardly ever get an actual cold sore anymore, because I apply the cream as soon as I feel any tingle and it prevents the outbreak. Well, 3 days ago, I missed the tingle because I had a huge pimple forming on my chin, just under my lip, and it was so painful that it masked the tingle on my lip.  By the time I woke up & realized what was happening, my lip had already swollen quite badly.  I was horrified & thought the battle was already lost, but I immediately started applying Zovirax.  My lip still swelled up to 3 times its size over the next 36 hours, but then it started to recede and never even blistered!  It is now 3 days after it started & my lip is almost back to normal.  I cannot believe it worked when the cold sore had already taken hold, and stopped the blisters from erupting.  I love this stuff so much!  It cost about $80 for a 5g tube the last time I bought it, but it lasts a long time for me.  I always carry it in my purse so I am armed for battle.	10	March 2, 2018	8
Acyclovir topical	Zovirax Cream (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	Zovirax works great on cold sores. I use at first sign for a few days and it doesn't even blister. If I get a blister it doesn't get big and dries up 2  to 3 days. Abreva never worked for me. This stuff is great	10	February 22, 2018	5
Acyclovir topical	Zovirax Cream (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	Zovirax does work. The trick is to apply small amounts as soon as possible and as often as possible. The more times you apply the more chances you have of healing quicker. Applying 3 x a day just aint going to cut it. (Every hour or less if you have to)		February 17, 2018	7
Acyclovir topical	Herpes Simplex	I use the generic brand by Mylan. This product is amazing. Even if you have a bad outbreak it cuts the healing time by a few days. That may seem minimal to some, but those who suffer from cold sores, this is superb. If you apply it during the first signs you will not even have an outbreak.	10	January 4, 2018	5
Acyclovir topical	Zovirax Cream (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	OMG LOL  extremely ridiculous how Zovirax cream expensive in USA  $700 plus!  Zovirax cream It costs in other countries  less than $20.00   It's very sad how they take  advantage of people here in USA.  Less than $20. Lol same Zovirax cream. Have mercy on people and stop using them like this!		December 16, 2017	6
Acyclovir topical	Herpes Simplex	I was diagnosed with genital herpes earlier today, though the symptoms began a month ago and I mistaken it for a yeast infection. The sores started last Monday (5 days ago).  The burning was so bad to the point where I had trouble walking. After applying acyclovir earlier I experienced moderate burning for a short amount of time but after sitting down for awhile I felt relief. let's hope that tomorrow the sores aren't as painful	7	November 26, 2017	9
Acyclovir topical	Zovirax Cream (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	My son had a cold sores out break, got a Zovirax cream as treatment. It works well but the cream ran out before cold sore. I paid $14 for a tube 2g of Zovirax, the amount of cream not even cover 3 days treatment. The tube with a size of lips sunscreen but the amount of cream inside is ridiculously tiny. Such a ripoff, please consider low income consumer with your products.	7	October 10, 2017	3
Acyclovir topical	Zovirax Cream (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	Zovirax cream has 50mg of acyclovir in it -doesn't it? It was in the contents ingredients information list.

Acyclovir topical	Zovirax Cream (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	I am 21 years old and just suffered from my first major breakout of cold sores in my life. It was pretty bad and I was frustrated from the unsightly sores appearing on my lips and mouth. I also had an outbreak just below my eye in the sensitive skin. I went to the doctor and she prescribed me with the Zovirax cream and I saw a lessened appearance in worst of the cold sores on my lip in less than 24 hours. While it takes time for them to heal, I definitely think this is a worthwhile drug. It cost me $45 so its not super cheap, but it really alleviated some of my symptoms. I had another cold sore forming on my lip just below the bad one and it stopped that one dead in its tracks and I already see it healing and not blistering. Worth it!	10	May 8, 2017	1
Acyclovir topical	Cold Sores	You are going to love this, my small tube of aciclovir ointment costs $900.  Welcome to 'Merica.  Luckily my insurance covered it or I would have lots of cold sores.  The stuff is marginally effective if you catch the cold sores at the right moment.  I am switching over to oral hoping for better results.  	4	April 10, 2017	0
Acyclovir topical	Zovirax Ointment (acyclovir) for Cold Sores	COLD SORE TREATMENTS AND PREVENTION THAT WORK: L-lysine: You can buy L-lysine over the counter in tablet form, one a day pretty much prevents cold sores from forming.  If you run out of tablets make sure you buy more; it's like the virus sits inactive under the skin just waiting for a break from the L-lysine treatment so it can raise it's ugly head.  ZOVIRAX: If you feel a cold sore coming on or you have a cold sore buy Zovirax from the chemist or supermarket ~$17 a tube; but you only need a little bit applied 5 or 6 times a day and the last application should be before you go to sleep (whenever you think of applying it really) Zovirax helps heal the blisters much faster than anything else l have tried. ICE OR COLD PACK: If you don't have Zovirax and the cold sore is really burning and itchy get a freezer bag or similar and put some ice in it or some frozen peas and apply that to the area until that nasty burning and itchy feeling eases. Avoid licking of playing with the blisters with your tongue, this tends to make them bigger. Pop the Blisters or Don't Pop the Blisters? This is a personal preference however,  l have found that by not popping the blisters only allows the blisters to grow bigger to the point of them sometimes joining together and becoming one big blister which takes a lot longer to heal, hence, l pop the blister and apply Zovirax straight away and the majority are gone within a few days. SAFETY FIRST: DO NOT have oral sex and AVOID kissing anyone when you have an active cold sore; they do spread as quickly as a peck on the lips from someone with the active cold sore virus and wash your hands if you touch your mouth by accident, this helps prevent spreading the cold sore virus. PREVENTION: Take L-lysine 1 tablet daily and try to avoid sudden drops in temperature, excessive sun or wind. Changes in climate conditions and temperature drops can bring on the cold sore virus. Avoid rubbing your lips hard like we sometimes do to remove stubborn lipstick and avoid the hard bristles of a man's beard or regrowth, both of these things can irritate the sensitive skin on our lips. Just be mindful of the cold sore virus and it will become second nature to prevent it from occurring.	10	March 20, 2017	19
Aczone		This made my acne 100 times worse. I broke out after using it for just a week and held out for a month. After that, I had to discontinue use- my skin kept getting worse.	1	February 25, 2021	6
Aczone		This Aczone destroyed my face. It made my acne way worse. I have huge cysts all around my face and this is the only change to my routine.   Please do not use this medication.	1	December 17, 2020	7
Aczone		Aczone  made my acne worse! My derm prescribed Aczone 5% (twice a day) for my adult nodulocystic cystic acne. He said my case was mild so I don’t really need the 7.5%. During the 1st week, I thought I found my holy grail. It dried my existing acne and redness was calmer. On the second week I started noticing new bumps on places I don’t normally get acne (forehead and temples). I thought it was just phase and waited and waited til it came to a point that I couldn’t go out of the house! On my 6th week I still see new breakouts and this time, they’re in clusters! Far worse than what I had. I never had this kind of flareup before. I called my derm to book an appt and the nurse just told me that Aczone wasn’t suppose to break me out and to stop using it. So I stopped, but boy The damage it did to my skin will not be an easy fix. I only used Aczone with a gentle cleanser and Avene Tolerance. These two have no actives and I’m very certain that it was aczone that caused these enormous acne!	1	September 22, 2020	13
Aczone		I give this medication a 2/10 because it didn’t do anything for me. I have mild acne that usually only flares around the time of my period. So my main concern was to curb my breakouts right before my period. I applied this medication religiously for over 3 months everyday as prescribed by my doctor in conjunction with other creams and saw absolutely no results. The acne did not get worse as other people here have reported but it did not get better. I saw absolutely no changes in the last 3 months of applying it. My acne would come and go depending on the time of month as it always did. So I am now considering discontinuing using this cream because it seems like a complete waste of my money. I read online that it is usually taken with oral meds for best results so maybe then it’s helpful when the other meds kick in. But as it is, on its own it doesn’t solve anything for me.	2	February 18, 2020	8
Aczone		Works great. Cerave I noticed moisturizer and face wash, hydrating and foaming caused my skin to become irritated and break out. Vanicream gently cleanser with aczone worked wonderfully along with cetaphil moisturizer with hylauronic.	10	February 10, 2020	8
Aczone		I struggled with acne from age 12-36. I tried everything from prescription creams to otc everything. A year ago my dermatologist put me on aldactone and raaczone therapy. Within a month my acne was gone. I haven't looked back. I wash with cetaphil twice daily,  use aczone at night, moisturize with cerave in the morning and exfoliate twice a week with a facial scrub. It's amazing!	10	January 29, 2020	7
Aczone		Every time I put this aczone to treat rosacea, people comment about how smooth and creamy my skin is.  Love it!	9	January 29, 2020	8
Aczone		35 years old, had bad acne on my checks and couldn't get rid of it with anything......tried Aczone (morning) and Clindamycin (night) and acne has disappeared completely.  It took about 6 weeks to see major results. Also, aczone didn't irritate my skin and make it peel off.	10	January 11, 2020	8
Aczone		Aczone is a great medication, it worked for my acne before years ago and when I started breaking out badly I recommended this to my new Derm. Saw results around 3 months, my skin is all clear now just have to PIH which is fading everyday. The aczone also helps with hyperpigmentation too. I use 7.5 morning and night and wait until it is dry before I apply My moisturizer. I am using murad skin perfecting oil free moisturizer. I also take spironolactone 75mg in the morning.  Some nights I will apply tretinoin on top of my aczone. I will Continue to use aczone forever. I know the first  two months can be annoying when you’re trying this medication and you are still Breaking out, even I was losing faith in it! Aczone reaches its peak around month 3-4. But don’t stop it is one of the few that works Probably as good as accutane!!	10	December 18, 2019	9
Aczone		I am a 23 yr old woman with dry-combination skin. I have slightly struggled with acne, mostly in my teen yrs. BUT once I turned 23, my acne flared up and I would constantly have 5-10 active pimples at a time. I decided to visit a dermatologist and I was prescribed Aczone 7.5% because my dermatologist said that I was suffering from hormonal breakouts. About a week after using Aczone, I started experiencing even worse breakouts, extremely oily skin, and the hyper pigmentation from healing acne lasting longer than ever (2-3 weeks). It did help cystic/nodule pimples heal faster but the oily-ness caused more whiteheads and blackheads. After using it for 5 weeks and seeing absolutely no improvement in my skin, I decided to stop. Within 1 week of stopping, my skin has is no longer oily, the hyper-pigmentation faded and I have less breakouts than I did before Aczone. Aczone did not work well with my skin, but each skin type is different, just wanted to share my experience.	4	December 11, 2019	8
Aczone		I use Neutrogena Fresh Foaming Cleanser, Aczone, and Neutrogena Oil Free SPF 15 moisturizer have healed my acne. I no longer get cystic acne or nodules. Occasionally I get pimples but this medication heals them in 1-2 days. Definitely worth the try!! Be careful what foundation brand you use to because that was the culprit to my acne as well. Fpr foundation I use Revelon’s  combination skin foundations and a foundation brush by Elf. Sharing because most people don’t post their success stories.	10	December 3, 2019	14
Aczone		I have had breakouts here and there, but started to get worse in my early twenties. I'm 22 now and have horrible breakouts before my period, with big whiteheads and cheek and chin break outs. My doctor prescribed aczone alongside an oral pill, novo-spirolactane. So far after 4 weeks, I am seeing noticeable improvement and my acne has faded into just red scars on my face that are easy to cover. I apply aczone once in the morning and night and sometimes on bigger pimples more throughout the day. Only thing is it's not as good for drying out large whiteheads.   10/10 would recommend you just have to be patient.	8	October 17, 2019	6
Aczone		I've had acne ever since I was 14, but throughout the years it just got worse and worse. February of 2019 my acne became the worst it has ever been, it affected my mood every day and sometimes to the point where I wouldn't want to leave my house. I went to the dermatologist and was prescribed Aczone along with another topical cream called Bianca ( which is a retinoid). The doctor told me to apply the Aczone in the morning and the Bianca and night, and as sceptical as I was about these creams let me just tell you they work. You have to be patient because it does get worse before it gets better. I started the medication in April and my skin didn't clear up until September but please do not give up on this medication because it saved my self-esteem. It's also important to remember to only put a pea-sized amount... when I first started I would put a lot more than required and it started to make my face oily which caused more breakouts. Use only a little bit and it goes a long way!	10	September 30, 2019	16
Aczone		In my teens, I never had acne. But when I went to college, I developed horrible cystic acne.  For the next 15 years, I tried EVERYTHING - oral antibiotics, topicals, extractions, Accutane (twice!), peels, etc. and nothing helped until I went on Spironolactone in my late 30s. However, 8 years on Spiro totally messed up my hormones and put me into early menopause. I started taking hormone replacement recently and the cystic acne was back with a vengeance. My derm suggested I try Aczone (along with a topical retinoid) and believe me - I was skeptical as no topical had ever done anything for me. Within two weeks - my acne was nearly gone - not just the big painful nodules but also the little hard milia. It has also cleared up my back acne. Give this stuff a try (especially before you go on Spiro) - I know how it feels to think that nothing will work but this really did.	9	September 24, 2019	31
Aczone		I’m a 21 year old female that started dealing with cystic acne mostly on my forehead out of nowhere. I never had problems with acne during puberty, so it was extremely unordinary. I was prescribed aczone and BAM! within a WEEK my acne seemed to have disappeared. I have now been clear for a year now. I will break out here and there, but it is only one or two. When that happens, I put extra aczone on as a spot treatment and it seems to stop it in its tracks. I’ve continued daily use for a year. I am scared to stop because I do not want my acne to come back. I use a tiny bit each day on my forehead. This is a MIRACLE product but the only downside is the price. BEYOND expensive. Thankfully my insurance covered majority of the cost but it was still about $80!!! I have been using the same container for about a year and still have some left so there is a bunch of product in there. If you are a post puberty woman I would highly recommend this product.	10	August 23, 2019	14
Aczone		BEST.ACNE.MEDICINE.EVER. I used Aczone for I’d say 2 months and boom, acne, GONE. I have been continuously using Aczone now for probably 4 years and it is still my tried and true. Whenever I do get a pimple here and there, I apply a dot of the product to the area a few times and day and within 24 hours it’s gone!	10	August 12, 2019	16
Aczone		I'm a 56 year old male and I've had adult acne and/or acne rosacea for the last 20 years.  I tried everything, including Metrogel, Soolantra, Finacea, and various antibiotics.  Finacea worked a little bit, but I still got some inflamed bumps.  Then I tried Aczone -- within 4 days it seemed to be working, and within a couple of weeks, I no longer woke up in the morning with new painful bumps forming.  I use a very small amount of the 7.5 strength twice a day, and it's been a complete game changer.  I'm finally happy with my complexion.  It's about time!	10	August 11, 2019	13
Aczone		The Aczone acne drug has done an amazing job with my stubborn acne.   I have battled acne for most of my adult life.  If you name it, I have tried it.   The only thing that worked was accutane. It completely cleared up my acne and then 2 years it came back largely due to me starting to get my hormones regulated by taking testosterone due to low levels.  The dermatologist suggested Aczone and Spirolactone.  Both drugs have done amazing things for my skin. Aczone works fast too.  I love the product.  My skin has some dark scarring but each day it has gone better and it's kept my acne to a minimal.  Customer for life.  Try it.  It really works.	9	August 5, 2019	9
Aczone		No itching at all, no dryness, no more redness.  Acne completely gone and no other topic medication was doing any good. Seemed impossible too treat. But aczone cleared it all ! I am so proud of my skin when I look at pictures of myself now. I don’t mind people looking at me closely. I am more than forty yrs old and I am more satisfied with my skin than for the last 25 years. I saw results in a month and it kept improving after that. Now, I’ve been using it for more than 6 months.	10	July 24, 2019	6
Aczone		At 33 years old I have had ENOUGH of my acne which seemed to get worse with age and since having children. I'm scheduled for laser treatments but in the mean time my derm had me try aczone. I didn't have much hope since I've been prescribed many other things by other doctors previously and I pretty much tried everything at Sephora and Ulta to no avail. Well I go for my first laser treatment in a week, I started the Aczone a month ago and even debated on not doing the laser treatment all! The only blemishes left are some really deep cysts that are still healing since before I started aczone! I had two breakouts right before my period this month which is unheard of for me and they came and went quicker than the breakouts I still have healing from two months ago. This has been a huge ego boost and I can't imagine not having this stuff now. Love it and no side effects at all.	8	July 6, 2019	6
Aczone		The Aczone made skin without acne look flawless however I still had acne	4	June 15, 2019	3
Aczone		This topical gel is incredible! My acne started to become an issue about a year ago and it has been an ongoing struggle to control/eliminate it.  I have tried many other topical creams as well as an oral antibiotic that worked for a short period of time.  However, my dermatologist finally prescribed the Aczone 5% gel and my skin has drastically cleared up within the past month or two.  I currently experience the occasional blemish, which comes in much smaller than before and it clears up quicker.  I highly recommend the Aczone gel for anyone with acne prone skin!	9	May 28, 2019	6
Aczone		I had clear skin until I had children and it has gotten worse over the years. I have now been suffering with acne for 20 years and it only gets worse. I have been using Aczone 7.5% for over a year twice daily. It does help shrink large inflamed cysts, but definitely doesn't stop the acne. I gave it 4 stars because it does help with inflammation and doesn't cause dryness or peeling, but if you are looking for something to prevent acne this isn't it.	4	May 3, 2019	6
Aczone		I have struggled with cystic acne my whole life (I am now 26 yrs old), and was desperate to find a topical that was effective. Aczone has been a game-changer for me! My breakouts have all but been eliminated-- and when they do occur (hormonally), they are much smaller and last for a shorter duration. I use it once daily, and it does not leave my skin dry or oily like most other topical ointments.		February 2, 2019	10
Aczone		I am a middle aged male and have been experiencing problems with acne for the past 8-10 years.  I have been on accutane 4 times and would exeperience clear skin for about a year every time after my treatment. My acne would always resurface, and it would be an uphill battle to keep it at bay. I would also like to add that I experienced breakouts most frequently during the winter months.  After habitually visiting my dermatologist, I was finally prescribed Aczone but did not expect much from topical treatment.   I have been applying for about six months and my skin is not only completely clear, but I am able to actually touch my face and eat foods I NEVER use to eat in the past.   I strongly recommend this product to any male experiencing the problems I have. Acne is the most frustrating situation I had facee, and it killed my self esteem.  If you have severe cystic acne, I suggest you clear it up with accutane and immediately switch to dapsone to keep it under control.	9	January 17, 2019	23
Aczone		If you have never used this product, try it.  It might just turn out its works just as good for you as it did for me! All I can say is, it works, it works, it works.  I have tried so many things including other RX that didn't have any results. I am 40, and used aczone (dapsone) gel for 3+ years now. The results are awesome, and yes I had every type of acne you can think of everyday since a teenager. Since using this medication once a day I have NO acne, zero. Even scarring is reduced. Talk to your doctor,, and all the best for success using this!	10	December 17, 2018	19
Aczone		At the end of October my almost 14 year old who had always had such great skin started to have terrible breakouts.  We tried so many OTC products and she cut out sugar, dairy, and would drink gallons of water each day and it seemed to get worse.  I took her to a wonderful dermatologist on Nov. 26 and she prescribed Aczone 7.5%. She started using it that night.  She has not skipped one night and after 2 1/2 weeks her skin looks SO GOOD!  The reviews are right, you won't see immediate results, you have to BE PATIENT.  She continued getting a new pimple almost everyday for the first 2 weeks, but they cleared up so fast and the last 4 days she hasn't gotten anything new and everything else has faded.  She washes her face with Cetaphil, waits 20 minutes to apply the Aczone, then waits another 30 before applying her Cetaphil night cream moisturizer.  She plans on using this for a very long time!  Please don't give up right away,  I know it takes a little longer for some people.	10	December 14, 2018	22
Aczone		Great product. First off, Aczone will not give you immediate results. That’s for sure. But it IS worth the wait. Prior to Aczone, I had tried EVERYTHING. Over the counter, prescriptions, professionally done facials, you name it. I was given Aczone 2 & 1/2 months ago in combination with Sulfacleanse (a wash I use once a day) and my skin is almost completely clear. I also take Minocycline twice a day. It definitely doesn’t guarantee perfect skin but you WILL see a huge improvement.	8	November 30, 2018	8
Aczone		I have tried every recommended acne product whether it be topical or tablets and this is the only thing that has worked INCREDIBLY well for me. I was prescribed this in August 2018 along with Spironolactone (commonly used for high blood pressure but works to kill acne by slowing down oil production) and my skin is perfect right now. I'm not going to lie it was a little rough in the beginning 1-2 months in I was getting quite a few pimples, many flare-ups randomly. But it went by so fast I don't discourage this product because of that. I went from not wanting to go out of the house most of the time to leaving with no makeup on every day, you need to try this! The only negative thing is that the Aczone is expensive. My insurance doesn't cover it but it's so worth it to me. Hope this helps!	10	November 27, 2018	15
Aczone		I randomly started having moderate cystic acne when I turned 20 and tried everything over the counter.  I finally went to the derm and got 20 mg doxy twice a day along with tretinoin cream .25% at night. It helped a little but not to my liking... she then gave me aczone and my skin cleared up so fast. I have been clear for about 3 weeks now for the first time in at least a year. I am still on all other medications (doxy and tret cream) and am so happy I started to use aczone. I am wondering, has anyone got clear skin with aczone? Also what happened when you stopped using it, did the acne come back?	9	November 6, 2018	4
Aczone		Growing up I has always had clear skin, and then at the age of 22 my skin FREAKED out. I had extremely bad hormonal acne, at least 14 white heads at a time that hurt so bad. I didn’t even want to leave the house. A dermatologist prescribed aczone and benzoyl peroxide face wash and iIswear that the aczone is what saved my face. My face is 100% clear now in just a few months. Just a few red marks that still need to fade are left. aczone gave me my confidence back.	9	November 2, 2018	9
Aczone		The first time i used this product, I used it with tazorac, and it cleared my skin up nicely. I have had trouble with acne on and off since I was a teen. It cleared my acne up in a few weeks but completely dried my skin out around my mouth. My lips started peeling and turning brown even lipstick didn't help. Derm recommended cutting back use to every other day. Didn't help. I stopped altogether and my lips and mouth area returned back to normal. 5-6 months later I started aczone again since my acne has gotten so bad. I made sure to stay away from my lips etc, got a great moisturizer to keep area hydrated and now I have a red rash around my lips and nose and on my lips.... guess I'm having some weird reaction. :(	3	October 26, 2018	7
Aczone		TRY IT OUT! I'm a mid-30 yo female that has always been acne free. Stress and bacterial infection from clarisonic caused acne break out all over forehead and cheeks. My dermatologist has put me on Solodyn 55mg and Aczone 7.5% once a day. Here's my routine: Daytime - Purpose facewash, Kiehl's calendula toner, Aveeno posivitely radiant spf30 moisturizer. Nightime - Purpose facewash, kiehl's calendula toner, Aczone, after 5 minutes CeraVe oilfree PM moisturizer, oral Solodyn. I have been applying Aczone for 2 weeks and it has drastically brought down the inflammation along with clearing some stubborn acne. I still have a ways to go, but this has made me feel so much better about my skin! Side note: 60gram bottle dispenses 0.8% - so it should last you 75+ days and the cost of Aczone without insurance is $75 - I called Allergan directly to get this info. Definitely try this out if you are dealing with inflamed, red, angry acne! I'll do another review at the month mark!	10	October 15, 2018	7
Aczone		I’m 53 and my husband and I moved out of state because he got transferred and there was a lot of stress. I started breaking out so badly. I was freaking. As soon as we got settled in Tennessee I got to a dermatologist. She put me on Aczone 7.5 and it’s amazing. I had to be patient because it did take a few months but it’s so worth it. I’ll never not stop using it. My skin at 53 is more tone and beautiful then it was in my 20s!!	10	October 11, 2018	6
Aczone		do not use this medication. I've been on it for months & I have worst acne than I ever have had! Find something else	1	September 30, 2018	4
Aczone		I normally never write reviews, but this acne medication warrants it. I suffered the worst breakout of my life in May. I had tried everything under the sun to get my acne better. I was embarrassed to go outside my breakout was so bad. So, I went to the dermatologist and they prescribed me aczone.   I put it on when I got home, and my acne started to get better pretty much right away. It still took a long time for my acne to get better- honestly 4 months- but it did it's job and my skin has never been clearer. I would not have been able to break the acne cycle without aczone.	10	September 13, 2018	11
Aczone		Only reason I am sharing this experience is because I've literally tried everything and anything you can imagine to get my skin clear.I have a stressful job which doesn't help either. I tried spirolactone which made my face even worse, and have tried every prescription face cream there is. I have very sensitive skin that is sensitive to hormonal changes. I went to the derm to get a cortizone shot for a huge cyst and was not planning on going on a new prescription cream until she recommended Aczone. At first I said no and accepted the fact that my skin was never going to be where I wanted it to be, but she gave me a sample to try before buying just in case. I was bored one night and decided to start trying it- what else do I have to loose?  After 3-4 weeks of Aczone, this changed my skin. I haven't had a prescription cream work this well and I am almost scared to post this to jinx it- but if you've tried everything and just given up, please try this.	9	September 13, 2018	14
Aczone		I have been on this gel since a few years back when I first started to experience bad breakouts. I was started at the 1% gel, and saw very little difference. In the past year, I have been prescribed antibiotics, tazorac, even switching my diet as well as many other things to help my skin, and nothing worked. In the past few months, my dermatologist has had me on the Aczone 7.5% gel and this has worked amazing for my skin. I've experienced no purging or flakiness, and it has worked wonders for my skin. Although it works well I do suggest that you use a heavy moisturizer on top after it dries off if you are concerned about having dry skin. It has helped to control my breakouts, but takes significantly longer to get rid of larger cystic acne. Overall, this product has worked amazing	8	September 6, 2018	3
Aczone		Growing up, I never had acne. It wasn’t until I turned 30, then all of sudden my face started breaking out all over my cheeks, chin and jawline. Hopeless, I went to a dermatologist who prescribed me Aczone 5% to be applied nightly along with a daily face wash and morning moisturizer. I’ve been on this regiment for 1 month and after using it every day without skipping, my face is clean and completely clear! I will say, however, that you NEED to be patient. After the second week, I noticed a heavier breakout in odd places, but my doctor told me that this would happen so I stuck it out. Most acne medications will not provide you with instant results as they need to remove the junk from your skin first. This is why you will break out around the second or third week. It may seem bad, but trust me, it just means it’s working! By the time the second week was over, I was left with some scarring, but continuing on with this product even diminished those as well!	10	August 26, 2018	12
Aczone		I started to experience acne when I turned 11. Seems like the acne kicked into full throttle when the later stages of puberty began. And it’s been a battle so far. When I finally decided to visit the dermatologist, they prescribed me Doxy & Aczone. At first when I used the Aczone it made my skin look great. Better than it had in awhile, it seemed it was lighting the tone of my red spots! I’ve been on it for 2 and a half weeks & my face is AWFUL. (Now yes I do understand there is a purging period, so I’m gonna keep going, unless I don’t see better results in 4 weeks). I can tell it’s not my classic acne, because it feels buried under the skin. I highly recommend you try this product. Though it does leave blemishes from causing all of the rising to the skin, I believe it is working. But then comes my question. The Doxycycline takes around 6 weeks to fully kick in, and maybe I don’t need the Aczone. Because from what I can see, it’s causing my face to scar SO MUCH easier		August 15, 2018	2
Aczone		I am 24 years old, african american female with caramel skin.  I have been on topical medications for my moderate hormonal acne. About a year ago my skin went crazy, went back to a dermatologist and was prescribed Aczone 7.5 gel. I 100% always look up reviews before I use a product, so I felt the need to write a review for my experience. It's literally amazing. You do go through a purging period but please stick with it. It's been 4 months, and my face is beautiful & clear again. Just have a couple of dark spots, but all in all I'm really happy with the results. Every now & then I get a breakout but it clears up quickly. It goes on smooth under makeup. Skin rountine am: neutrogena acne prone facial bar, aczone, (wait 10 mins) then apply moisturizer. At night wash face & put some retin-a cream for my dark spots. I use aczone only once a day. Please give it the full 12 weeks to clear you up, it works!!! I hope this review helped, the same way other reviewers helped me stick with it!	9	August 9, 2018	23
Aczone		Aczone has been a miracle treatment option for my inflammation based, hormonal, PCOS facial acne. It clears up my acne literally overnight without drying out my skin like tretinoin cream does. It also does a superb job of clearing red splotches on my face and evening out my skin tone. There is no other acne treatment that has evened my skin tone. I really love this stuff! The ONLY downside is that it it so, so, so expensive.	9	May 23, 2018	7
Aczone		I started using this when the dermatologist prescribed it to me and at first it worked okay. But three weeks in it caused me to break out and I now have the worst acne I have ever had because of this product.	2	May 3, 2018	6
Aczone		It's been 1 week and not joking my acne has dried up. Its a miracle cream. I apply at night so I didn’t have to worry much about applying anything on the top of it. My only complaint is that acne scar are not fading away. Might be I have to wait for months but I expected the result quick. Anyways only scarring is left on my face otherwise all the bumpy acne are dried up.  I will increase my rating once I clear up all my scares within a month.	6	April 17, 2018	2
Aczone		I never suffered too much from acne as a teenager. I would get some breakouts here and there before my period. It wasn't until I was 24 that I started getting bad acne on my cheeks. I went to a dermatologist and she said it was hormonal. She did prescribe me antibiotics and aczone. At first it did burn when I put it on because I had a lot of acne on my cheeks. It does take about two months to see a complete change but it's completely worth it. My skin is the best it's ever been.	10	March 12, 2018	5
Aczone		I started having adult acne after stopping birth control. I tried atraline and it helped for a while but my face always peeled. It never adjusted as promised. Then the acne came back. I was put on an antibiotic. It helped. A lot. But then I had to stop taking it because you can't take those long term. My doctor then suggested aczone and it's been the best thing I've ever tried. No acne and no peeling skin.	10	December 27, 2017	6
Aczone		I’ve been using aczone 7.5% gel once a day full face and my skin has never been clearer. I didn’t have much acne as a teen, only small pimples on my forehead, but once I hit my early 20’s I started getting breakouts all over, specifically cysts and pimples on my chin and center cheeks. I soon realized this was probably hormonal acne and after trying prescriptions such as epiduo forte and veltin, I realized that products that dry out my skin are not the answer. After hearing that aczone had been seen to help women with hormonal acne AND doesn’t have a drying effect like most other acne products, I had to give it a try. Not only did it clear my hormonal acne, but even took care of the small pimples I had since my teen years. Simply amazing!!!	10	December 19, 2017	6
Aczone		I'm a 59 year old woman and have never experienced an acne problem until recently.    Two weeks ago my Dermatologist prescribed Aczone gel 7.5 to be used once a day.   I have noticed a substantial decrease in my breakouts.   I know it's early in my use, but as of today I would give this a high rating.    I will report back after a more extended use of the product.	6	December 18, 2017	4
Aczone		"Had acne in my 20's, now the painful cystic acne in T-zone is back during menopause.  I've been using aczone for about 2 weeks, once or twice a day.  Results: I have no - NO - bad breakouts and the ones I had are almost completely healed. The only reason I didn't give this a 10 is because it's only been 2 weeks and I don't know that I won't have another breakout tomorrow.   But knock wood, ""so far, so good""."	9	October 29, 2017	7
Aczone		I've been using Aczone twice a day for 4 and a half weeks for my red pimples. When I went to my dermatologist she put a needle in each pimple it was a medicine which helped a little bit. And ever since using aczone nothing worked. It clearly says after a specific period of time if the cream doesn't work change it to a new cream or gel. This cream is not so great. Giorgio armani CC cream works for my skin way better, and the dior nude air powder is great for my oily skin.  I will definitely get a different  prescription cream.	4	October 21, 2017	1
Aczone		Works well for my cystic acne. Non drying. Also have noticed that it has helped to even out my skin tone.	9	October 20, 2017	5
Aczone		I had an adult onset of acne at age 37. Out of nowhere I had 10 to 15 pimples on my face... minimum. I made an appointment with my dermatologist. She put me on Aczone. I used the coupon online and got it for my co-pay (much cheaper... as it is pricey). I used it once a day. At first my face dried up and my acne increased. However, after a month I went acne free...since 2013! If you can get past the first month... you will be all clear! However, once your face is clear you may be tempted to stop! Please don’t... as acne may return and you’ll have to start all over. Just my 2 cents!	10	October 14, 2017	15
Aczone		So I'm almost a month into using aczone twice a day and minocycline 100mg twice a day. So my face us actually getting worst 	1	September 10, 2017	6
Aczone		So I recently visited a dermatologist due to hormonal acne. Never before did I have to worry so much about my skin that it would drastically affect my mood, social life, etc. I've spent so much money on better skincare, higher end and full coverage foundations - nothing was working (tea tree oil, spot treatment, apple cider vinegar, legit tried everything). The derm prescribed me 100mg of Spironolactone - but said it takes a few weeks to kick in. I'm on my third week and honestly not many changes. In addition she prescribed me Aczone. I don't know if this is just not strong enough for deep acne, but I apply this gel on my affected area multiple times a day and it has not gotten better. I think it may be better for smaller whiteheads, etc.	5	September 7, 2017	3
Aczone		I have used Aczone 5% for over 2 years. It worked pretty well to manage minor breakouts and is much less abrasive than other topical acne treatments (both OTC and prescription). I still struggled with cystic acne, so my dermatologist also prescribed an oral medaction called Spironolactone. I take 50mg 1 daily. Boy does that really help my cystic acne! That medication when used as prescribed at higher dosages is to treat high blood pressure, but it has been found that in doses 50-100mg to treat cystic acne.  I have extremely sensitive skin and have to be careful with what products I put on my face. I recently made the change to the 7.5% and am experiencing some redness and irritation. Does anyone know if this will subside overtime?	8	August 23, 2017	4
Aczone		I have been experiencing cystic acne for about 3 months now. My doctor had put on adaphlene cream and doxy antibiotic pills the first 2 months which basically purge out all sorts of acne. I was aware that it takes roughly 12 weeks to see results but I was just getting worse. My doctor ended up referring me to a Dermatologist who told me to continue with the adaphlene cream 0.1% at night. He took me off of the doxy antibiotic and prescribe me the minocycline 50mg 2 times a day and Aczone gel 7.5 once day as well as wash my face with Benozoyl Peroxide wash. The acne is almost gone after only being on the new medications 2 weeks. All I have left now is the horrible hyperpigmentation from the acne and it seems to be fading gradually too.	7	August 9, 2017	8
Aczone		So I have used the samples of this medication and it worked great, but recently I got my prescription filled for it and it seemed to exacerbate cystic acne on my neck, jawline. I read the ingredients and it contains a form of silicone that can worsen cystic acne. Is the sample formulation different or did they change the ingredients recently?	4	August 8, 2017	5
Aczone		I didn't find this helped at all. Made it so much worse if anything. Until I came across a mudmask and a blemish treatment which I was told would help out a whole lot. And it did. Because of the mask being made from all natural ingredients... it cleaned it up a treat... whilst removing all my blackheads at the same time! It's definitely the best thing ever for drawing all the crap out!!	2	August 8, 2017	6
Aczone		Help! My skin seemed to be normal with few breakouts... I started aczone 7.5 and it is terrible! Pimples and redness all over my face! Is this normal?!? Should I wait it out?! It's been about 3 weeks.	1	August 7, 2017	8
Aczone		I cannot tell you how this product helped me. Background: I am 32 years old, never had acne until 30 years old. I went to the doctor and tried this out; it worked miracles. My faced purged for about a month, but I let it do its thing. If you use this the way you are suppose to, then this should cure it. I have used it for about 2 months. Yes, my face got dry, it purged, it got red, but it goes away. If you wanna put make up on after the cream, you must wait at least 30 minutes after application. I swear by this cream; my dermatologist, Dr.Brown. This cream takes time; you are not gonna see results right away. Just like any cream, machine(clearisonic) needs to purge all your pimples and the ones that are embedded in your skin.	10	August 3, 2017	13
Aczone		Aczone kills periodic break outs for me. Only on the very spot though! Otherwise I wash with dial antibacterial soap everyday as a friend with acne told me about when I was 13 and I don't have many breakouts ever. Unless it's PMS, drinking Coke or anything with caramel color in it, or too much chocolate. One tube has lasted me 3 years!!!		July 28, 2017	6
Aczone		I was put on aczone 5% about 2 years ago and it didn't really do much. I had tried everything (and I mean everything, changing my BC, proactive, you name it). My dermo put me on tretinoin .025% and my face started breaking out like crazy. I stuck with it for about a month and then I called my dermo really upset. They moved me to aczone 7.5% and tretinoin .05% and I stuck with that for about 6 months. Oh. my god. I haven't gotten a single pimple in 3 months, all my scars are gone, my skin looks AMAZING. I honestly never thought I would have clear skin in my life and I feel like I found the holy grail. It really sucks for about 2 months when you go through the purge and your skin dries out, but it is SOO worth it. I promise.		May 29, 2017	25
Aczone		I am a 25 y/o African american female and I never had to see a dermatologist up until Nov 2016 because my face had turned for the worst after quitting BC! I had huge PAINFUL cystic acne on my jawline and cheeks(hormonal). My first few visits to the derm I was recommended the normal cetaphil, & topical & oral clindamycin. FAIL. I was prescribed Aczone 5% (once a day) in March 2017 & my skin is on its way to being flawless! It DEFINITELY gets worse between weeks 2-5, like additional acne in places I never had it before worse, but it will get better! DON'T QUIT! I'm on week 8 now. I may get a tiny pimple or 2 here & there but thats it. I will say that I upped my dose to 2x a day & still use the cetaphil prior. I'm happy I didn't have to resort to spiro =)	8	May 24, 2017	21
Aczone		The best ever!!!!	10	May 22, 2017	3
Aczone		I don't know why I've continued to use this, for what seems like years. I stayed with the 5% gel. While it's worked very well keeping breakouts at bay and my shoulders and chest, it has been not good for my face. I just keep getting pimples and excessive oil saturation. I very recently was upped to the 7.5% and that seems worse. I think it just is too harsh or just not effective for my face. I tried just using it every other day, but it seems the morning after I've used it, there are new pimples.	4	May 13, 2017	6
Aczone		I was originally using a combination of benzoyl peroxide and tactuo but was still breaking out a bit and wanted to see if there was something else that could clear my skin up even more. I was prescribed aczone and was instructed to use it every morning in replacement of my benzoyl peroxide. After two and a half month of using aczone my skin is the worst it's been in years. I have breakouts all over my face. I am incredibly disappointed with this product.	1	May 10, 2017	4
Aczone		Aczone is a mediocre and overpriced topical medication, distributed by a greedy pharmaceutical company named Allergan. Spend your money on a better product that doesn't cost you $900/year (with insurance!!!) I'm switching back to Finacea, which is just as good on my skin and doesn't break the bank.	1	April 25, 2017	7
Aczone		My face looks terrible. I do not recommend. I have pimples where I didn't have beforehand.	1	April 24, 2017	6
Aczone		I started using Aczone about 2 weeks ago. My derm added this to my other prescriptions (prescription benzoyl peroxide wash 5%, and adapalene gel) I have been seeing a dermatologist since I was a sophomore in high school and I am 25 years old now with acne as bad as a high schooler. I've used sooooo many prescriptions and been put on antibiotics and nothing has changed. So my derm suggested I try aczone. This has made my face absolutely terrible with break outs. I called my dermatologIst and spoke to the nurse who said this is normal and it will get worse before it gets better. Has anyone else had this experience using aczone? And for anyone who's insurance did not cover thos, just go to their website. I paid about 35 dollars.	1	April 18, 2017	15
Aczone		While the gel itself had marginal results with my acne, the fact that it is SO expensive AND has completely ruined all the towels that it came in contact with has caused me to stop using it.  If you use it, use towels that you don't care about because it will discolor them.  I didn't have issues with clothing or bed sheets, but I think that was by luck/chance.	3	April 3, 2017	3
Aczone		I'm an 18 year old female and I've always struggled with  occasional acne it would come and go, but recently I was breaking out and picking my face constantly which made it worst. I had many self esteem problems bc of this and had trouble going out bc of the way I looked, a couple of weeks ago a friend gave me some Aczone samples and I've been applying it twice a day and the results have been incredible it cleans out my pores like never before and I've tried many products but nothing like this! it does take a day or two for the swelling of the inflamed pore to go down in size so have patience.		April 3, 2017	8
Aczone		I used this product for about 6 months. I have very sensitive skin (benzoyl peroxide is my biggest allergen) Aczone gave me a similar reaction to benzoyl: dry burning red patches all over my face. not good if your skin is sensitive and prone to rashes.	2	March 29, 2017	4
Aczone		I went back to my dermatologist because of hormonal acne.  I currently was only using clear and clear benzoyl peroxide (5%) and aveno moisturizer (with .5% salicylic acid). I have a lot of under the skin deep rooted pimples under my chin that have been here for over 3 years. The dermatologist I went to said the aczone would help with my deep rooted hormonal acne. He told me to apply a small pea size amount over my entire face. He took me off my clean and clear face wash which was actually keeping my acne at bay... I honestly am so disgusted by Aczone. It made me break out into huge pimples on the side of my face where I never had pimples before - EVER. I am still breaking out on the sides of my face! Was on this product for 4 months...!	2	March 16, 2017	6
Aczone		I have breakouts at 59 and my dermatologist handed me samples.  I love Aczone.	10	March 13, 2017	6
Aczone (Topical)		This made my acne 100 times worse. I broke out after using it for just a week and held out for a month. After that, I had to discontinue use- my skin kept getting worse.	1	February 25, 2021	6
Aczone (Topical)		This Aczone destroyed my face. It made my acne way worse. I have huge cysts all around my face and this is the only change to my routine.   Please do not use this medication.	1	December 17, 2020	7
Aczone (Topical)		Aczone  made my acne worse! My derm prescribed Aczone 5% (twice a day) for my adult nodulocystic cystic acne. He said my case was mild so I don’t really need the 7.5%. During the 1st week, I thought I found my holy grail. It dried my existing acne and redness was calmer. On the second week I started noticing new bumps on places I don’t normally get acne (forehead and temples). I thought it was just phase and waited and waited til it came to a point that I couldn’t go out of the house! On my 6th week I still see new breakouts and this time, they’re in clusters! Far worse than what I had. I never had this kind of flareup before. I called my derm to book an appt and the nurse just told me that Aczone wasn’t suppose to break me out and to stop using it. So I stopped, but boy The damage it did to my skin will not be an easy fix. I only used Aczone with a gentle cleanser and Avene Tolerance. These two have no actives and I’m very certain that it was aczone that caused these enormous acne!	1	September 22, 2020	13
Aczone (Topical)		I give this medication a 2/10 because it didn’t do anything for me. I have mild acne that usually only flares around the time of my period. So my main concern was to curb my breakouts right before my period. I applied this medication religiously for over 3 months everyday as prescribed by my doctor in conjunction with other creams and saw absolutely no results. The acne did not get worse as other people here have reported but it did not get better. I saw absolutely no changes in the last 3 months of applying it. My acne would come and go depending on the time of month as it always did. So I am now considering discontinuing using this cream because it seems like a complete waste of my money. I read online that it is usually taken with oral meds for best results so maybe then it’s helpful when the other meds kick in. But as it is, on its own it doesn’t solve anything for me.	2	February 18, 2020	8
Aczone (Topical)		Works great. Cerave I noticed moisturizer and face wash, hydrating and foaming caused my skin to become irritated and break out. Vanicream gently cleanser with aczone worked wonderfully along with cetaphil moisturizer with hylauronic.	10	February 10, 2020	8
Aczone (Topical)		I struggled with acne from age 12-36. I tried everything from prescription creams to otc everything. A year ago my dermatologist put me on aldactone and raaczone therapy. Within a month my acne was gone. I haven't looked back. I wash with cetaphil twice daily,  use aczone at night, moisturize with cerave in the morning and exfoliate twice a week with a facial scrub. It's amazing!	10	January 29, 2020	7
Aczone (Topical)		Every time I put this aczone to treat rosacea, people comment about how smooth and creamy my skin is.  Love it!	9	January 29, 2020	8
Aczone (Topical)		35 years old, had bad acne on my checks and couldn't get rid of it with anything......tried Aczone (morning) and Clindamycin (night) and acne has disappeared completely.  It took about 6 weeks to see major results. Also, aczone didn't irritate my skin and make it peel off.	10	January 11, 2020	8
Aczone (Topical)		Aczone is a great medication, it worked for my acne before years ago and when I started breaking out badly I recommended this to my new Derm. Saw results around 3 months, my skin is all clear now just have to PIH which is fading everyday. The aczone also helps with hyperpigmentation too. I use 7.5 morning and night and wait until it is dry before I apply My moisturizer. I am using murad skin perfecting oil free moisturizer. I also take spironolactone 75mg in the morning.  Some nights I will apply tretinoin on top of my aczone. I will Continue to use aczone forever. I know the first  two months can be annoying when you’re trying this medication and you are still Breaking out, even I was losing faith in it! Aczone reaches its peak around month 3-4. But don’t stop it is one of the few that works Probably as good as accutane!!	10	December 18, 2019	9
Aczone (Topical)		I am a 23 yr old woman with dry-combination skin. I have slightly struggled with acne, mostly in my teen yrs. BUT once I turned 23, my acne flared up and I would constantly have 5-10 active pimples at a time. I decided to visit a dermatologist and I was prescribed Aczone 7.5% because my dermatologist said that I was suffering from hormonal breakouts. About a week after using Aczone, I started experiencing even worse breakouts, extremely oily skin, and the hyper pigmentation from healing acne lasting longer than ever (2-3 weeks). It did help cystic/nodule pimples heal faster but the oily-ness caused more whiteheads and blackheads. After using it for 5 weeks and seeing absolutely no improvement in my skin, I decided to stop. Within 1 week of stopping, my skin has is no longer oily, the hyper-pigmentation faded and I have less breakouts than I did before Aczone. Aczone did not work well with my skin, but each skin type is different, just wanted to share my experience.	4	December 11, 2019	8
Aczone (Topical)		I use Neutrogena Fresh Foaming Cleanser, Aczone, and Neutrogena Oil Free SPF 15 moisturizer have healed my acne. I no longer get cystic acne or nodules. Occasionally I get pimples but this medication heals them in 1-2 days. Definitely worth the try!! Be careful what foundation brand you use to because that was the culprit to my acne as well. Fpr foundation I use Revelon’s  combination skin foundations and a foundation brush by Elf. Sharing because most people don’t post their success stories.	10	December 3, 2019	14
Aczone (Topical)		I have had breakouts here and there, but started to get worse in my early twenties. I'm 22 now and have horrible breakouts before my period, with big whiteheads and cheek and chin break outs. My doctor prescribed aczone alongside an oral pill, novo-spirolactane. So far after 4 weeks, I am seeing noticeable improvement and my acne has faded into just red scars on my face that are easy to cover. I apply aczone once in the morning and night and sometimes on bigger pimples more throughout the day. Only thing is it's not as good for drying out large whiteheads.   10/10 would recommend you just have to be patient.	8	October 17, 2019	6
Aczone (Topical)		I've had acne ever since I was 14, but throughout the years it just got worse and worse. February of 2019 my acne became the worst it has ever been, it affected my mood every day and sometimes to the point where I wouldn't want to leave my house. I went to the dermatologist and was prescribed Aczone along with another topical cream called Bianca ( which is a retinoid). The doctor told me to apply the Aczone in the morning and the Bianca and night, and as sceptical as I was about these creams let me just tell you they work. You have to be patient because it does get worse before it gets better. I started the medication in April and my skin didn't clear up until September but please do not give up on this medication because it saved my self-esteem. It's also important to remember to only put a pea-sized amount... when I first started I would put a lot more than required and it started to make my face oily which caused more breakouts. Use only a little bit and it goes a long way!	10	September 30, 2019	16
Aczone (Topical)		In my teens, I never had acne. But when I went to college, I developed horrible cystic acne.  For the next 15 years, I tried EVERYTHING - oral antibiotics, topicals, extractions, Accutane (twice!), peels, etc. and nothing helped until I went on Spironolactone in my late 30s. However, 8 years on Spiro totally messed up my hormones and put me into early menopause. I started taking hormone replacement recently and the cystic acne was back with a vengeance. My derm suggested I try Aczone (along with a topical retinoid) and believe me - I was skeptical as no topical had ever done anything for me. Within two weeks - my acne was nearly gone - not just the big painful nodules but also the little hard milia. It has also cleared up my back acne. Give this stuff a try (especially before you go on Spiro) - I know how it feels to think that nothing will work but this really did.	9	September 24, 2019	31
Aczone (Topical)		I’m a 21 year old female that started dealing with cystic acne mostly on my forehead out of nowhere. I never had problems with acne during puberty, so it was extremely unordinary. I was prescribed aczone and BAM! within a WEEK my acne seemed to have disappeared. I have now been clear for a year now. I will break out here and there, but it is only one or two. When that happens, I put extra aczone on as a spot treatment and it seems to stop it in its tracks. I’ve continued daily use for a year. I am scared to stop because I do not want my acne to come back. I use a tiny bit each day on my forehead. This is a MIRACLE product but the only downside is the price. BEYOND expensive. Thankfully my insurance covered majority of the cost but it was still about $80!!! I have been using the same container for about a year and still have some left so there is a bunch of product in there. If you are a post puberty woman I would highly recommend this product.	10	August 23, 2019	14
Aczone (Topical)		BEST.ACNE.MEDICINE.EVER. I used Aczone for I’d say 2 months and boom, acne, GONE. I have been continuously using Aczone now for probably 4 years and it is still my tried and true. Whenever I do get a pimple here and there, I apply a dot of the product to the area a few times and day and within 24 hours it’s gone!	10	August 12, 2019	16
Aczone (Topical)		I'm a 56 year old male and I've had adult acne and/or acne rosacea for the last 20 years.  I tried everything, including Metrogel, Soolantra, Finacea, and various antibiotics.  Finacea worked a little bit, but I still got some inflamed bumps.  Then I tried Aczone -- within 4 days it seemed to be working, and within a couple of weeks, I no longer woke up in the morning with new painful bumps forming.  I use a very small amount of the 7.5 strength twice a day, and it's been a complete game changer.  I'm finally happy with my complexion.  It's about time!	10	August 11, 2019	13
Aczone (Topical)		The Aczone acne drug has done an amazing job with my stubborn acne.   I have battled acne for most of my adult life.  If you name it, I have tried it.   The only thing that worked was accutane. It completely cleared up my acne and then 2 years it came back largely due to me starting to get my hormones regulated by taking testosterone due to low levels.  The dermatologist suggested Aczone and Spirolactone.  Both drugs have done amazing things for my skin. Aczone works fast too.  I love the product.  My skin has some dark scarring but each day it has gone better and it's kept my acne to a minimal.  Customer for life.  Try it.  It really works.	9	August 5, 2019	9
Aczone (Topical)		No itching at all, no dryness, no more redness.  Acne completely gone and no other topic medication was doing any good. Seemed impossible too treat. But aczone cleared it all ! I am so proud of my skin when I look at pictures of myself now. I don’t mind people looking at me closely. I am more than forty yrs old and I am more satisfied with my skin than for the last 25 years. I saw results in a month and it kept improving after that. Now, I’ve been using it for more than 6 months.	10	July 24, 2019	6
Aczone (Topical)		At 33 years old I have had ENOUGH of my acne which seemed to get worse with age and since having children. I'm scheduled for laser treatments but in the mean time my derm had me try aczone. I didn't have much hope since I've been prescribed many other things by other doctors previously and I pretty much tried everything at Sephora and Ulta to no avail. Well I go for my first laser treatment in a week, I started the Aczone a month ago and even debated on not doing the laser treatment all! The only blemishes left are some really deep cysts that are still healing since before I started aczone! I had two breakouts right before my period this month which is unheard of for me and they came and went quicker than the breakouts I still have healing from two months ago. This has been a huge ego boost and I can't imagine not having this stuff now. Love it and no side effects at all.	8	July 6, 2019	6
Aczone (Topical)		The Aczone made skin without acne look flawless however I still had acne	4	June 15, 2019	3
Aczone (Topical)		This topical gel is incredible! My acne started to become an issue about a year ago and it has been an ongoing struggle to control/eliminate it.  I have tried many other topical creams as well as an oral antibiotic that worked for a short period of time.  However, my dermatologist finally prescribed the Aczone 5% gel and my skin has drastically cleared up within the past month or two.  I currently experience the occasional blemish, which comes in much smaller than before and it clears up quicker.  I highly recommend the Aczone gel for anyone with acne prone skin!	9	May 28, 2019	6
Aczone (Topical)		I had clear skin until I had children and it has gotten worse over the years. I have now been suffering with acne for 20 years and it only gets worse. I have been using Aczone 7.5% for over a year twice daily. It does help shrink large inflamed cysts, but definitely doesn't stop the acne. I gave it 4 stars because it does help with inflammation and doesn't cause dryness or peeling, but if you are looking for something to prevent acne this isn't it.	4	May 3, 2019	6
Aczone (Topical)		I have struggled with cystic acne my whole life (I am now 26 yrs old), and was desperate to find a topical that was effective. Aczone has been a game-changer for me! My breakouts have all but been eliminated-- and when they do occur (hormonally), they are much smaller and last for a shorter duration. I use it once daily, and it does not leave my skin dry or oily like most other topical ointments.		February 2, 2019	10
Aczone (Topical)		I am a middle aged male and have been experiencing problems with acne for the past 8-10 years.  I have been on accutane 4 times and would exeperience clear skin for about a year every time after my treatment. My acne would always resurface, and it would be an uphill battle to keep it at bay. I would also like to add that I experienced breakouts most frequently during the winter months.  After habitually visiting my dermatologist, I was finally prescribed Aczone but did not expect much from topical treatment.   I have been applying for about six months and my skin is not only completely clear, but I am able to actually touch my face and eat foods I NEVER use to eat in the past.   I strongly recommend this product to any male experiencing the problems I have. Acne is the most frustrating situation I had facee, and it killed my self esteem.  If you have severe cystic acne, I suggest you clear it up with accutane and immediately switch to dapsone to keep it under control.	9	January 17, 2019	23
Aczone (Topical)		If you have never used this product, try it.  It might just turn out its works just as good for you as it did for me! All I can say is, it works, it works, it works.  I have tried so many things including other RX that didn't have any results. I am 40, and used aczone (dapsone) gel for 3+ years now. The results are awesome, and yes I had every type of acne you can think of everyday since a teenager. Since using this medication once a day I have NO acne, zero. Even scarring is reduced. Talk to your doctor,, and all the best for success using this!	10	December 17, 2018	19
Aczone (Topical)		At the end of October my almost 14 year old who had always had such great skin started to have terrible breakouts.  We tried so many OTC products and she cut out sugar, dairy, and would drink gallons of water each day and it seemed to get worse.  I took her to a wonderful dermatologist on Nov. 26 and she prescribed Aczone 7.5%. She started using it that night.  She has not skipped one night and after 2 1/2 weeks her skin looks SO GOOD!  The reviews are right, you won't see immediate results, you have to BE PATIENT.  She continued getting a new pimple almost everyday for the first 2 weeks, but they cleared up so fast and the last 4 days she hasn't gotten anything new and everything else has faded.  She washes her face with Cetaphil, waits 20 minutes to apply the Aczone, then waits another 30 before applying her Cetaphil night cream moisturizer.  She plans on using this for a very long time!  Please don't give up right away,  I know it takes a little longer for some people.	10	December 14, 2018	22
Aczone (Topical)		Great product. First off, Aczone will not give you immediate results. That’s for sure. But it IS worth the wait. Prior to Aczone, I had tried EVERYTHING. Over the counter, prescriptions, professionally done facials, you name it. I was given Aczone 2 & 1/2 months ago in combination with Sulfacleanse (a wash I use once a day) and my skin is almost completely clear. I also take Minocycline twice a day. It definitely doesn’t guarantee perfect skin but you WILL see a huge improvement.	8	November 30, 2018	8
Aczone (Topical)		I have tried every recommended acne product whether it be topical or tablets and this is the only thing that has worked INCREDIBLY well for me. I was prescribed this in August 2018 along with Spironolactone (commonly used for high blood pressure but works to kill acne by slowing down oil production) and my skin is perfect right now. I'm not going to lie it was a little rough in the beginning 1-2 months in I was getting quite a few pimples, many flare-ups randomly. But it went by so fast I don't discourage this product because of that. I went from not wanting to go out of the house most of the time to leaving with no makeup on every day, you need to try this! The only negative thing is that the Aczone is expensive. My insurance doesn't cover it but it's so worth it to me. Hope this helps!	10	November 27, 2018	15
Aczone (Topical)		I randomly started having moderate cystic acne when I turned 20 and tried everything over the counter.  I finally went to the derm and got 20 mg doxy twice a day along with tretinoin cream .25% at night. It helped a little but not to my liking... she then gave me aczone and my skin cleared up so fast. I have been clear for about 3 weeks now for the first time in at least a year. I am still on all other medications (doxy and tret cream) and am so happy I started to use aczone. I am wondering, has anyone got clear skin with aczone? Also what happened when you stopped using it, did the acne come back?	9	November 6, 2018	4
Aczone (Topical)		Growing up I has always had clear skin, and then at the age of 22 my skin FREAKED out. I had extremely bad hormonal acne, at least 14 white heads at a time that hurt so bad. I didn’t even want to leave the house. A dermatologist prescribed aczone and benzoyl peroxide face wash and iIswear that the aczone is what saved my face. My face is 100% clear now in just a few months. Just a few red marks that still need to fade are left. aczone gave me my confidence back.	9	November 2, 2018	9
Aczone (Topical)		The first time i used this product, I used it with tazorac, and it cleared my skin up nicely. I have had trouble with acne on and off since I was a teen. It cleared my acne up in a few weeks but completely dried my skin out around my mouth. My lips started peeling and turning brown even lipstick didn't help. Derm recommended cutting back use to every other day. Didn't help. I stopped altogether and my lips and mouth area returned back to normal. 5-6 months later I started aczone again since my acne has gotten so bad. I made sure to stay away from my lips etc, got a great moisturizer to keep area hydrated and now I have a red rash around my lips and nose and on my lips.... guess I'm having some weird reaction. :(	3	October 26, 2018	7
Aczone (Topical)		TRY IT OUT! I'm a mid-30 yo female that has always been acne free. Stress and bacterial infection from clarisonic caused acne break out all over forehead and cheeks. My dermatologist has put me on Solodyn 55mg and Aczone 7.5% once a day. Here's my routine: Daytime - Purpose facewash, Kiehl's calendula toner, Aveeno posivitely radiant spf30 moisturizer. Nightime - Purpose facewash, kiehl's calendula toner, Aczone, after 5 minutes CeraVe oilfree PM moisturizer, oral Solodyn. I have been applying Aczone for 2 weeks and it has drastically brought down the inflammation along with clearing some stubborn acne. I still have a ways to go, but this has made me feel so much better about my skin! Side note: 60gram bottle dispenses 0.8% - so it should last you 75+ days and the cost of Aczone without insurance is $75 - I called Allergan directly to get this info. Definitely try this out if you are dealing with inflamed, red, angry acne! I'll do another review at the month mark!	10	October 15, 2018	7
Aczone (Topical)		I’m 53 and my husband and I moved out of state because he got transferred and there was a lot of stress. I started breaking out so badly. I was freaking. As soon as we got settled in Tennessee I got to a dermatologist. She put me on Aczone 7.5 and it’s amazing. I had to be patient because it did take a few months but it’s so worth it. I’ll never not stop using it. My skin at 53 is more tone and beautiful then it was in my 20s!!	10	October 11, 2018	6
Aczone (Topical)		do not use this medication. I've been on it for months & I have worst acne than I ever have had! Find something else	1	September 30, 2018	4
Aczone (Topical)		I normally never write reviews, but this acne medication warrants it. I suffered the worst breakout of my life in May. I had tried everything under the sun to get my acne better. I was embarrassed to go outside my breakout was so bad. So, I went to the dermatologist and they prescribed me aczone.   I put it on when I got home, and my acne started to get better pretty much right away. It still took a long time for my acne to get better- honestly 4 months- but it did it's job and my skin has never been clearer. I would not have been able to break the acne cycle without aczone.	10	September 13, 2018	11
Aczone (Topical)		Only reason I am sharing this experience is because I've literally tried everything and anything you can imagine to get my skin clear.I have a stressful job which doesn't help either. I tried spirolactone which made my face even worse, and have tried every prescription face cream there is. I have very sensitive skin that is sensitive to hormonal changes. I went to the derm to get a cortizone shot for a huge cyst and was not planning on going on a new prescription cream until she recommended Aczone. At first I said no and accepted the fact that my skin was never going to be where I wanted it to be, but she gave me a sample to try before buying just in case. I was bored one night and decided to start trying it- what else do I have to loose?  After 3-4 weeks of Aczone, this changed my skin. I haven't had a prescription cream work this well and I am almost scared to post this to jinx it- but if you've tried everything and just given up, please try this.	9	September 13, 2018	14
Aczone (Topical)		I have been on this gel since a few years back when I first started to experience bad breakouts. I was started at the 1% gel, and saw very little difference. In the past year, I have been prescribed antibiotics, tazorac, even switching my diet as well as many other things to help my skin, and nothing worked. In the past few months, my dermatologist has had me on the Aczone 7.5% gel and this has worked amazing for my skin. I've experienced no purging or flakiness, and it has worked wonders for my skin. Although it works well I do suggest that you use a heavy moisturizer on top after it dries off if you are concerned about having dry skin. It has helped to control my breakouts, but takes significantly longer to get rid of larger cystic acne. Overall, this product has worked amazing	8	September 6, 2018	3
Aczone (Topical)		Growing up, I never had acne. It wasn’t until I turned 30, then all of sudden my face started breaking out all over my cheeks, chin and jawline. Hopeless, I went to a dermatologist who prescribed me Aczone 5% to be applied nightly along with a daily face wash and morning moisturizer. I’ve been on this regiment for 1 month and after using it every day without skipping, my face is clean and completely clear! I will say, however, that you NEED to be patient. After the second week, I noticed a heavier breakout in odd places, but my doctor told me that this would happen so I stuck it out. Most acne medications will not provide you with instant results as they need to remove the junk from your skin first. This is why you will break out around the second or third week. It may seem bad, but trust me, it just means it’s working! By the time the second week was over, I was left with some scarring, but continuing on with this product even diminished those as well!	10	August 26, 2018	12
Aczone (Topical)		I started to experience acne when I turned 11. Seems like the acne kicked into full throttle when the later stages of puberty began. And it’s been a battle so far. When I finally decided to visit the dermatologist, they prescribed me Doxy & Aczone. At first when I used the Aczone it made my skin look great. Better than it had in awhile, it seemed it was lighting the tone of my red spots! I’ve been on it for 2 and a half weeks & my face is AWFUL. (Now yes I do understand there is a purging period, so I’m gonna keep going, unless I don’t see better results in 4 weeks). I can tell it’s not my classic acne, because it feels buried under the skin. I highly recommend you try this product. Though it does leave blemishes from causing all of the rising to the skin, I believe it is working. But then comes my question. The Doxycycline takes around 6 weeks to fully kick in, and maybe I don’t need the Aczone. Because from what I can see, it’s causing my face to scar SO MUCH easier		August 15, 2018	2
Aczone (Topical)		I am 24 years old, african american female with caramel skin.  I have been on topical medications for my moderate hormonal acne. About a year ago my skin went crazy, went back to a dermatologist and was prescribed Aczone 7.5 gel. I 100% always look up reviews before I use a product, so I felt the need to write a review for my experience. It's literally amazing. You do go through a purging period but please stick with it. It's been 4 months, and my face is beautiful & clear again. Just have a couple of dark spots, but all in all I'm really happy with the results. Every now & then I get a breakout but it clears up quickly. It goes on smooth under makeup. Skin rountine am: neutrogena acne prone facial bar, aczone, (wait 10 mins) then apply moisturizer. At night wash face & put some retin-a cream for my dark spots. I use aczone only once a day. Please give it the full 12 weeks to clear you up, it works!!! I hope this review helped, the same way other reviewers helped me stick with it!	9	August 9, 2018	23
Aczone (Topical)		Aczone has been a miracle treatment option for my inflammation based, hormonal, PCOS facial acne. It clears up my acne literally overnight without drying out my skin like tretinoin cream does. It also does a superb job of clearing red splotches on my face and evening out my skin tone. There is no other acne treatment that has evened my skin tone. I really love this stuff! The ONLY downside is that it it so, so, so expensive.	9	May 23, 2018	7
Aczone (Topical)		I started using this when the dermatologist prescribed it to me and at first it worked okay. But three weeks in it caused me to break out and I now have the worst acne I have ever had because of this product.	2	May 3, 2018	6
Aczone (Topical)		It's been 1 week and not joking my acne has dried up. Its a miracle cream. I apply at night so I didn’t have to worry much about applying anything on the top of it. My only complaint is that acne scar are not fading away. Might be I have to wait for months but I expected the result quick. Anyways only scarring is left on my face otherwise all the bumpy acne are dried up.  I will increase my rating once I clear up all my scares within a month.	6	April 17, 2018	2
Aczone (Topical)		I never suffered too much from acne as a teenager. I would get some breakouts here and there before my period. It wasn't until I was 24 that I started getting bad acne on my cheeks. I went to a dermatologist and she said it was hormonal. She did prescribe me antibiotics and aczone. At first it did burn when I put it on because I had a lot of acne on my cheeks. It does take about two months to see a complete change but it's completely worth it. My skin is the best it's ever been.	10	March 12, 2018	5
Aczone (Topical)		I started having adult acne after stopping birth control. I tried atraline and it helped for a while but my face always peeled. It never adjusted as promised. Then the acne came back. I was put on an antibiotic. It helped. A lot. But then I had to stop taking it because you can't take those long term. My doctor then suggested aczone and it's been the best thing I've ever tried. No acne and no peeling skin.	10	December 27, 2017	6
Aczone (Topical)		I’ve been using aczone 7.5% gel once a day full face and my skin has never been clearer. I didn’t have much acne as a teen, only small pimples on my forehead, but once I hit my early 20’s I started getting breakouts all over, specifically cysts and pimples on my chin and center cheeks. I soon realized this was probably hormonal acne and after trying prescriptions such as epiduo forte and veltin, I realized that products that dry out my skin are not the answer. After hearing that aczone had been seen to help women with hormonal acne AND doesn’t have a drying effect like most other acne products, I had to give it a try. Not only did it clear my hormonal acne, but even took care of the small pimples I had since my teen years. Simply amazing!!!	10	December 19, 2017	6
Aczone (Topical)		I'm a 59 year old woman and have never experienced an acne problem until recently.    Two weeks ago my Dermatologist prescribed Aczone gel 7.5 to be used once a day.   I have noticed a substantial decrease in my breakouts.   I know it's early in my use, but as of today I would give this a high rating.    I will report back after a more extended use of the product.	6	December 18, 2017	4
Aczone (Topical)		"Had acne in my 20's, now the painful cystic acne in T-zone is back during menopause.  I've been using aczone for about 2 weeks, once or twice a day.  Results: I have no - NO - bad breakouts and the ones I had are almost completely healed. The only reason I didn't give this a 10 is because it's only been 2 weeks and I don't know that I won't have another breakout tomorrow.   But knock wood, ""so far, so good""."	9	October 29, 2017	7
Aczone (Topical)		I've been using Aczone twice a day for 4 and a half weeks for my red pimples. When I went to my dermatologist she put a needle in each pimple it was a medicine which helped a little bit. And ever since using aczone nothing worked. It clearly says after a specific period of time if the cream doesn't work change it to a new cream or gel. This cream is not so great. Giorgio armani CC cream works for my skin way better, and the dior nude air powder is great for my oily skin.  I will definitely get a different  prescription cream.	4	October 21, 2017	1
Aczone (Topical)		Works well for my cystic acne. Non drying. Also have noticed that it has helped to even out my skin tone.	9	October 20, 2017	5
Aczone (Topical)		I had an adult onset of acne at age 37. Out of nowhere I had 10 to 15 pimples on my face... minimum. I made an appointment with my dermatologist. She put me on Aczone. I used the coupon online and got it for my co-pay (much cheaper... as it is pricey). I used it once a day. At first my face dried up and my acne increased. However, after a month I went acne free...since 2013! If you can get past the first month... you will be all clear! However, once your face is clear you may be tempted to stop! Please don’t... as acne may return and you’ll have to start all over. Just my 2 cents!	10	October 14, 2017	15
Aczone (Topical)		So I'm almost a month into using aczone twice a day and minocycline 100mg twice a day. So my face us actually getting worst 	1	September 10, 2017	6
Aczone (Topical)		So I recently visited a dermatologist due to hormonal acne. Never before did I have to worry so much about my skin that it would drastically affect my mood, social life, etc. I've spent so much money on better skincare, higher end and full coverage foundations - nothing was working (tea tree oil, spot treatment, apple cider vinegar, legit tried everything). The derm prescribed me 100mg of Spironolactone - but said it takes a few weeks to kick in. I'm on my third week and honestly not many changes. In addition she prescribed me Aczone. I don't know if this is just not strong enough for deep acne, but I apply this gel on my affected area multiple times a day and it has not gotten better. I think it may be better for smaller whiteheads, etc.	5	September 7, 2017	3
Aczone (Topical)		I have used Aczone 5% for over 2 years. It worked pretty well to manage minor breakouts and is much less abrasive than other topical acne treatments (both OTC and prescription). I still struggled with cystic acne, so my dermatologist also prescribed an oral medaction called Spironolactone. I take 50mg 1 daily. Boy does that really help my cystic acne! That medication when used as prescribed at higher dosages is to treat high blood pressure, but it has been found that in doses 50-100mg to treat cystic acne.  I have extremely sensitive skin and have to be careful with what products I put on my face. I recently made the change to the 7.5% and am experiencing some redness and irritation. Does anyone know if this will subside overtime?	8	August 23, 2017	4
Aczone (Topical)		I have been experiencing cystic acne for about 3 months now. My doctor had put on adaphlene cream and doxy antibiotic pills the first 2 months which basically purge out all sorts of acne. I was aware that it takes roughly 12 weeks to see results but I was just getting worse. My doctor ended up referring me to a Dermatologist who told me to continue with the adaphlene cream 0.1% at night. He took me off of the doxy antibiotic and prescribe me the minocycline 50mg 2 times a day and Aczone gel 7.5 once day as well as wash my face with Benozoyl Peroxide wash. The acne is almost gone after only being on the new medications 2 weeks. All I have left now is the horrible hyperpigmentation from the acne and it seems to be fading gradually too.	7	August 9, 2017	8
Aczone (Topical)		So I have used the samples of this medication and it worked great, but recently I got my prescription filled for it and it seemed to exacerbate cystic acne on my neck, jawline. I read the ingredients and it contains a form of silicone that can worsen cystic acne. Is the sample formulation different or did they change the ingredients recently?	4	August 8, 2017	5
Aczone (Topical)		I didn't find this helped at all. Made it so much worse if anything. Until I came across a mudmask and a blemish treatment which I was told would help out a whole lot. And it did. Because of the mask being made from all natural ingredients... it cleaned it up a treat... whilst removing all my blackheads at the same time! It's definitely the best thing ever for drawing all the crap out!!	2	August 8, 2017	6
Aczone (Topical)		Help! My skin seemed to be normal with few breakouts... I started aczone 7.5 and it is terrible! Pimples and redness all over my face! Is this normal?!? Should I wait it out?! It's been about 3 weeks.	1	August 7, 2017	8
